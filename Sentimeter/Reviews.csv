I order 3 of them and one of the item is bad quality. Is missing backup spring so I have to put a pcs of aluminum to make the battery work.
Bulk is always the less expensive way to go for products like these
Well they are not Duracell but for the price i am happy.
Seem to work as well as name brand batteries at a much better price
These batteries are very long lasting the price is great.
Bought a lot of batteries for Christmas and the AmazonBasics Cell have been good. I haven't noticed a difference between the brand name batteries and the Amazon Basic brand. Just a lot easier to purchase and have arrive at the house and have on hand. Will buy again.
ive not had any problame with these batteries have ordered them in the past been very pleased.
Well if you are looking for cheap non-rechargeable batteries that last quite a while then these are perfect. Nothing more to say.
"These do not hold the amount of high power juice like energizer or duracell, but they are half the price."
AmazonBasics AA AAA batteries have done well by me appear to have a good shelf life. I'll buy them again.
I find amazon basics batteries to be equal if not superior to name brand ones. Can't believe I didn't start buying them sooner! The packages are large and the price is great too.
"When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others). I have not done any tests, but feel some other brands may last longer. However, the price is hard to beat."
"Use it for my fish tank's light at night and works great, I love how you can easily switch it off and on if you want it on while guests are there."
"just got em so I can't really comment on how good the do the job, good price, quick delivery but have only put two into one of my keyboards but they can go up to a year so who can say after three days"
we have many things that need aa battery they are great
Thankful that I was able to find on Amazon for a great price and even better shipping. Arrived in perfect condition and did exactly what I needed it to. Great purchase and would purchase again.
I don't know if I would buy thus brand again seems like they don't last as long as Duracell
"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking."
They don't last as long as the brand name but are good enough considering they are much cheaper.
Bought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries . I also used some for my doorbell and just now needs replacement batteries. Tv Remote control is still working but these batteries don't last very long...
This my second order and they seem to work as good as name brand and ship to my door.
This was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great. Just as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price. This will be the only way I purchase batteries from now on!
They last as long as Duracell batteries in my Xbox one controllers and none of them exploded like some of the reviews said.
they seemed to not last as long as other name brand names disappointed!
These do not last long at all very cheap batteries no happy
have not used yet but a battery is a battery good price
"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"
We've ordered these a few times cause we've been so happy with product. These are good quality. We are also happy with price. I would recommend these.
HAVE NOT HAD CHANCE TO USE ALL OF THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM WILL REMAIN IN GOOD ORDER FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME MEANING A FEW YEARS OUT.
"these were under a light we thought they were there to fit the light when they arrived and nice company they were not the batteries we needed it should have been aa but that is ok,it was our fault not knowing this. thanks.."
"I use these batteries in my game cameras and they work great, last several weeks."
Very convenient to have a box of batteries and at a good price. No longer need to compare pricing in stores. Should have done this long time ago.
Not much to say about batteries except they work for a good price. Having a hundred let's me share with kids and grand kids.
They seem to work okay so far and the price was great.
I use them for my Xbox controllers and they last pretty long. Great for a cheap price.
Seem to hold up as well as any name brand and at a much better price
Works just as well as every other brand of battery with a better price. Powers all of my sons toys for months at a time.
Just got them so i really wont kno for a few eeeks or so how good these batteries are
These last as well as Energizer- half the price.
"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity."
"3rd purchase of these AA from Amazon, all have expiration of 2027. Ones I've used thus far last as Long as name brands"
I am 100 satisfied with my purchase of these batteries
"I put these batteries in 10 of the 12 window candles that I bought - I put my last 2 Duracell in the other 2. The Amazon Batteries lasted for about 10 days and the Duracell lasted for 12. Since then I've experimented to see if this is consistent . It is, the Duracell last an average of 17 longer."
"First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batteries."
Seem to work very well at a great price.
These batteries don't last even in a simple digital clock. 2 weeks at best.
"I buy AAA and AA batteries about 4 - 6 times a year. I made the switch to Amazon batteries about 2 years ago and never looked back. These batteries work just as well as any of the name brands, but at a much more reasonable cost."
"Date on the back of these were 1992. Yeah, 1992. Inedible."
"GOT THE 48 PACK, I USEDD THEM UP FASTER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD!!,SO IM ORDERING MORE !! SO IM ORDERING MORE NOW"
The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.
I definitely love the price and quantity.. My kids go tthrough them to fast. At least these will last a while..
They worked and great price.
Batteries. Standard AA kind. We use them everyday. They power many things and these work as good or better than any others.
Excellent performance and better price.
"Arrived earlier than expected. Amazon batteries are not only affordable, but have a long life."
Excellent
Great product!
They're batteries!
LOVE THESE BATTERIES! BETTER THAN DURACELL AND SAVES ME MONEY! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT AMAZON!
"Amazon you rock! These work better than name brand batteries and cost nothing. Have the same nice feel of expensive batteries too. Perfect in my opinion, will re purchase!"
Amazing so far. These AAA's are even more affordable than the brands at WalMart. Will update if they end up not being good.
works great
I am happy to report that this order is working fine with no issues. I am very satisfied with this order and plan to buy again from same seller. Thank you. Jn
"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"
Battery storage life only lasted 8 months (stored indoors).
A good bang for your buck!! Almost everything now a days uses batteries.
"If it's possible to have gotten a dud batch I sure got it. We BLEW through all these batteries in less than a month. My kids toys aren't that super powered and even in remotes I was having to change batteries way too often. For example the magic touch counting toy, the store batteries lasted 3 years. Popped in some Amazon batteries, 1 month and the second child didn't play with it nearly as much as the first. For the price it was worth the try but I'm going back to the other brands."
NICE PRODUCT
Great basic batteries! Fantastic price. I like having a stockpile. When my kids get toys at Christmas I feel like Oprah. YOU get a battery! and YOU get a battery!...
"Some day we will probably look back and chuckle about 'primitive' batteries like these. But not yet. They are an integral part of our daily lives. We need food, drink, shelter, love, and BATTERIES! You can't beat the price/quality combination."
A battery is a battery these work just as good if not better than the name brands like Duracell or Enginzer
"I like to have a good stock of batteries in my home. I am a repeat purchaser of these and other sizes. So far no performance issues. Lasts like Duracell. They might consider improving the graphics though, not very exciting to look at."
These worked out great for his battery powered cars I got him. What a awesome deal.
"I used to buy batteries from Costco which come under Kirkland brand. I thought of testing Amazon Basics based on my experience of other Amazon Basics products in the past. These batteries are way better than Kirkland, Energizer and Duracell. The cost is nicely placed. Now my kids have more time to play with toys before the need to replace the batteries. A clear thumbs up!"
Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.
Got it and it's already in use.
Never purchased these before ... Work well so far
lasts just as long as duracell
I bought the smaller pack last time and didn't realize how quickly it runs out. Very happy with this amount of batteries.
Like that I can buy these online and in bulk. Have ordered them several times. A good buy
What can I say Thes batteries work as xpected.
This large pack of batteries is a cheap alternative to buying other brand names and are particularly useful for gaming. The battery life is every bit as good as the brand name batteries as well. I use these batteries for frequent gaming to power my controller and headset.
Good deal for rechargeable. They all work and seem to preform well.
Good batteries at a good price
They seem to have some good staying power and are cheaper than most other brands. I highly recommend as this box lasts quite a few months with the kids mainly using these for xbox controllers.
These batteries are a good value and work well. I have used them in the past and would recommend them to all.
A friend advised me to buy my batteries from Amazon. Her family swears by them. I am now using them and agree they are a good buy for the money and I am not worried about running out of batteries or running out to have to buy them.
"Batteries are pretty much of a commodity as long as they do what they're supposed to do, so I ordered these based on their price -- much cheaper than what you can buy in a store. And these batteries seem to last as long as any of the name brands. A good value."
These Amazon batteries seem like a good value.
Everyone needs AA batteries. These are fine and a great price!
"so many batteries, so little money. A great deal"
Works great for everyday AA battery needs
"I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack. The price was right and the batteries are working very well. This is really a bargain."
"Great buy for the money - these batteries work very well. I've gotten them in the past. The best part is that they are so inexpensive that you can run through them, and not feel like you're running through your bank account!"
"A great deal, and the batteries have a good life to them. I will buy again when I start running low."
"All I buy now is AmazonBasics when it comes to batteries. They are long lasting and a great price. I have tried the AA, AAA, and 9-volt. As a cheap shopper, I am pleased with their performance and price."
"Between LeapPads, Xbox controllers and remotes, we use batteries a lot. These have held up great with a comparable lifespan to other household brands."
I buy all my batteries here. Great long lasting batteries.
"You know those crazy cheap batteries that are so light you practically hit yourself in the face when you pick one up These aren't those.I've already purchased a couple sets of these and have been really happy with the quality/lifespan. I'd say they're DEFINTELY comparable to the more expensive name brands. I've happily recommended them to friends and family, and it's so handy always having plenty of AA batteries, especially around birthdays and holidays!"
My PS3 remote control and my television remote controls work again thanks to these AAA batteries.
"As a teacher, I need tons of batteries, but I refused to spend excessive amounts on them, so I figured this was the best option! They are long-lasting, worth the money, cute (if that even matters, lol)! You won't find a deal like this in stores!I highly recommend!"
"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these."
"I can only use these on those indoor flameless candles and even then, they dont last very long...a little disappointed..."
"Lieutenant Dan got me these batteries. So then I got a call from him, saying we dont have to worry about batteries no more. And I said, thats good! One less thing. -Forrest"
"A lot of batteries for the money. So far, all working well."
Great Batteries
I happen to have remote controls in our house and this item certainly is a must in my living room.
"You know you need them, so why not get a bunch. I'm the battery guy for the kids toys, so I have to keep them on hand at all times!"
"Worked exactly as they are supposed to, good price, good quality. lasting a nice long time, A good buy."
"This is a great purchase. My outdoor cameras on my house them. Compared to the leading namebrands, I find these to last longer. I am getting four months per pair of batteries instead of three months with my surveillance cameras."
"I've been buying AAA alkaline batteries in packages of four at the dollar store and thought I was getting a pretty good deal on the price, but it bothered me to have to throw away so much packaging every time I needed four batteries. Then I was checking out a fellow reviewer's profile and found a review of the AmazonBasics AAA batteries. He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money. I've used them (so far) in small flashlights and in one of my TENS machines. Great performance. The price (which seems to fluctuate) is less than I was paying locally. Best of all, you get 36 batteries in a tiny cardboard box that measures 4 1/4 x 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. There are 9 sealed packages of 4 batteries each, but there's much less waste in the packaging. Amazon claims 10-year, no-leak shelf life for them, but even I use batteries faster than that.I think this is a great product at a great price and I love the packaging. Glad I stumbled onto them."
"Thats a whole lot of batteries! I ordered the 48 pack of AA batteries and its so much cheaper than a much smaller branded pack from the big chain stores. They arrived packaged well and wrapped nicely, see included pictures for details. I like to keep extra batteries around because most new electronics do not have included batteries these days. I hate getting a device in the mail and scavenging the house for batteries or stealing them from the remote controls. At this price, we can all afford to keep a bunch on hand. Ive tested these on several devices so far and they appear to be comparable to brand name batteries, they last a long time and bring all my electronics to life with renewed vigor. I'll definitely be buying more in the future."
"of course these are no energizer bunny batteries, but for the price and amount you get, you cant beat it! They come in individual packs of 4, inside a white box to keep them in. I would recommend it"
"A good deal, well packed in reusable package"
During my first recharging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off. A waste of money
TERRIBLE! Barely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where Duracell lasts multiple days.
I bought these batteries to use with a battery operated pump that transfers gas from a gas can into the tank of my riding mower. This is a far better way of fueling my mower than trying to lift a five gallon tank and trying to empty it into the mower tank. The pump uses 4 AA batteries and that is the way the Amazon batteries are packaged. Having them bundled in foursomes is convenient. My pump runs perfectly with these batteries.These batteries are said to have a shelf life of ten years so I won't be having to buy more AA batteries for at least that long. The price of these batteries is a genuine bargain and is it highly recommended to get this offer if AA batteries are needed.
Seem to work fone for a fraction of the price!
Good price. Good product
Great battery just as good as the name brands.
Great value
Perfect and what a deal - very pleased!
The batteries works very well. Great quality. You can't beat the price
These batteries are as good or better than any brand of alkaline battery on the market today.
Great value!
Greaatttt deal. This probably the only way I'll be buying batteries at a good price too.
Works just as well as any other battery brand we have bought!
A+A+A+A+A+ FAST DELIVERY JUST AS DESCRIBE
Good price
"They are batteries, they worked, enough said....."
A great deal for the price. Let's hope these alkaline last longer.
These batteries are as good as other brands and a bargain to boot.
AA batteries are replacements and have worked well so far
AA batteries worked as advertised.
Awesome buy. Very happy with these. This is my second order of these batteries. Will continue to purchase when needed.
awesome so far no duds
Came fast. Great price. Seems to last as long as expensive batteries.
"Good price, fast shipping, Will shop again."
Good value. As good as Duracell
Great Quality ...Excellant Price
"High quality. great value, as advertised, trusted company.. Will definitely buy again and tell others.You will be pleased."
I bought this for a friend.
Never can have too many.
"So far I have had no complaints with these batteries. I was hesitate at first because they were cheaper than your big name brands. I figured they may not last long. But I was proven wrong. They have lasted just as long as the big name brands, and they are a lot cheaper. I buy these for work and for home. They do not disappoint me at either place."
These Amazon AA batteries are great. They are just as good as any high priced battery.
"Yes, I'm using these and they are as good as any other battery."
Good price and good product.
I was very impressed with the packaging of these batteries. They work as well as any of the top commercial AA batteries. I will keep them handy for any future use.
Another great offer from Amazon that delivers perfarmance and price for your electronic agenda 1
"These batteries are exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for affordable AA batteries with a long shelf life that I could keep around for an emergency or extended power outage. These Amazon alkaline batteries are advertised as having 10 years shelf life, and after receiving them I confirmed that on each battery is printed the expiration year 2025, which is what I expected having bought them in 2015.Now I won't have to by ordinary batteries that end up discharging internally in just a few years. The environment and my pocket are grateful. Thanks Amazon!"
"Great deal, better than local stores"
Last just as long as other less expensive brands.
"I purchased these to compare against the Duracell's I normally buy. These appear to be an excellent value, but only time will tell. Currently I am using them along with the Duracell's in some fake candle lights that my wife has to see if they last as long as the Duracell's. So far so good."
These are really good batts and a great price.
AA batteries worked perfectly out of the box!
Works good so far. Time will tell the true story. Great price!
They are batteries...what can I say!
"Excellent batteries and it's a better value than buying the batteries in smaller packs. Amazon's batteries are just as good as other manufacturers. With the subscribe and save, it's even a better deal."
So far the batch is worth it. The batteries are solid and work well. When they are on sale they are worth the buy.I recommend and would buy again.
AA! Would buy again!
They work!
they work. good price. as expected
A wonderful way to purchase these.
work great
"As advertised, I have not had any problems."
As expected. Like the box they came in.
Good value for the money Will order again
great batteries
Great price!
I find these packs of batteries are less expensive and I always have some available - no running to the store for a battery
Needed some more batteries for the home and these were reasonably priced. Have been using for a week and so far they are working well.
These work just fine and were purchased at a good price.
Very nice packaging. Good batteries.
We'll See how they last.
Batteries. AAA. They fit and work in objects requiring AAA batteries.*Not for internal consumption.
These don't last long at all.
AAA batteries. They last adequately and are at a very competitive price point. For that reason I don't think I will be buying batteries from any competitor if they're more expensive than these. Bravo Amazon.
Love these batteries. They last just as long as the top name brand battery for a fraction of the price. Look no further. Check out the discharge and compare. They are solid!
"I have been using these batteries for some time now and they seem to be holding up as well or better than any name brand I have used in the past. The price, packaging and shelf life make Amazon batteries a winner."
No troubles
"Use these in a wireless BT mouse. Has about 30 less life as copper top brand. Good price, but most likely will not buy again."
Great product and u can't beat this price anywhere
You can never have too many batteries. Fair price and and lasts as long as the bunny ones.
"Lasted about a week in my electric toothbrush. Energizer and Duracell brand lasted a month. Tried with 4 different Amazon batteries, same results. Very dissatisfied"
Good less expensive bulk pack. Great alternative for toys and games that seem to eat batteries and won't break the bank. Seem to work well enough and rival the name brands. Will buy again.
You get what you pay for in life bht for the lrice and amount these are actually great one say or two days of strong power for flashlights or wireless headphones etc. For remotes theyblast for quite a while. Package was nice fast delivery thunking of actually buying different sizes for other electronics ...would definitly order again ...kinda like gas not premium or regular something like a plus ....lol i have tried all those other expensive brands thats supposed to last 10x more longer well by the time you pay for one pack and get maybe a months wirth depending on usage you could have a 100 of these and still have left over......just saying your not buying tires or brakes for your car so test them out they sell it in smaller amounts and subscdiption amount etc....
For most applications they seem to do a decent job. Have used them for about 3 years.
"They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them. In my Xbox controller they lasted an adequate amount of time. So all in all these definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflects that."
Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics AA batteries. Not surprising until I tell you that that AmazonBasics batteries were the last to be installed and the other half were installed long before the AmazonBasics. I don't think I'll buy these again.
Nice price for a bunch of batteries.
"AAA batteries - lots of them, at an affordable price. What's not to like"
Work better than the Kodak batteries that I had previously
"I have 2 kids, and they have a lot of battery powered toys. We tried rechargeable batteries, and they didn't hold up like I was hoping. These batteries are more affordable than brands at the store, and I can't tell a difference in performance."
Great deal. They are what they are but seem to hold life pretty well. Will definitely buy again when I need to restock.
This is an affordable set of rechargable Alkaline batteries.
"They are very affordable batteries. I have not run any specific testing, but so far, they have performed well, and appear to give good battery life."
I didn't know Amazon makes batteries at a very affordable amount. Now i know where to purchase batteries.
Affordable. Long lasting battery life.
Mediocre performance
like it for the money
These are alright batteries works well on remotes and other little gadgets. I just like my energize battery or the copper top battery myself but my husband got these for the smaller items around here.
These batteries are very durable. AmazonBasics did very well on this product.
GOOD ALKALINE BATTERIES. AREN'T ALL ALKALINE THE SAME ADVERTISING STEERS SOME PEOPLE.
"We use battery operated candles with timers. The batteries normally have to be changed once a month. These cheap batteries lasted 2 weeks. I thought these batteries were a good deal, but I was wrong."
All the batteries came dead so I did a return and got new ones. Second order was the same as the first.Update: still have yet to receive refund from second order after several weeks!!!
Work well at a lower price. All is good.
all dead
"a couple of low juice ones, but I bought a charger and all is good"
"Maybe mine is a bad batch, had a serious leak on one of them, these batteries seem to last as long as duracells but duracells never leaked in my experience"
Always a good buy!
Always a good deal
"Just as good as name brands, lasts longer and no mercury."
With all the electronics in the house we go through abundance of batteries a month. This is a great deal and they seem to last quite a long time!Have mine set up to be shipped every month definitely the best way to go!
Damn that's a lot of batteries!
"Amazing product, love it. Used it first thing"
"Love these, never had any problems and you can not beet the price! I not only buy them for home but also for my job."
These are great. How is Duracell still in business
"Using in my Xbox One controller. Battery life is on-par w/ Energizer and Duracell, and like a zillion times cheaper."
Amazing and affordable.
I don't think I'll ever buy duracell again
"Amazing deal on these batteries! We have six kids so we are always needing batteries for something - whether it be a game, or a computer mouse, or whatever ... we always need a good stock of batteries. As far as holding up and doing the job, they seem to be doing great! I will update if I find any problems. So far, so good. Will need to buy more once Christmas gets closer."
"AMAZING DEAL!!!So many batteries for an amazing price!!! In the stores, you get half the amount of batteries for double the price.100 will re buy.work great. FAST SHIPPING TO! (ONLY TOOK A DAY)"
I have truly been converted form any other battery brand to using AmazonBasics! Very happy with the life of these batteries!
Great batteries at a fantastic price. Don't buy your batteries from Wal-Mart when you can get more than twice as many for a cheaper price on Amazon.
"really amazing price and really great product. From my experience, Amazon products are pretty good quality. I will be buying this over and over again."
"Such a steal for so many batteries. Not only are there a ton of them, they last for a long time. A loooooong time. My rechargeable AA for my gaming mouse usually hardly makes it past a couple of days with my usage. I haven't had to change one of these yet and it's been weeks. More than satisfied."
"This batteries were dirt cheap, way cheaper than buying batteries in the store. They arrived in a nice, compact cardboard box and they last a long time. You will not be disappointed because these are not cheap knock-off black label batteries."
Great product! Affordable and reliable!
"These are an amazing product for the price. We use a battery operated sound machine for our son to sleep to, and these work just as long as the Duracell batteries we were originally using and I love that they come in 4 packs within the box, which is extremely convenient so we don't have batteries floating around once they fall out of the box."
Tons of batteries for the lowest price I've found. Superb product by amazon.
"I bought this for my dad, I buy Anker for all my cable and power needs, and once again, they did not disappoint. This is a must buy!!!!"
"You put these little cylinders in stuff and it makes them work -- flashlights, remotes, kitchen scales, clocks."
You can always use batteries. I used these before and they seem to last pretty well.
Great batteries.
"Iv'e got these batts in a bunch of holiday candles. Going strong. Great price. If they poop out early, I'll update this post."
These have tested ok so far.
"Good buy on batteries,long life."
Great price and solid performer!
Good batteries. All fit in the uxcelPlastic case for AAA batteries...
"Amazon Basic Batteries are the best, I buy them in all varieties."
You have to love AmazonBasic products. These batteries are first class and an excellent value.
Not the first time I have bought Amazon Basic products and won't be the last. From my experience these products do just as well as any name brand product but with less experience. Love the packaging these batteries came in and so far from what I can tell work like a charm. Put them in a couple of my gadgets and worked perfectly. The way we go through batteries the cost savings is well worth it.
Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries... Great prize so far no problems with them.
Great batteries at a good price!
Excellent product!
Prior reviews were very good on these batteries so we thought we would give them a try. So far so good! All are still working as described . Will change review should we need to- but now highly satisfied .
"Great batteries. They perform well, definitely not cheap batteries. I will probably purchase more as the price is just right and you get about 20."
"They are batteries, they work and they last...What else"
I've never had a problem with any of Amazons stuff. I actually prefer it over namebrand because of the cost-effectiveness if it's not something that's going to show and look tacky I could care less... batteries are one of them
"These are decent but I find they last about 20 less than Duracell batteries, but considering the cost difference they are actually worth it."
"Amazon basics batteries are just as good as the name brands from my experience. Well packaged in easy open box, whivh I appreciate since I have arthritis. Box is small enough to keep the rest of the batteries from getting all over and easy to find when replacement is needed. A"
Great battery deal! I have now used 6 batteries and have not noticed any difference between power length compared to duracell or energizer. They last just as long and work fine. I am now buying these because of cost savings.
I started buying these large packs of Amazon batteries because of the great value and previous experience with Amazon Basic products. These batteries seem to work as well as my Energizers and Duracells at a fraction of the cost. I will be buying more AA and AAA when I run low. That should take a while with this large pack.
Work great and are a great price. Can't beat that! These seem to be on par with low to mid tier brand battery live so can't complain.
These are quality batteries...just as good as major brand names. Can't beat the price. Thank you.
"So far, these hold up really well. For the price, they are simply unbeatable. They come packaged in a small, generic box. I've now tried 4 AmazonBasics products, and I haven't got a complaint about any so far. Amazon seems to not only want to make cheap products, but they also don't seem to want to get complaints and returns as well. Who has time for all of the mess So, do it right the first time, and see what happens.Thanks for another great product!*If my review was helpful in any way, please click the little YES button. If not, just laugh and move on."
Batteries that get the job done. Cool packaging. Amazon claims another industry.
Nice. Great for the price.
These batteries seem to last as long as the more expensive gold/black batteries. All of the Amazon Basics items we have bought have been of excellent quality.
"I like the Amazon line of Basics. Nothing fancy, they just work."
"This is a great buy and last along time, Amazon Basics is great ."
"I don't know what you expect to read here. Some elaborate review about how these batteries are amazing from the packaging to the ease of installation etc No, they are AS A batteries that are cost effective and do their job properly. No.magic smoke yet so can't complain. 10/10"
Batteries don't last very long compared to Duracell or Energizer
Don't waste your coin of the expensive store brands. These work great.
I always try to buy Amazon rechargeable batteries. Good price and lasts a long time between charges. Saves a bit of the environment compared to disposable ones.
OK
Quite a bargain.
Works great and holds chaege as well as and battery I have had
"First time I've used these batteries, so far so good!"
"Great price, and I'm very pleased with performance."
I love these batteries. Affordable and have worked well in all our game console controllers and kids toys that are frequently used!
Great batteries for the money
"My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can't trust these batteries."
"I use hundreds of AAAs annually, and despite the graphics in ad, these are about the poorest performing, with least longevity, of any I have bought. Still have another 100 of these, but will likely go thru those quickly."
I'll never buy another brand again. Amazon batteries last! Quality and affordable!
What else can you say Amazon ROCKS and so do their batteries!!!
GREAT!
HOPE THEY WORK!
"First of all- buying batteries is never fun . It's also quite expensive. I fell in love with the fact , I could buy these Amazon branded batteries through prime and get them in two days .But guess what. I got them in 1 day!!! Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive."
These work great. I primarily use them in my xbox 36 controller and they last as long if not longer than any other brand i have used. I highly recommend them.
"good price, worked fine"
Cheep and effective these batteries compare to mainstream manufacturers without issue. The price tag is so much lower that even if you didn't like them or felt that a major manufacturer was somehow better than this you probably still wouldn't regret the purchase. They hold their charge and last just as long as anything else. Amazon Strikes again with a great product
Seems to be as good as the average battery bought in a store. Nice amount for a good price. I buy all my batteries from Amazon now
"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other brands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer."
Great for the price and last long
stronger than duracell and so much cheaper. amazon keep up the great work
Does not last as long as Duracell quantum. These were sent as a supplement
"These are budget friendly but don't last! I bought for my battery operated candles that typically use batteries for 6-8 weeks. Twice these batteries barely lasted 1 week. It was so disappointing. Amazon produce are usually so good, but I would not recommend these."
Great value
"Batteries were inexpensive, work well in multiple devices.I hate running out of triple A batteries!"
Perfectly sent perfectly usable
Amazon batteries over good performance at a great price. Nice option to replace more expensive name brand batteries.
They're batteries. Significantly more cost effective than Duracel Energizer. Rated 4* because I can't yet say how they last compared to the two big brands but so far they're performing well.
Love this particular packaging arrangement. I think 48-count is the way to go in the future.
"Amazon's batteries are great. I've had no problems with them leaking or corroding. They last as long as any other AA battery I've used too.The AmazonBasics brand has been great for so many different things, and I definitely recommend these batteries."
"I just love Amazon's batteries. They last just as long as the name brand batteries, but are much less expensive."
"Great batteries. So why not 5 stars I haven't used them long enough yet to know their life expectancy, and it would have been more convenient to have the packaging to be resealable or with fewer in the same container. I ordered 20 and it came in two 10-pack sealed plastic things. Not a big deal, since I took care when opening them. All remotes and appliances that I've inserted the new batteries into are still working perfectly after a month. That's all I ask."
Not so surprised as AmazonBasics delivers excellent product. Work just like the Energizers and last as long.
"Arrived quickly,great price seem to be high quality so far"
"Everything we have around the house uses batteries, so we go through them fast. I like purchasing in bulk because I don't have to purchase them as often and they are a little cheaper that way. I was a little nervous to purchase the AmazonBasics brand, because I wanted to make sure that I purchased a quality battery. We normally purchase Duracell.I am happy to see that the quality is just as good as the other brands we've purchase and at a fraction of the cost.We will be purchasing these again in the future."
I thought I would give these AA batteries a try. I have always used Kirkland brand and never had a problem. These are a few cents cheaper. I will see how long they last compared to Kirkland brand (Costco).
Excelente puedo recomendarlo ampliamente.
"Great Price, Great product."
"Have this as a subscribe save item, so when I run out I just order more."
The juice in these batteries aren't long term.
Eight AA alkaline batteries... not too much to say: New. Shrink-wrapped. Delivered quickly safely. Work just like we need AA batteries to work.No problems here.RecommendedGo for it
"These batteries are typical alkaline batteries. I recently put them in a couple of remotes that needed batteries and these worked fine, At this point, I can not say what their longevity will be. They work well in the devices in which I placed them."
Great price! Just began using these batteries so their lasting ability is yet to be determined. DFD
Very good batteries for the price...Much better than purchasing batteries locally in a 4 pack...
I thought this was a great investment I wasn't wrong these batteries are just as good as any other. I will be ordering these again..
These were exactly as described arrived on time (or maybe earlier than the delivery date specified). They work just fine I'd buy them again. And the BIG plus is they were a LOT less expensive than buying them from a brick mortar store work just as well! No problems :)
Nice battery and price. Have not had any problem with them.
"Initial charge upon receipt was higher than the name brand batteries I usually get, I'll definitely be ordering more when these are about gone!"
I tested the lifespan of these batteries with my Wireless mouse. Lasts just as long as Duracell CopperTop AAA.
no point in spending money on brand name batteries. these are a great product at a very reasonable price. i don't buy any other brands.
The RIGHT item delivered FAST at a GOOD price. What more can you ask for They are AAA batteries work as expected.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack). We subscribed to this. The batteries are holding up just as good as any other. You can't beat the price either.
Good batteries work as described
"AmazonBasics AA Alkaline batteries, are generic alkaline batteries as good as Duracel Rayovac."
"AmazonBasics has become a great brand that rivals the Energizers of the world. These batteries are an affordable price and a really high quality, especially when compared to the competition. With having a three year old, we are constantly running through batteries and it is great having these AmazonBasics type products out there to help middle income families like ours afford all the necessities that comes with having kids and just life in general (think remote control batteries)."
AmazonBasics are a tremendous deal. I bought this 36 count AAA because it cost about the same as 4 pack of name brand. If ever I give an electronic gift I include these with the gift.
I just put 4 of these in my flashlight they worked. It is too soon to see how long they will last. I have had great experience with other amazon basics products ( the wireless keyboard mouse set)So I decided to try the batteries-- so far so good
These are great batteries at a great cost. I will continue to purchase these. I replaced batteries in my outdoor solar lights and I have many and these work great. Highly recommend.
We order batteries keep them stocked at all times. We also order AAA Batteries for the same reason.
"No issues with these batteries. I've started buying all of my batteries from AmazonBasics, especially the AmazonBasics C Cell Everyday Alkaline Batteries (12-Pack) for the holidays and AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack) for everyday items.Bottom line: I would recommend this to a friend."
These are great. I used to have to go to Costco to get the equivalent number of batteries at a discount. Now I can get these batteries in a couple of days from Amazon.
"I've been impressed with the performance and quality of AmazonBasics battery. Though the price point is pretty low, don't let that fool you - they are every bit as long-lasting and durable as the brand-named batteries on the market. In my opinion, there's no reason to spend more on a battery because of it being a name that you're familiar because I can tell you that my experience has been amazing. And honestly, I can't tell the difference between AmazonBasics batteries and other batteries that I've bought in the past that has cost me much, much more money!"
"Everything about AmazonBasics is amazing. Anything we have ever ordered that was AmazonBasics has always worked beautifully. The batteries arrived, in what would appear to be recycled packaging, which is good on them. No issue with any of the batteries we ordered, including these AA."
All Good
"Amazing Value, they shipped free on Amazon Prime and they are as good as any other."
A great price for a large amount of batteries. These last just as long as name brand batteries if not longer!
AN AMAZING PRICE FOR 48 VERY HIGH QUALITY BATTERIES. loved this pack. the batteries come in 4's in plastic inside a big box
"I'm always leery about ordering offbrand batteries, because it seems like so many of them are total garabge. But I've been really pleased with these, they are holding up as nicely as the energizers we were spending much more for! I will definitely buy these again when we run out!"
"Packaged very well,just what I wanted."
"Batteries packaged well, and are working just like any other battery"
"The only way to buy batteries. Large quantity, and great price."
"Ordering in bulk for batteries makes my life so much easier. I have kids, and they always need a battery for something! I have AAA, AA and other sizes on hand all the time, and I love never disappointing them! They have tons of battery operated toys and games and Amazon makes it so much easier than running out to the corner store and paying double!"
"I purchased this product for my own use, and Ive found it to be a great product. Size, fit, quality and the whole mess is top notch. I have to admit I was a little hesitant at first, given the price, but after opening the box I immediately realized I had made a good purchase. I can imagine using this item for a long time, and should I need another Ill likely buy one just like this."
Great batteries and even better price.
"These seem to work / last like any other quality battery. Packaged well. Great price. Thus far, every AmazonBasics product I've bought has been high in quality (and great in price). I'm expecting the same here.Keep this up, Amazon, and I'll keep coming back."
Amazon Basics comes through with yet another superb value. These work every bit as well as their Energizer and Duracell equivalents at a fraction of the price. It comes in a nice carton that is perfect for storage and can be recycled when the batteries are gone. Highly recommended!
Worked as advertised.
"use these batteries specifically for amazon devices, they give long lasting performance."
"This is like my fifth box of these batteries and they last as long if not longer than any others I've purchased, including the copper top and the bunny.All Amazon products from their basics to their electronics can't be beat. Very BIG fan of Amazon branded products. The only thing I don't buy from Amazon is perishable foods. Man would I love to see one od their food stores in Santa Fe!"
AOK
"great price, very good batteries"
AOK-AS ORDERED
"So far so good. I usually buy Duracell, but I trust amazon... sooooo I tried these. No complaints thus far"
These batteries rock. They have one of the best performance to price ratio's anywhere. We use large numbers of them to power microphone transmitter packs in our theater productions. Those are applications where they cannot fail. These outperformed the ProCells we have been using. I recently bought 900 of them for our production of the Wizard of OZ. They worked flawlessly. They are our new standard battery.
"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again."
"Run of the mill batteries, for the price and convenience, especially with Prime shipping, are a good buy."
arrived and worked like a charm!!
The batteries arrived in a timely manner. I was in need of a battery for my wireless mouse and after Alexa placed y order this package arrived in record time to my door.
Product as advertised. Arrived on time and in good condition. Good value! Will buy again.
Average value in quality.
As always...reliable and well packaged.
As described
Received the batteries as they were described. So far the ones I have tried have worked great.
Batteries came exactly as described. I have only used a couple of them and they work great in the remote..Time will tell about shelf life...
AA they work
as expected
As expected.
"As expected from Amazon, there were no problems with the ordering and delivery process. So far I have installed several batteries, but it's too soon to tell how long they are going to last."
As expected. Batteries at a good price. Batteries come in a brown box. Inside the batteries are in groups of 4.
As expected. Nothing special.
GREAT VALUE
I work in an electronics lab and did a test against the big name batteries and the discharge curve and performance was exactly the same as the brand that stars with E !!! Very good value
They seem just as good as any I have bought from the store. I have used them for countless things and have had no problems. They came on time and it is great to have the convenience of delivery.
"I bought these batteries being skeptical about their price and quality - since when were store brand batteries ever really good and worth the cost Well Amazon will surprise you again with another great addition to AmazonBasics. These batteries are as good as if not better than major name brands. I have been using these batteries in devices that typical run down alkaline batteries in a couple of weeks, and so far these batteries have lasted twice as long. I have not noticed any problems or differences with these batteries, and I have yet to test them with my voltmeter for consistency however, I have noticed no issues or problems. I usually prefer to use rechargeable batteries, but these make using alkaline batteries worth it again."
"I was skeptical at first, but these AmazonBasics batteries are pretty competitive to Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries."
The Amazon batteries seems to have an acceptably long life compared to much more expensive brand names. My one complaint is that they recently upsized the box the smaller package was much more convenient to store the batteries in.
you can't go wrong with this. quality is as good as brand name products.
as good as costco
"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review."
As it should be...AAA Alkaline battery. Can't beat the price and quality. Holds up well to its competitors. This is a no brainer if you like to save money.
I love Amazon basics batteries. They last a long time and are cheap. Plus the packaging is convenient.
"These work as well as any standard-type batteries on the market. They last just as long as the name brand batteries. I don't know how well they store because I have been giving a lot to kids who had inferior batteries in their handhelds. I ran out that way. They use those handhelds constantly, but they haven't had to replace any of the batteries I gave them (it's been a couple of months). Other devices have had these batteries for six months, now, and are going strong."
Great price and they seem to last as long as name brands.
These are just as good as any other battery as far as I can tell but cost far less. Great option if you use lots of batteries! Tired of the store ripping me off when I need a couple.
"Was worried these might be low quality, but they have performed about as well as premium brand batteries. Will reorder when more are needed. Can't comment on leak resistance yet, but everything else seems top notch."
"As good as the brand name batteries at considerably less cost. I have tried numerous off brand batteries in the past. None of them have ever lasted as long as the name brands, and some were almost dead right out of the box. I have found these batteries to last just as well as the name brand batteries, in both the AA and AAA sizes. I have not tried the D or C cells yet."
"Bargain of the year. Have already used a dozen for various electronic items and they are, so far, performing as well as the name brands If I find they quit too soon I will update the review"
As good or better than any major brand out there.The price is a fraction of what the major brands are.Time will tell what the durability is.This proves what a rip off battery prices are from the major brand manufacturers.
"As a Mom of 3 young kids, we go through batteries very quick! I've tried all types of batteries from name brand, to various store brands. Amazon compares to the top brands I've used, and in fact I would consider it a top brand. They last twice as long in my son's wireless PlayStation controllers than the Toys R Us brand we were previously using. You can't beat the price for the quality and I will only buy Amazon batteries from now on!"
"I have used these batteries for several years. As good, if not better than any other top name brand."
As if Amazon had to be any better at anything else. These batteries are great. I was skeptical but you can't beat the price and they last a long time. Must have if you have kids and their toys that require a lot of batteries.
Batteries kick ass. Just as good as name brand. Would purchase again!
"Price per battery is great. I checked the voltage on some of them and they were all at 1.6V. I think they will last at least as long as the brand name batteries, although I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn they are all made by the same people and just labeled differently."
Great !!!A lot of batteries.Last long and don't leak.
Lotta batteries. at a good price.
"At least half of this batch had no charge, or at least so little that they died within an hour of being put in a walkie-talkie. Very disappointed"
Batteries work better than the ones I recharge. So I'll probably buy batteries in bulk instead of recharging from now on. I'll still need to buy rechargeables for my solar devices.
Its works perfectly for me in many of my devices. So I like this.
These were OK. I don't think I'll but them in the future. I prefer Energizers.
Last about 8 hours of non stop use which is about average. But the price was AMAZING!
"Decent battery, but seem to change them out a little bit faster than the big name batteries."
These batteries won't last long. An led flashlight will drain them in a hurry. I usually like Amazon products but this is one to avoid.
A lot of batteries for a good price! Came on time!
These batteries are a no brainer. They work great and the price can't be beat.
Awesome
"Great deal, packaging and shipped in a timely manner."
Great scotts that's a lot of batteries and definitely a life saving price
Great!
"just as expected, awesome service"
Outlast name brand batteries. This is a great product.
Works great just like the expensive brands
Yay! The best price and great quality
Love Amazon Batteries. This is the first time I have tried the Performance line. So far so Great :)
I thought theses would be crap like the typical cheapo batteries. But to my delight they are actually pretty decent quality. They do not last as long as I would like but for the price I can not complain.
"Love love these batteries, great value"
Amazon Basics - you are my hero. These are great batteries. I use them in my Apple keyboard and mouse and they have outlasted the brandname batteries I used to use. I get on average an additional 1-2 weeks of use out of each set of batteries which is an additional money saver. The shelf life seems to be normal for alkaline batteries.The packaging is biodegradable which adds to the convenience and value.
"I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. Other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it."
"These are by far the best value for your money while getting good quality batteries! I will never purchase another brand again. Purchasing these only costs a few dollars more than a small pack of batteries at Walmart but you're getting a lot more and stocking up. I have noticed absolutely no difference between the Amazon basics and the name brands like Duracell, Energizer, etc. I highly recommend these batteries"
These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
"These batteries are a great deal! The price is very reasonable and the life of the batteries are just as good as any major brand. Now that I have tried these out, I will purchase the amazon brand for all my future battery needs."
"This is actually the second or third time I have ordered these and by that evidence it should be obvious that I really love the quality and value of these batteries. I have bought the crappy ones from the dollar store but they seriously don't last. Not worries with these bad boys! I don't need to replace them anymore often than the name brand . If this review helped you, click YES below. Thank you!"
I love these batteries. I am so happy that I bought them. Batteries are super expensive at my local retailer. It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me. I hope you found this information useful to you and thank you for reading.If you found this information helpful please click Yes on the link below. I greatly appreciate it.
Great for the price
Ordering more. What's that tell you
What a deal! Awesome now I always have plenty of batteries at home. Also this was a very good value for the money.
Love these batt's! Long life! works great in toys all other items!
Awesome for cold/iced drinks! Keeps ice cubes from melting fast. Love this product! I wish they have a set for each design though.
"They seem to be holding up just as well as the top battery brands, for a fraction of the cost! Another great product from AmazonBasics-I will be hunting for their other products now!"
"awesome price for decent batteries. they hold up fairly well, haven't run them through any rigorous tests, but when I put them in the remote control it seems to work again."
"Awesome price, awesome batteries. I will never buy batteries anywhere else again, this deal is hard to beat."
Batteries are what you expect. They work. Price is awesome
"Tried these for the first time last night. Played indoor with my wife and 12 and 6 year old daughters. Awesome time! Beats sitting around the table playing a board game. I will check back in the Spring to see if they are still working. So far, I highly recommend."
great money saver! will repurchase when i get near running out.these are great to have on hand (especially when it always seems that you need new batteries for everything at the same time).
"Awesome value for the price! I haven't had a single problem with these batteries and I've used them in remotes, cameras, toys, all kinds of stuff. I'll never buy batteries from the store again!"
Boom-Shacka-Lacka-Lacka! Great price!
Great batteries for a great price. They last just as long as the name brand batteries do.
"I've bought these before. They used to have a different design, but with the new design comes longer life! I love these, especially for the price. Definitely last as long as the name brands!"
"We love these batteries! Better pricing than the bigger brands, but work just as well and just as long! Go Amazon!"
Everything came as described and fast delivery (:
Still running strong after I had a string of battery-operated lights on for a whole week (in 8-hour shifts of darkness).
These work very well! Thank you for making a battery at a reasonable price!
Not good
"I've been using these on my roku remote and the lifespan is terrible. About two weeks, when Duracell's have been 1-2 months"
Awful poor performance. My mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again.
"Well, these are basic, average, ordinary non-rechargeable AA batteries. You get 100 in bundles of 4 tightly wrapped in plastic, all packaged in a plain corrugated cardboard box. The price is good. The batteries are plentiful. I've read reviewer complaints here that the battery quality is inferior, that they don't work, or explode, or ooze, or don't last very long. I can't tell you about this. I don't have a battery tester and nor do I have the ambition to set up a test involving these vs. some top brands to see which work better and last longer.Don't try to charge them (duh!) and just use them. I'm not a big user of AA batteries and now that the World As I Knew It is coming to an end, there will probably be plenty of these still in my house when that end arrives."
These batteries do not hold charge well. By the time I need to use it few weeks none of them work
"BAD BATCH NOT LASTING!Have been using these for the Roku Remote, and they are dying after just a few days of use.Have been happy with Amazon battery purchases in the past.Not sure if the quality is overall lower than it once was, or if this was just a bad batch."
They for really fast
Some of the four packs (02-2027) are bad upon first use.
Theses did not work. Wanted to make sure I had batteries for the item I was purchasing but they did not work. I had to dig some out of my junk drawer.
Wrong item.
"They last a day in an xbox controller, if you're lucky"
Many of the batteries are no good.
Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.
"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again."
"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
"Fantastic bargain and holding up well months later. I go through a lot of batteries, like almost everyone nowadays. So I searched for a better deal. I think I found it here. A big savings over grocery store batteries."
Good price and good batteries.
"Great deal. I go through these like water through a sieve. USB mouse, flashlights, etc."
Works great and seems to last as long as my other batteries.
A lot of batteries for a little money. What more could you want
"good bargain. haven't had them long enough to determine life, but so far so good!"
Great bargain.
I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.
Good batteries at a good price. They do the job. I've moved almost everything to AAs and need to keep disposables for hurricane season (no power for weeks) These are just right.
Good amount of battery for the price.But they are not as long lasting as Duracell
Basic AA batteries for a good price.
"Easy decision, the amazon basics line of products has always worked well for me, and amazon customer service on their stuff is amazing if you need it.There is little difference in Alkaline batteries. (Costco hits top rank in consumer reports, but I have not seen their amazon battery rating.)But ordering from amazon is so easy, and the quality is good"
Great batteries at a great value.
"The box is actually quite nice for storage. It is flat, and easy to open."
"What we expected, a bargain battery, so we are happy."
"Using my el cheapo multimeter (Fluke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerance for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available."
A nice bunch of batteries that work exactly as supposed to. Basics indeed!!
Are batteries. Do work. Yay.
"Basic, alkaline battery, highly rate by CU"
Nice cheap batteries. A lot of them for the price . Will buy again in like 2 years lol
About what I expected. Good quality and is as described.
are batteries
As expected
"Batteries, they work."
"cheap batteries, not much to report"
Does the job
Excellent batteries they are very useful in our home. Thanks Amazon
Good value.
great
Great deal and last as long as the major brands
great price
Great price.
great value. I will purchase again.
"I decide to give it a try. And it is too early to decide how it turns out. But so far, look good."
"Just batteries. Nothing was wrong - it's nice to have so many batteries at home for this price, that's it."
"Like all of Amazon's products, these work well."
Lots of energy !!
Love these batteries. Not only do I not have to go to the store for batteries but they seem to last longer then most of the batteries I have bought in the store. We use alot of batteries between my boys and their toys but also for cordless mics since my husband is a DJ. The big test that won me over was when you do toasts at weddings and announcements. We are able to use a set of batteries for more then one wedding
"Love these, I go through the batteries so nice to get more for my money."
Nice flat packaging. They work for a long time.
Pretty sure these batteries are way better the name brand batteries! Don't get sacked into name brand when you can get just the same from the amazon store a
Standard batteries. Comes in a nice little box.
Such a great value!!!
The product came on time and as described. I am glad I bought this! I always research before I buy and this was a good deal.
"They are batteries, what can I say. Bought as gifts to go along with the candles."
They are batteries... They do last a while though in the R/C toys we got for x-mas. I would buy these again over more expensive name brands.
They make things work!
They work well
They're batteries. They work. Simple as that.
This is the item I was looking
"Very happy with purchase, very powerful."
Work as described
work as name brand
Work great
Works great and last a long time some of them are still working
Works like they should.
Pros: Good batteries. I like the easy subscription option which helps make them even cheaper. Packaging is nicely done.Con: Found them cheaper.
Batteries are awesome!! They are cost effective and last just as long as Energizer or Duracell. I have used these in both low drain (toys and small electronics) as well as high drain devices (Cameras and high powered LED flashlights). Using the Subscribe and Save makes them even more cost effective.
Batteries are batteries. These seem to work fine and the price was right.
"I looked at the average rating of the major battery brands (EverReady, Duracell, Rayovac , etc). they all rate the same as these. Same complaints from the one and two star raters. I conclude batteries are batteries. So, I bought these and I've been happy with them."
So far so good
They're batteries. They make small devices work. What more is there to say
Batteries are batteries are batteries. These are good. Last as long as they should. Came quickly.
Batteries are batteries these seemed fine for us! They lasted the whole Taylor Swift concert! Don't really know how long they last total.
"Batteries are great, price isn't the best. I've seen similar packs of generic batteries for cheaper. Wegmans comes to mind.."
Batteries are great.....I need them for my work for my camera for taking pictures on the job of properties. Nice to have extras on hand at an affordable price. I don't see that they last any less time than the name brand batteries.
"I used these batteries in a Canon 420 Speedflash. Normally, under multiple exposure (around 3 shots per second), using standard alkaline I'd get 3 continuous flashes before a miss, or with fancy High Discharge Rate Flash batteries (translate - Expensive!), I'd get 5-6 continuous flashes. The last photography shoot, I was asked to get back-to-back images of a person at a surprise Birthday Party. Imagine my surprise when, upon entry of the victim, I captured 9 continuous exposures with perfect flash! I am very impressed!These batteries are high quality and surprisingly powerful!"
"Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap"
Batteries work as promised. So far they seem to last and have not had any issues. Our kids blow though lots of batteries and for the price these are a must have.
"I don't have any little kids , however the big boys seem to ear these batteries just as quickly. Price was great. Satisfied our' needs."
"They're normal batteries, I just love that I could order them online and have them shipped with the wireless mouse I ordered the same day and have them arrive at the same time!"
good part is that they give you a lot of them. bad part is they die way too quickly.
These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.
"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand."
This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.
"I have two Macs, each with their own wireless mac keyboards. I used these batteries in both keyboards and each worked great for several days. My desk keyboard failed to connect last week so I attempted to replace the batteries, but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out. I assumed it was a chance happening. But now my wireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed. The batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out. Amazon refunded us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboards the batteries ruined."
Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again
Fabulous price! And the batteries work great! I'll be buying all my batteries on Amazon from now on.
Same price to buy all these as it is to buy an 8pack at the store. Why pay more They same to have a similar lifespan. I haven't noticed any difference.When I retire in 30 years I'll probably buy an other case to get me through my last years. But these should last until then.
Are you like me! Do you have 46 devices in your home and they all seem to use AA! Amazon batteries are great quality super inexpensive and easy to get! It never fails that you need one or two batteries at 9 am or 9 pm and don't want the hassle of getting in the car for that 20 minute (or more) round trip to the drug store. A must have on the list of things worth having delivered to the house!
"So far, so good. They are what they are supposed to be. I will check back after using and see if they have long life. BTW, packaging is very good."
What's to say They're batteries and they're from Amazon. Just another staple item you'll need at a great price. Why shop anywhere else
"hey, they're batteries. They do what they are suppose to do."
I love that it comes in a box. So smart for batteries. You don't have a lot of loose batteries like you do once you open a blister pack.
Great product at a great price
Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids !!! Big disappointment too - won't buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there !
"Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point."
I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Bought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photos and the batteries are now dead. What a disappointment.
"Batteries ok ok , but a fan of their packaging."
Amazon rocks. Great batteries at the click of a button lol!
I don't think I will ever go back to Costco to buy batteries. The price is awesome for the quantity and they last just as long as name brand batteries.
2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.
Batteries seem fine. Hard to tell if they are as good as name brand until I use them for a while.
I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China
packaged per 4 they seem fine
Batteries seem to last a good amount of time. Good value. Much better than going to a wholesale place and ending up with a pack where 50 of them don't work.
Came as advertised. Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great. Even the paging they sent it in was greatPlease Vote YES on my review!! Thank you
Batteries seem to work fine but they are packaged in multiples of 4 and it's an annoyance to break open a new pack each time. What's the point in buying in bulk with so much packaging
These seem to last just fine for games and toys. Great value.
I tested each of these batteries and they were indeed batteries. Would buy again!
Great Batteries. Love the performance and value. With all our remotes and other battery demands this batteries will do the trick.
Difficult to be excited about AA batteries but everything about the purchase was as advertised. They were well packaged and even arrived several days early. They are working well. My regret is that I did not order AAA batteries at the same time.
"Batteries that work. Seem to last the same as other major brands, but cheaper to buy. A no-brainer."
None of first eight batteries I opened worked. Tested other batteries to confirm was a battery problem. Confirmed!!!Wow.
Batteries were packaged good and seem fine
Batteries where used in mt solar light actually work well! Amazon could sell rechargeable that is some thing I'm very interested! I use a lot during summer and winter!
"So far these batteries are perfect. I put a fresh set in my electric toothbrush and thought my teeth were going to buzz out of their sockets. Not really, but they do seem to have more 'juice' than the national brands, if that is possible."
We like them
"We have been using these batteries in some kids toys and they work fine. I haven't noticed them lasting longer or shorter than others. We normally purchase the Kirkland brand one from Costco, and these appear to be equivalent. Its great to have a large supply of batteries on hand when you have kids!"
Batteries work fine and are less expensive then all of the others on Amazon for sell. Nothing more to say!
batteries work great for my xbox controller. I get the same amount of time as any other brand I have bought.
"These work great! First time I ordered them, but they were a great price. I love ordering from Amazon and hate getting out of the house so I will continue to order these."
Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.
"Batteries worked great at a reasonable price. I used them in an xbox one controller, which can eat up batteries, and received similar battery life to more expensive name brand batteries."
"Batteries, nuff said."
"Just started using this pack, and so far they've lasted as long as any leading brand battery. The price is also fair, for the amount that they offer you."
"Yup, a bunch of batteries."
Always needing AA for toys. Include in my subscribe save for convenience. Seems to be a quality battery and up to par with other brand name batteries. Will buy again.
They are functional batteries. Nothing really special aside from being Amazon branded
Anything from Amazon Basics is AMAZONG.
"Batteries! So far no problem with any I've received, they do the job!"
Good product at great price!!
"Average batteries, functioning as expected, at a great price. I think I'll see if they've got some AA's at a comparable price."
As expected
They're batteries. I'm not really sure what to write here. They were packaged safely. They arrived. They power the little LED lights I bought on amazon. Yay batteries! I can't speak to how long they last because who actually pays attention to that I'm using them to power little tap lights.
They are batteries....
"They're batteries, they work. I'll post about it I see they don't last very long, but I've gained a lot of trust in Amazon brand products so I'm fairly confident."
Good batteries for cheap!
Batteries...what can you say
Good
great price
"Living in a remote control world like I do I use a pretty fair amount of batteries, I find that these Amazon brand batteries are just as good or better than the copper top, or energizer, the price is competitive with the other brands , Kirkland, acdelco, rayovac, the preform really well in all devices, and the shelf life is great, I would recommend highly,"
This is a real Bargain folks get'um while you can...
I change the batteries at least once a month. These things eat batteries like crazy and are hardly used.
Breaks down too fast and won't run my trail camera but around 6 hours.
"Trust Amazon Basics products. Work like the top name brand products, but at a greatly reduced price. Use these in my bike lights."
My remote wouldn't work so I took out my batteries and noticed the end of one of these batteries leaked all along one side of my remote.
"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat."
Leaked all over our lantern battery case. I purchased these batteries for an emergency since they had a long shelf life. I put 4 batteries into each of my lanterns and 2 each into my flashlights. I have multiple battery leaks between the lanterns and flashlights. I ended up spending over an hour cleaning up the battery cases and flashlights. I've purchased the AAA pack as well and don't seem to have the same problem.
"These batteries did their job but did not last very long at all. At the time of writing this I used them about two months. Normally that would be good, but I only was using them in a set of LED string lights that I kept on at most an hour a day. In the past month I barely used them at all, because the batteries had started to die and alter the color of the lights. I had expected to get a lot longer use out of them, considering other brands I only need to change every six months at earliest."
I've had several of these 'fail' long before they should have. Several instances of having to replace them much sooner that competitors batteries.
This item arrived with no battery pack. There is no way to power the toy without it because you can't just use regular batteries.
"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. At first I has hesitant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong...."
Battery replenishment
Easy to order easy to keep a reoccurring order if you tend use batteries often. I don't notice a difference between this brand or a more popular branch in terms of durability. We keep them on hand at our house because you never know when you'll need one or four of them. I'll be ordering them again soon.
great buy
These batteries are the best! I love amazon branded items!!
"Durable, long lasting, ordering again !"
"They're batteries, they work that is all"
"My bluetooth mouse and keyboard eat batteries, so I liked the idea of a big pack that I could just leave in my desk. These batteries are pretty woeful, though, lasting only about 1/2 as long as the Duracells I get in the grocery store."
Be Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my TV remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity). One of the batteries was actually fizzling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I've never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again.
I installed three of these beautiful AAA cells into my bike light. Now I believe that I am less likely to die in a violent crash with a car.
High quality and quite decorative. Highly recommended.
"Been happy with Amazon batteries. Dont' see much difference vs the duracell that I usually buy. So now, i just the the amazon. This is the 3rd set that I have bought. They are so cheap that I give them with gifts. The parents and kids love me because they usually don't' have batteries."
Been using Amazon Basics batteries for awhile now. Very inexpensive way to keep extra batteries around all the time. We go through a lot of double and triple A batteries. Do they last as long as name brand I don't know but at least I can afford to have twice as many around for the same money.
Bunch of AA batteries. Been working fine. Seems to be a good value.
Being a gamer I go through batteries quite frequently. I do have rechargeable battery packs but I often forget to plug them in and I am too impatient to wait to play until after they are charged. These batteries have surprised me with how long they last in my XBox 360 Controllers!
"i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 aa battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thru for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-26really good product"
Amazon brand just as good as big name brands and way cheaper. Never buying another brand again!
"I prefer purchasing my batteries in bulk, so that I can buy them once and forget about them for the upcoming months (or year). AmazonBasics was, at the time of purchase, the most economical pack of AAA batteries.I haven't noticed any difference in time or quality of use. I don't use AAA batteries for many things, though, and for those that I do the items tend to last for quite some time on a pair of batteries, so I would not notice a change unless the batteries were really, really poor quality. Thankfully, they're not, and their price point made them a steal for me. These also store well - I have had no issues using some of these that my parents purchased years ago and they appear comparable to the pack I purchased recently.I've lately been really impressed with the quality of electronics that AmazonBasics offers. As store-brands go, this is among the first that has yet to disappoint me!"
"These Amazon AA batteries are better than other leading brands like Duracell or Energizer compared within the Alkaline category. I'm happy that I bought these as they are described as advertised. They last long and do not leak that nasty white stuff when you leave your batteries in a device for an extremely long time. I'm not sure about shelf life though as I never put aside a battery for that many years and tried it before, but I do believe these can last way longer than the other brands. From experience, I feel that these out last longer than others with normal usage. The shiny coating looks better than the white coat before. The price for a pack of these is also the best value than going to any actual store to buy them as they tend to be expensive. So far, every one of these batteries worked just fine with full charges and no dead ones at all. Very satisfied and happy I made this purchase."
"Best product from amazon basics,packaging is super good and easy to use"
Great batteries for a awesome price. Could not ask for more.
They last longer then I thought they would.Seeing how cheap they are.
Excellent value. Been using in all electronics and no complaints.
Just as good as Duracells for a fraction of the price.
Just an amazing product how can you go wrong.
You can not beat this deal anywhere. These batteries were just as good as the top brand batteries my husband always buys... if you are running through batteries all the time because of kids toys (which was my case) this will be a good deal for you! BUY IT!
"BEST BATTERIES EVERSeriously, way better than the two big brands that I have been buying for years.My insulin pump goes through one of these every 1.5 months were an energizer battery lasts .75 months"
"12 for a 48 pack. Very long lasting batteries. Just can't beat such a deal..Usually I would have something negative to say about a product, but I have nothing for this."
I bought these for my Xbox one remotes because the other brands I would buy dies way too quickly. I was a little skeptical at first because I had never heard of Amazon Basics but I'm glad I tried them. I play the Xbox everyday and the batteries have not died within three weeks. That's great quality.
These are by far less expensive and better than any AA or AAA battery and a lot less expensive.
"Wow!!!! I bought this sick to the wall light for a closet and it was dim really dim, even with rayovac brand new it was brighter but not impressive. Upon trying these out I was blinded by how bright it was. Box also works nicely to keep batteries in one place."
"I'll admit I was a bit worried when buying these because of the price, but they have held up and last a longtime. I highly recommend over the overpriced big brand batteries."
I got these for my grandkids toys and just got them cause they were cheap and would deliver. Well I was wrong! They been playing with their toys since Christmas and the batteries are still going strong. So my recommendation these are the ones to buy.
"These test full charge while the ones i have been buying are already partially discharged bc u cannot tell how fresh they r, even when they are adv as good for 10 yrs."
"Another great product from amazon. I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used. When it comes to any common battery size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), I will only be using AmazonBasics. Give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. You can't beat the price and/or quality."
Love the price... now I never run out of batteries... and they last just a long as other batteries I have purchased.
"Best value on batteries yet and surprisingly long lasting, high quality batteries by Amazon. Will buy more when needed."
Best price and easy to order. I only buy Amazon Basics batteries now.
You can't find a better deal
Best buy for your money
"Lasting power....I use them in a TENS unit. They work well enough as any. 27 cents per battery, I wasnt really expecting them to work so well but I was surprised."
You can't beat this deal!
"Best battery deal out there, And they work just as good as the name brands like Duracell."
"Ever since getting an insulin pump, I've been using more AAA batteries since my pump uses them. I was happy to find that AmazonBasics offers AAA batteries at a bargain price so that I don't have to spend more money keeping myself alive. Type 1 diabetes is expensive in itself and I'm glad that I can save, even if it's just spare change, on the products I need to purchase to keep my insulin pump going. I find that these last just as long as name-brand batteries and have had no problems with them. In the future I will be using Amazon's Subscribe Save program now that I know how long the batteries in my insulin pump last. Overall, I would recommend these batteries if you regularly use AAA batteries and like to save money."
"Trusted brand, good price."
I bought these for my wireless Apple mouse and keyboard that eat through batteries quick. They seem to last me just as long as Energizer and Duracell AA batteries at a fraction of the cost.
Work as good as Duracel and cost less. Not much else to say.
"These batteries are the bomb. They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price. They shipped super fast and there are so many that I still have some lying around from my order last year. Definitely will re-order when I run out. :)"
Best deal you can find for AA's. And the Xbox controllers last for days with them. Just like a brand name battery!!!
Best deal. Great quality batteries
"OMG! these batteries are so affordable! And it may just be my biased opinion, but they seem to last longer than the Duracell or Energizer batteries I buy at the store (maybe because they don't sit in inventory for goodness know how long). Regardless, these are my favorite AAs"
"The battery were pack in a plastic solid thing holding the battery inside of a very well made box. I have not tested the battery but the Do Not list is well thought out. It Has it in English,Chinse,Spanish,Dutch,French and One Other. This has to be why you should buy AmazonBasics battery instead of other people cause their prices higher than in stores for a cheap medium grade battery. I a real person and feel free to ask the oddest question.AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (8-Pack) - Packaging May Vary"
"Great product, long lasting with a great price."
I love AmazonBasics in general and this number of batteries at that price- you cannot even beat that at the dollar store even with their crappy low quality batteries.
Good batteries. Love them
"I like that these were wrapped in plastic in sets of 4 to help keep them organized. These worked well and restocked my battery storage area. The box was simple and compact, no larger than it had to be - this is never the case at big box stores. Thanks, Amazon!"
Great batteries. I don't think they last nearly as long as some of the bigger name brands. But can not be beat for price.
"long lasting and powerful. also, best pricing."
I have purchased Amazon batteries before and they last as long as the leading brands like Energizer or Duracell's for 3x less the cost. Most people nowadays are using rechargeable but there are a few things that still require Alkaline such as my temp signal transmitter for my digital clocks and a pair of these lasted about 9 months out in weather. Other brands died within a few months. You will not be disappointed.
I put these in a Pumpkin candle for Halloween and they lasted 4 days. I put them in a Flameless candle set of 5 and they lasted one week set on a timer to go on for 5 hours a night. These are really not economical. Best to pay the price for the good ones.
"We normally buy CostCo batteries, so we don't by the Top brand anyway. It's a question of value. If the top brand lasts to a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the best, longest lasting, battery life, and these only last to a 7 or 8 they are a great value anyway because they are 100 batteries for 22. That's just 0.22 per battery. Twenty-Two cents vs about 46 cents for the top brand is a pretty good deal in my book.Okay I might have to change batteries more often which I see is the only downside.Again it's all about value to me. These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are a bargain."
"Everyone needs extra batteries around the house. These Amazon Basics AA are in every control that I have in my home. As far as I can tell they last as long as the expensive main brands. Get a box of batteries, throw them in 'that' drawer, and never run out of batteries again."
"These batteries are great, and a real value when you buy in bulk. I would highly advise you to buy more then you need because the higher you go the bigger discount you get. They come shipped in very good packaging, and packed tight to keep them safe. If you buy many the packaging can be used for safe storage.The performance of these batteries is about what you would come to expect from Amazon. They on on par with more expensive Energizer brand batteries. The shelf life on these is also around 10 years. While I'm a big advocate for lithium batteries, sometimes you just need a less expensive option and these are always my goto brand. You will be hard pressed to find a better value for your money in terms of batteries."
"It seemed like everything I bought for my daughter required 12 batteries a piece! This is a great value. Now all her swings, bouncers, and toys are fully operational. I've purchased this size and others. No issues and will buy all my batteries from Amazon from now on."
"I looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar, including these, and these make the most sense price wise.I have tried HUNDREDS of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear. At a certain point they are just a waste of money."
Best value I've ever gotten on batteries. They last as long as a Duracell at about 1/8 the price
This is the best deal I've found for batteries. Now I can always have plenty on hand. The simple packaging is a plus over store bought blister packed batteries too.
Best value in batteries
"These are awesome. They're an amazing value - buying Amazon batteries in bulk is the best deal I've found anywhere. And the subscribe and save option is awesome when you have kids in the house - gadgets and remotes and games and controllers and toys, oh my! This keeps you ready and stocked.I also like the way they're packaged - plastic wrap is easy to tear off, but holds together sets of 4, all boxed together. Very handy.These are a must for any busy, budget-conscious parent!"
It's probably the best value for AA batteries out there. They function as expected.
"Amazon Basics batteries are my go-to favorites. I've tried several different sizes they've all functioned perfectly. We go through a lot of AAA batteries for electronics like trackballs and remote controls these seem to be the most reliable and longest-lasting I've found. Love the price the high quality. A terrifc value. Most highly recommended!--Have a question about these batteries Just leave a comment I'll be happy to help you, if I can."
Best bang for your buck. All the batteries last as long as leading brands for a fraction of the cost. We've got 3 kids and we go through batteries like crazy over here. I cannot even begin to tell you how much money these Amazon batteries have saved us! Thanks!
LOVE these! They last a long time and you can't beat the price! Great value!
"What I found was that in our Wii controllers and Xbox controllers, the rechargeable packs would die after a few months (maybe last a year)...but then I would have spent so much on the packs that I wouldn't want to replace them, so they would stay in the charger longer and longer and when we wanted to play a game, we only got 10 minutes of play time until the rechargeable pack was dead.Then I bought batteries at Walmart (Duracell) and used those...but it was so long between changes that when we wanted to play a game 6 months later, only half the controllers worked! And I was out of batteries!Then I got an Amazon Dash button for these and now all that is gone. I put the box of batteries downstairs by the Xbox and Wii. No more dead batteries!!!! The batteries are in bundles of 4. When we get low, I'll just order another box. Best way to always keep batteries available for controllers, remotes, and such."
The s e area great for all of the times you need this size of battery. The box they come in makes easier to find them in my grab all drawer.Just purchased my second orders onthese
Better performance than I expected. I feel like I get just as much out of these as the name brands and the price is fantastic. Highly recommend!
Seems to be equal to any other brand of batteries I have used.
These batteries work as well as any batteries purchased in a brick-and-mortar store. The best part is that they cost less.
The batteries have lasted just as long as any name brand batteries that I have bought. Will continue to buy.
Last a long time!!! Better than competing brands.
decent quality battery strength for price. better than dollar store for sure
I believe this one is more better than Duracell. Will buy again .
"Good value and better than Duracell, Eveready in my opinion, especially over rated Duracell."
"I used to use Duracells all the time, and then started having leakage problems with them. I ventured out to try these. Life seems to be as long in devices I use a lot, and they don't leak. I am done with Duracell, and will use these!"
I am highly satisfied with these batteries. I mainly use them with Bose noise cancelling headphones and haven't experienced any issues. They last longer than most batteries I have purchases and are much cheaper than competitor brands. A well deserved 5 star rating!
"Hold up really well in my son's toys, better than most so far and last a few days in my hubby's Xbox controller, but mind you the thing is hardly ever not in his hands so that's actually a pretty good span compared to others we've used."
Batteries have great life span. Highly recommend. They last just as long if not longer than the top name brands at a much cheaper cost.
"I love Amazon Basics! They are low cost, well made, and quality checked. Better than name brand. Only place to get cheaper well made batteries is maybe Costo and no buddy got time for that! :) ha!"
The batteries are great! They work well and the price point can't be beat. I especially love that these come on my subscribe and save order and I no longer pay for batteries at the check out counter in the grocery store.
I personally think that these batteries are as good as name brand ones for half the price! I primarily use these in my xbox one controllers and change batteries maybe twice a month of heavy play. Definitely worth the purchase!
"I love that Amazon offers its own brand of products for an amazing price! These batteries work just as well as any other brand I've purchased from the store, if not better. I have a remote control that eats through batteries (it also powers headphones so I don't disturb my boyfriend while he's trying to sleep) and so far these have lasted longer than the Duracell batteries I've been using. They were a better deal as well! I've already recommended these to my family and friends with children who always complain that all their kids toys requires batteries. I will be buying more!"
need these!!! better than other bateries
"We are having good luck with these batteries. The ones we used previously that came from the box store whose name begins with a C, have been known to leak acid in multiple applications, and so far these have been super in both AA and AAA sizes. Super pricing too."
"These appear to work better than Rayovacs. I only use Energizer/Duracell for smoke/CO2 detectors.In some kids toys, these have out performed Rayovacs, however, one sale, Rayovacs tend to be cheaper. I will continue to order these, especially out of convience, most likely on Subscribe and Save."
Good batteries. Can't beat the price!
great price
I usually only buy Duracell batteries that I purchase on sale through Groupon. I received a bad batch and it always takes so long to get them that I decided to give the Amazon batteries a try. I'll never buy another battery anywhere else. Thank you Amazon for providing another quality product that worked as well as the most expensive brands out there at a reduced price. Shipping was prompt and on time.
"Amazon Basics batteries are the best, I use them specifically in my Kwikset KEVO among other things. Certain items that were burning through batteries very quickly are now out of mind for 2 months +"
Well packaged with the full rated voltage and then some.
"I've gone through so many batteries with the BlinkforHome cameras, far more than they say it should. I've spent a fortune on big brand batteries and the lifespan was awful. Someone suggested I try AmazonBasics and so far I've only need four batteries in the time that I would have used 20 or more. When I use up the AAA size I have sitting around I'll get a box of those too in the AmazonBasics brand. These are superior to Duracell in every way."
"No joke, i was such a skeptic of these batteries. Seriously. But they seem more powerful than the name brand competition.I bought them for use in a breast pump mainly. I noticed with other batteries I was getting a lot less suction but with these it runs full power, just like I'd plugged it in the wall.I don't think I'll buy the name brand batteries anymore. Good job Amazon."
"Long lasting and a great value! Come in very basic packaging, most likely to cut cost. Will buy again!"
Seems to work better and last longer in our flashlights then the name brands!
tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands.
Longer lasting battery.
Had these in my wii for 2 weeks and the batteries leaked all over.
"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch."
"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!"
"Sorry to say these batteries leaked in a lighted mirror and ruined it. C'mon, Amazon!"
"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basics products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks. So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapper can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basics as they become available."
A good value but I'm still using them so don't know how long they will last. To be continued
"Super batteries, they last long. Package has so many units that I'm sharing with family and friends. If it's Amazon you know is good."
My family goes through a lot of AA and AAA batteries. I've been buying bulk packs of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries for a few years now and my household expenditures on batteries have gone down by nearly half. I don't see any difference in the overall performance or life of these batteries when compared to Duracell or EverReady alkaline batteries and they cost quite a bit less.
"These perform and last just as well as Energizer or Duracell. We burn through these at my office for wireless keyboards and mice, so I needed to restock at a good price. I've never had any complaints by anything made by AmazonBasics at all. These come in a simple cardboard box that's sealed. Inside that box, you have two rows of sealed/wrapped batteries. They worked great for my needs, and will return based on the price."
"So far so good, I'll try and let folks know if they don't last as long as branded batteries."
"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture."
"Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received"
Bought these for the holidays and I have to say I am impressed. I thought for the price I couldn't go wrong but these things hold their charge compared to any name brand. Kids have been running them in their toys non stop and they keep on going. I will definitely not hesitate to buy amazon batteries ever again.
"As advertised, a box of 36 AAA batteries. I have a bunch in my kitchen already, from when I bought a box (36) of Duracell AAA batteries last January. Well, I guess you can never have too many. A better deal here (Amazon) than the Duracell box, hope they perform as well too. Time will tell, have a great day."
"I'm no battery expert, but based upon using these in the same devices that I've used name brand batteries, I notice no difference in performance. Notably, when I used them in a recording wrist pulse oximeter, the amount of time that these lasted was identical to all other brands."
The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
Brand new and packaged inside box 4-in a row. Batteries last just as long if not more than name brand for much higher price.
Excellent idea to buy together!!
"These batteries have performed just as well as name brand batteries, and the price was very reasonable."
"I now have five times as many batteries as when I buy them at the grocery store, for the same price."
what a good deal on batteries they work well
I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.
"Simple packaging. No frills. It just works. These are standard batteries and will last as long as any others you'll find, but at a MUCH better price than any store will have."
Not the longest lasting. But good for the price.
"Don't last very long, but hey they are super cheap"
"I bought these batteries because I have had leakage problems with name branded batteries. These batteries were cheaperand seem to work well. I won't know if they leak until some time goes by,but I have had good luck with the unbrandedbatteries I purchased from Amazon in the past."
"I never use amazon batteries before,but I love it, It's good for the price,it last just as long as duracell batteries, and the design of the batteries is just cute"
"Pros: You can get a LOT of batteries for a very cheap price!Cons: Batteries do not last very long at ALL!I don't mind changing out batteries on something I use constantly since I got the hundred back, but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week. I bought these specifically for my XBox One controller which is used daily for an hour or two on average."
"For some reason, they are not working very well with my wireless mouse. Mouse pointer mover very slowly when I use these batteries, but it works fine when I use different batteries"
"Still evaluating, but just bought some more because they work well with my applications and their price is the best."
"Haven't use it, but looks good."
"I bought these mainly for my headphones I listen to tv with in bed at night to avoid disturbing my husband. Will last about a week in those. I sometimes forget to turn them off. Haven't timed them or anything, but no particular difference noted between these and higher priced brand name batteries--are noticeably better than some more inexpensive ones I have bought in a pinch. Also use in bathroom scales (weigh daily) and food scales (used daily), and last a long time. Love convenience of not running out of batteries frequently."
"Not sure how long these last yet, but seem fine so far. I like the box they come in that is strong, but then they put hard plastic wrap on 4 packs of the battery that are a pain to remove. Get out your knife, don't cut yourself."
"I was sick and tired of my duracells leaking so I bought these. Only one month in, so it's hard to know if they leak, but so far so good. No complaints."
"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these"
"They last nearly as long as name brand, but the price is amazing. Never buying other batteries again."
"Non name brand batteries usually freak me out a little, but these actually work pretty well. I drain batteries pretty fast, and so far these hold up like Duracell."
"Fast shipping. I haven't worn out one yet, so I dont know what their life will be, but they look good."
"Took awhile to get here, but they seem fine."
"Nothing really special, but they work just fine and aren't too expensive."
"I love Amazon. I am a prime member. Have had an amazon credit card for 16 years. Think their service and pricing is second to none.But.... these batteries are garbage. Gar-bage.They really don't work or at the very least don't work most of the time. Even when they do appear to work they only last like 1/4 of the time a normal AA would. Maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Yep.Portable defribrilator No.RC car Sure.Camera for younger sister's wedding in the Greek Isles Nope.Vibrating nose hair trimmer Ok.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Nyet.Get my drift... sure try them out, and keep trying them, like I have, but don't put any faith in them."
"These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-powered device!!!"
"This set of batteries exploded being stored in my garage, right next to a set of duracell. Duracell is fine."
great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it
These last about a week.
Great price! Batteries work great. I'm happy that I bought in bulk because I saved money and now I'm not constantly searching for batteries.
BUY THE BEST OR SUFFER LIKE THE REST
your basic batteries but cheaper. Did not notice shorter life span. Great for college
Not good. Don't last a week.
Awesome purchase. Last a pretty long time!
they are fresh batteries and work great
Great batteries for super price! I am on recurring shipment - get a box once a month.
Long lasting and great packaging. Rechargeable is best but these are good in a pinch.
Hands down better than the top brands. Thank you Amazon.
Always buy!
"Great value for the money. While I cannot compare this to any other batteries lifespan, they have been going for about a month strong now in frequently used devices."
love the little box it comes in and easy to open. works just like other batteries.
The ones that work work fine however I've just had to toss eight because they're dead. don't work. not happy
"These are wretched batteries. They typically last only two weeks in a TV remote control device, they can't power a computer's mouse beyond a week, and I have serious doubts about their shelf life. Packaging is nice, though, sort of like The Washington Post."
"Bad investment. Some of the batteries did not even work - no juice in them. Really surprised by the poor quality, Amazon Basics."
Terrible batteries!! They exploded all over my face. Received them on a Monday and that Sunday was having problems with my remote so I opened it up and was sprayed in the face with acid. Luckily it missed my eye. I have bought cheap batteries before and never had anything like this happen before!!
"From experience, the worst batteries I've ever purchased. Not sure if these were manufactured second hand but more than half of the pack died within ONE USE. As a new mom who depends on the quality and longevity of a good battery for her child's needs, I will never order this product ever again."
A real pleasure.
"When I think of all of the money that I've spent so far on batteries, I am actually a bit furious! I buy batteries for all sorts of things for my family. And to think, these batteries were here all along, and I should've bought them along time ago! Amazon basics batteries are definitely worth the buy! not only do you get the size that you need when you need it, you get enough in a simple package that meets the demands that you need, easier open, and, worth the price! For the same amount of batteries that you get even in the smaller package, you would pay quite a bit more for the larger more popular brands that are out there. These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Xbox controllers. Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Save option is great for monthly restocking or a staple item used all the time!"
I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!
Came in with a nice little package. And the batteries are high quality. I am using these for my string lights that are powered by batteries. Everything seems pretty good so far.
"These aren't the greatest batteries but they work. We've found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars. Anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them (like electric toy car motors) shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better. Some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these Amazon batteries on low draw electronics you'll get your money's worth.What I've found them good for: Keyboard, mouse, laser pointer, small LED flashlights, small noise making toys (plays music, electronic beeps)Not good for: Anything with an electric motor, toy cars, pencil sharpener, etc...They can be a good value depending on what you use them to power."
Only a good price when on sale. I can buy the same amount at Manards for 2 less not on sale
"Best Product Value , Amazon know what they doing (:Good price for quantity , for sure will buy more ."
These work just fine.
"There are too many kids toys to count in our house that require batteries. You cannot beat the price of Amazon branded batteries. They last just as long as any other top brand, but a much better value. AmazonBasics has quickly become a brand I trust."
Can't beat em. For the price and quality they are the best.
"You cannot beat the quality for the price of these batteries. For the same price as the cheapo brands, these AmazonBasics batteries are great quality. Nice weight to them compared to the cheap Sony or Sunbeam batteries. Performance wise they have been good so far and been using about a dozen of them for a month now."
"Honestly, they are AAA batteries. I had a keyboard that only takes AAA and don't have rechargeable ones. So far, haven't had an issue. Whether or not they last as long as name brand is yet to be seen. But the fact that I bought these already a few months ago and I'm currently typing on said keyboard with the first set I took from package tells me they should last long enough."
"High quality, long lasting, fast delivery. And a great price. Can't beat that! I recommend buying in bulk."
Not the longest lasting but the price more than makes up for it. We're big fans of the Amazon brand batteries in all sizes.
I've had these AA Amazon batteries for a month now and I've had no issues. I replaced the batteries in many of my sons toys when I first got them and all of the toys are still going strong.This pack of batteries comes with 48 AA batteries. It comes in a nice box which I'm still using to keep the unused ones in for storage. I think that the value of these are much better than any other brand. At Walmart for a 24 pack of energizer you will pay 9.94 and for a 24 pack of Duracell you will pay 13.97. This comes with double the amount! With a kid I've learned I can spend a fortune on batteries with all the toys that do not include batteries so I will continue to use these. Very happy with them so far!
Great price for a ton of batteries.
Good buy hands down
"Price per battery this is tough to beat. Performance/longevity wise, these beat out most every generic battery I've used and keeps up with the big brands too. You can't go wrong with these - especially if you have a household with kids ... kids have this magic that makes batteries deplete just by being around them .... lol"
Can't beat the value!
Great basic alkaline batteries at a terrific price.
Great quality batteries. For this many batteries you'd have to pay twice this price if it was name brand. This is a no brainer.
Excellent batteries for the price.
"Really excellent value here. They ship in a nice little box that's easy to store, within the box, the batteries are separated into plastic-wrapped packs of 4."
Nice affordable pack of batteries. I provide photos of what the packaging looks like.
can't say they are the best batteries in the market. but considering the price!!! Other batteries with the same price would be much worse than this brand.
"I use these for my son's Thomas and friends trains, and they didn't last very long. Maybe 2 days at the most. Won't be ordering these again."
"Cant beat the price, and these batteries seem to last forever even with heavy use. I grabbed this multi pack because you never know when you'll need AAA's and they've come in handy."
The power is yours!
"Got the juice, delivered right to the house, not a dud in the box."
Works for me however jury is still out on how long these wilol last.
Always provide enough power for the toys. We reorder them when we start getting low.
Great value on amazon basic batteries.
These batteries are top quality and you can't beat the price. If your in the market for batts then amazon basics are for you.
"This was an amazing deal very, very, very happy!"
Great price. Good Quality. No complaints.
Great option for all the little doo-dads and junk that doesn't need much power. I use these in TV remotes and such.
"What can I say. They are cheap and last as long as the copper top brand name. Don't waste your money on the brand, get the cheaper which is probably made by the brand anyways."
Cheap and functional. Can't ask for much more.
Cheap and good.
Cheap and convenient! Work great and last just as long as others!
These batteries worked perfectly and last pretty well. And they're cheap. Score!
"Probably should have rated these one star, but I didn't because I like Amazon as a whole. These batteries are soooo bad though! They were comparable to the Kirkland ones at Costco in price so I decided to switch things up and try these out. Huge mistake. These last half the life of Kirkland's. Not kidding. Not worth it. These are cheap!!!!!!!!"
I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.
Always worked well in my tools and controllers. Cheap. Dont forget to recycle
Cheap and Super convenient
Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.
The few batteries I have used so far work and are holding up. Will update if they fail prematurely
"I've been ordering these cheap batteries for years for my XBOX controllers. They are cheap and long lasting, and I'll never go back to picking up batteries at the store again."
cheap and work gritty good
"They're batteries. They're cheaper than Wal-Mart. What more could you want I don't have stats on whether they last longer than Duracell or Energizer, but at this price I don't think it really matters. The brand Amazon Basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more. It seems like Amazon wasn't enough of a household name so they're trying to make it so everything in your house has the Amazon name on it, but I ain't mad let them take over. I just wish they had an Amazon Basics brand for disposable diapers."
They're batteries..
"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them."
"They sure wore out quick! We normally go thru about a dozen AAA batteries in a year. We use them most for TV remotes and wireless mouses. But we replacing these every month. I was quite amazed at how quickly they were wearing out! I have a battery checker and once they hit yellow, they were done.Cheap batteries but I would not recommend nor will I buy again."
Seems decent as far as life of the batteries. Good enough to stock up on these for emergencies.
"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does."
"These run down in my TV remote quicker than any battery I have used. TV says low battery within a week of installing. I will try another brand next time. Amazon, please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically. They will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later."
Cheaper but still work well :)
Works just as well as any other batteries just much cheaper!
Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. Don't last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). This is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name.
still working fine
Product was worth the price and more
I spoil my cats rotten with toys. They burn through AA bats like a lonely middle aged woman. This is the cheapest way to get them. I just wish they didn't plastic wrap them in bundles of 4.
they don't last as long but they're cheap
"Cheap, long lasting batteries. Can't beat it."
"Great deal! These batteries last just as long as any other brand I've tried, and buying them in bulk is a great deal."
cheaper and better than branded
I always order amazon product. Cheaper and good quality
I'm very happy with these batteries. Cheaper than a local deal at a hardware store. They seem to work as well as the name brands. I'm happy with the quality and quantity.
Batteries seem to work just as well as name brand batteries but at a much cheaper price.
Just as great as name-brand batteries! The only difference seems to be the labels.
"I'll keep this relatively brief. I use rechargeable, mainly Eneloop batteries for almost everything. Every once in awhile though I have something that doesn't need the more expensive batteries or are exposed to rougher conditions like remotes or outside hose timers where I just want something disposable. These work well for that. I would buy them again"
Love the batteries! The duration of the batteries are pretty long and each one is created the same. Quality is good and above all else is the Price!Cheaper batteries if you buy the 100 pack and way way cheaper than costco!
The price is cheaper that the other famous brands. It works just as great as the other ones. Since when Amazon started selling their brand's battery I am a fan1 of it. I buy AA and AAA. I truly recommend this brand.
Very nice looking in picture and from a distance but the clock itself is cheaply made....The actual clock mechanism stopped working twice and doesn't work at all now.
"Real good, Worked as soon as I put them in. But made in China. not the USA. Trump 2016."
"These work just as well as the name-brands, come in easy to access packaging, and are a great value! Will never buy batteries from a big box store again!"
Comes in a box that is convenient for storing. High quality batteries and not high quality prices.
"The positive cap is just a little shorter than it's supposed to be. That means battery holders which have shoulders built into them, the positive terminal doesn't touch the contact. The Chinese find creative ways to cut corners to achieve the desired price point of the customer. They do not sacrifice profit...they sacrifice quality...they sacrifice quantity and they sacrifice material. Thanks China!"
Comparable in quality to the more expensive brands. No issues so far with the quality of this batteries. I will buy again.
"I've used Amazon batteries for a couple of years in everything from remotes, toys, flashlights, noise cancelling headsets, and portable games and have been very pleased. They have not let me down yet. The performance is comparable to what you get out of the leading major brands at a fraction of the price. You can save even more if you add these to your Subscribe Save items! You can't beet the price! I highly recommend them!"
These batteries held up about as well as dollar store batteries. Very disappointed in quality.
First time user seems comparable to EverReady
"I am a big fan of Amazon batteries! They cost less, last as long, and get here in 2 days with Prime!"
I've used 4 of these batteries now and the life appears to be comparable with that of Duracell/Energizer. The cost savings over the mainstream brands makes these a real winner! Would buy again.
Lasts just as long as Duracell.
Compared to dollar store like batteries these seem to be better but not like twice as good. For the price and quantity it's worth the purchase.Use them in tv remotes to chess computers to kids toys and can't complain. Amazing how many items require AA batteries today.
Great price. Compares well to major brands
Does the job. Seems to have good life. One complaint is that the batteries are in sealed groups of 4 which complicates opening them. A simple box of 48 loose would be much easier to deal with.
"OK for general use, fairly cheap, esp compared to lithium. Consumer Reports lists Kirkland from Cosco as better performers and about the same price. I'm gonna try them next. Of course being delivered to your door in a hurry is always great."
"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand"
Something as simple as a pack of batteries brought to you by Amazon at a more than competitive price delivered to your door. How could you go wrong
I like how easy and fast it is to order these batteries. This is a really good price for the convenience aspect.
great price and now I have them on hand whenever I may need a battery!
"Well, I've only used 3 of these for about an hour but they are lovely so far."
"This battery pack is economical, and the convenience of having it delivered is a plus."
Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage. Perfect for those toys (child and adult toys) that are constantly using batteries. I wish Amazon offered a package with prepaid return postage for recycling. I would pay an extra dollar or something if I could pack them back in the box and ship them back to Amazon for recycling. YOU HEAR THAT AMAZON
"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store"
"They're batteries, what more do I need to say"
Stopped working in less than 3 months.
Batteries work as good as any other big brand
So far these batteries perform as well as any other alkaline battery that I have used. The cost even beats Duracell at Costco so I consider it a good deal.
It seems to work as good as Brand name batteries!
Do not last as long as costco/kirkland equivalents.
"These batteries seem to not last as long as other batteries I have used. They feel like they're made of good material, but they don't last as long as I would like them to."
couldn't be happier. They work great and appear to have a long life.
Amazon Basics. That's all that needs to be said:)
These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.
"Love this when I'm doing my makeup. it was a lot larger than I expected which I really loved! The only con I found is that it is TOO BRIGHT. When I first used it, my eyes and head hurt because of the brightness. But overall, this is a great product."
"Crazy cheap. They last about as long as name brand batteries in my Xbox controllers, TV remote, and my expansive AmazonBasics adult toy collection. What more needs to be said"
"DO NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaked in a machine I was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the projector up, it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the projector.The batteries were new, stored at room temp, used at room temp, not recharged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon's resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I'll order batteries from you again. Just not your brand..."
"If you, like me, dont care what batteries you use in your TV remote these are fine for youPros-Um 100 batteriesThey come in packs of 4, so not loose batteries rolling aroundCons-I hear they may drain quicker than more expensive batteries. To that I say: I have 99 more where that came from."
Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.
"With four kids under the roof, their toys are always in need of AA batteries. I had purchased this AmazonBasics pack of AA batteries for exactly that purpose. The expiration year reads 2024, but after just two years of sitting on the shelf, the batteries that are left are all but dead. They weren't left in cold storage to freeze, they were right on the shelf in our living room. I ended-up going to Radio Shack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use. It's really sad that they just can't hold their own after only two years. Will stick with known brands from now on."
Bought a box of 36 aaa batteries and all batteries were dead. Don't waste your money. The only way I rated it 1one star is because it would not except ZERO stars which is what this product deserves.
None of these batteries had a full charge. My charge detector never reached the green zone. They were one half used up. This was true for the other two sizes D and AAA.
All the batteries came dead. None of them worked. Don't bother buying these.
"I got two of these batteries with my Fire TV stick. Loaded them in and everything was good for 1.5 days. Then the Fire TV stick stopped responding. I trouble shooted with no fix. Called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too, started by saying can you change the batteries.... my response ... seriously, you want me to change the batteries, it's a freaking TV stick what could possibly be wrong, the batteries are brand new and came with the device. So I was changing the batteries as I was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem. So.... these amazon batteries died in 1.5 days. How does that happen"
It's seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead. They are only lasting 3-4 days in the devices I'm putting them in. Fairly disappointed
"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window."
Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.
"The batteries were not operable out of the package. Thought it was the appliance, but replaced with other batteries and it worked fine. Luckily, Amazon's return policy is amazing but I doubt I'll try another one of their Basics brand items anytime soon."
Perfect
"These batteries don't last as long as the top brands, but for the price I can't complain too much."
"These work pretty well. They don't seem to last quite as long as Duracell or Energizer, but for the price I will continue to buy."
decent batteries. doesnt seem to last as long as better brands. use it for xbox 1 controller.
decent batteries. ok life.
"Decent batteries for a great price, idk if they last as long as energizer but so far so good, I will order more for Christmas for sure."
"It's now about the middle of April and I bought these at the end of February, I waited to post my review so I could get a better feel for these and how they last and how they compare to other batteries I've been using.We use a lot of batteries in our house so I buy bulk and these seemed like a good deal and they were or are.These seem to last just as long as other batteries I've used in terms of usage time so no complaints there at all. I'm happy with them for sure, will purchase again as needed."
Decent batteries
"They don't last that long but, since you get so many, it doesn't matter that much."
"Amazon Batteries! They got me on the price, but how's the performance! Honestly I can't tell cause who's counting I usually by pro cells because Sometimes I'm a pro. Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available. These really aren't that bad. Pro TIP: Make sure you dispose them properly so you don't kill the earth. I'd definitely buy these again. Now that I am a father, there's all kinda of other things to put batteries in. Also do not skimp out on your earthquake kit. It sounds like whatever but honestly you need to prepare folks!"
"I bought these solely based on price. (Might have even been a Prime Day special, I'm not positive at this point)Use them in remotes, my camera flash, and a few flashlights. I think they work just fine and last an appropriate amount of time. If it seems they were used up quickly, I just think about the price I paid and have no issues."
These are okay by me.
Seems to have lifespan of other name brand batteries. Happy with them
They dont last as long as certain premium brands but they do OK. I wouldnt put them in critical apps like smoke detectors but for TV remotes and toys and all the other goofy modern distractions that regularly beg for AAs they are OK.
"They're a decent value for the amount of batteries (especially on Prime Day) you get. I use them mainly in remotes around the house and other devices, and I haven't had any issues with them leaking. They do drain a little faster than Duracell coppertops, but these are a far better value when caught on sale. I've used both the AA and AAA and they're both decent."
"Not the best, not the worst. Less life than some batteries but price is right."
So far hasn't been bad but there have been a few batteries with really low life span.
Decided to try these private labeled batteries and they work excellently. I have already purchased more of a different size.
Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast.
"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life."
"Defective! All Amazon batteries I tried over the past year have been defectlve. Most too short. I have to constantly pull the spring, if the device has the spring, and roll the battery around to get it to work again. These are new batteries. Many of the batteries were thrown away because we thought they had been used up. It wasn't until recently that we realized it was all the Amazon batteries that were causing the problem. I was on the phone with Amazon for two hours yesterday trying to get these orders straighten that out. I still have no confirmation that I do not have to send the batteries back because many went into the trash."
"I am now trying to use the batteries and basically they are not working. Perhaps they are old, but they are just plain not working. I put in a Duracell and my headphones work. I put any one of the 36 batteries in the headphones - and it is not working. It is not worth the effort to get my 10 back."
The price is fantastic and they work just as well as certain name brand batteries with the copper top and the bunny.
"AAA batteries. They make things go. I, uh...I have nothing else. I mean, batteries are pretty much--Oh, wait! They're quite shiny also."
I'll never buy Dollar Store batteries again! D They're great. I'd put them on par with Energizer or Duracell.
You can not beat the price and it is by a trusted name.
"Great product at a great price! I have been using these alongside the more name-brand batteries, and so far they are still neck and neck! I'm always looking for a quality product at a great price, and I really feel like these have the longevity to do that. I'm very pleased, and we will be buying Amazon batteries as our household battery moving forward."
Good value and dependable
"These batteries are usually a good buy for the money. I have had leakage on one occasion and dead cells a couple of times, but overall I have been satisfied. I think these batteries are as good as any other on the market."
"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. ."
Batteries dead as of June 1. I did not use half of then. Good for 6 months.
"We used in an August smart lock. We expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energizer batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks."
DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!
I bought these for remotes in my home. I'm constantly having to change them and sometimes the brand new batteries don't work.
"I used these in wireless microphones in church. They didn't last as long as I expected. Actually, rechargeable batteries do nearly as well."
Ive gone thru half the box. Everyone of these batteries lasted for about 10 minutes and then died. Not happy at all! Wasted money on something i needed.
"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand."
"These batteries die out a lot faster than the Duracell batteries we normally purchase. Yes, they are cheaper, but unfortunately more batteries are ending up in the landfills because we are going through these too fast."
"They didn't last long, do not waste your money!! Die quickly, most of them didn't even work out of the package!!"
"Hi ordered these thinking they were a great price, but sadly they die very quickly."
these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.
these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.
run out super quick! would not buy again
"Holds basically a 30 minute steady usage charge and dies. We used these in microphones, and they died within the 30-40 minute range, fully charged.It also seems that the older they get, the longer it takes to charge and the faster they die out. Not very reliable, unfortunately."
Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.
Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted.
Do not hold charge as well as major brands.
Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it
"I love Amazon, but these aren't at the same level as the big brands. I use them in some monitoring devices in my home. Typically I would need to change these every 3 months, but these are lasting about 6-7 weeks at best. They're ok, but just don't have the life expectancy I need."
these batteries are terrible very disappointed. i have purchased before great long lasting very powerful. i must have received a bad batch they don't last very long. i may not purchase again.
"Worked for one day, then stopped working. Can't tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn't register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend."
Disappointed with this product. Used them for led candles and had to wiggle them around to get them to work. At the same time I also purchase ACDelco Batteries because Amazon would only allow the purchase of one box. I'm glad I did because the ACDelco batteries worked great! I would not purchase AmazonBasics batteries again.
Batteries are notably less long-lived compared to other brands. Disappointed!
The price was right but they just don't last as long as the other name brand batteries so it's not worth it.
Sadly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I've had to change them out many times.
"These batteries literally only last 15 minutes inside of each device I put them in. When I researched the product, they told me the only way was to spend 50 on the recharger for these batteries. I personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what I spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to recharge them. Worst amazon product I ever wasted my money on"
"These batteries were a huge disappointment. I used two in my amazon tv remote and they lasted only 2 weeks. Usually, I only need to change batteries in that remote every 3-4 months or so. Total ripoff."
"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time."
"For some reason, these just haven't held a charge the way the Duracells I've used the past do. I've used these in those small-wired-LED lights you can use for decorations. Those lights take 3 AA batteries and while the old Duracells I've used lasted several months on a 4-hour on, 16 hour-off timer, these are lasting just a few weeks."
These batteries are not lasting at all.... very short life on them... super disappointed...
Batteries don't last that long I bought these for some of the little round lights that go in your closets or under your cabinets they didn't make it a week which was sad.
Spend a few more dollars and get a branded one. These discharge very fast. Had to keep changing my wall clock battery every 2 months when I had these. Got an energizer battery and that stayed for more than a year. Didn't expect amazon product to be of such poor quality.
Bought several times and they last
Great Batteries. Cost and shipping was well worth it.
"DO NOT BUY. All batteries arrived completely dead. I thought it might be a bad batch. Ordered more, all arrived dead."
"I only have it one star because I couldn't give zero stars. Over half of the box were dead. The ones that did work, only worked for a very short time. Do not buy these batteries."
They didn't work. Took one from each pack and - nothing!
"Went to pit them on for the first time and the strap behind the buckle broke. Never even got to wear them. Poor construction, cheaply made product."
You get what you pay for.Lucky to get 2 weeks of minimum use.
They went Dead before even using them.. The ones i used lasted maybe 4hours at best !!!
Might as well be dead on arrival. Already burned through two sets of 4 of these since I ordered them less than two months ago on a Schlage keypad deadbolt lock. The previous batteries lasted over a year. I'll never order another Amazon basics battery.
"Purchased these 3 months ago in addition to a higher end () brand that came with a 9 docket charger. The higher end rechargeables are still going strong. These leaked battery acid all over my charger and ruined one docket, and ruined an under cabinet puck light. Save your money! They won't last!"
Bought these batteries thinking they were a good price. I have two deodorizer devices that spray a tiny amount every :20 minutes. I put these batteries in one and a brand name in the other. The name brand batteries have not been changed yet ant these batteries have gone through 4 pairs. Name brand are cheaper in the long run
"Do not have issues with their batteries and definitely cheaper than the regular store, the only other store that compares is Ikea."
I don't understand why these are rated so highly - these batteries DO NOT LAST. I have never experienced batteries that died so quickly....I used them from everything to my computer mouse to microphone and they lasted maybe about 1/4 the time of what I'm used to. I guess you get what you pay for - would never order these again
They do not last long at all. I have to keep changing them out on the products I put them in. Will not be buying them again.
batteries last a fraction of the time that most of the other well known battery brands do
I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend.
They do not work. I had to buy Duracell
These batteries started leaking right out of the box.I threw them in the trash and went back to Duracell.
Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables
"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my joule thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.This may sound dorky-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remotes, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be powered."
DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :(
I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.
Literally the worst battery I've ever had. I've used them in different types of products and they are DEAD WITHIN A WEEK every time. Go to the dollar tree and save yourself some money and a headache
So far so good. Let's see how they hold up over time. Hope they hold their charge and don't leak.
They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.
Does not last. Very short life span.
Batteries last a decent amount for things like toys and remotes. The packages come 4 each in a plastic wrap so you don't have to worry about loose batteries floating around after you open the box.
"I didn't conduct an official experiment, but they seem to work just as good as any other batteries out there. Perfect!"
Does the job. Very good price!
good price good batteries
These are batteries so what can one say. ...they are economical and function. I bought light motion that require 3 AAA batteries. I needed 9 and they all work flawlessly. Plus now my remote control also works too.
After one use in a regular used battery powered item it's dead. With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery.
I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months.
These die SO fast.
"Put these batteries in led string lights on two wreaths, place kirkland batteries in another set of the same lights....guess what Amazon batteries loose their power quickly. Kirkland batteries are still flashing strong,,,,,,Amazon batteries barely blink. Sorry Amazon, love you but not these for me."
doesn't work with everything. baby toys good. electronics not so much
It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse
Works for the purpose purchased.
Great value. Keep the power just the same as the much higher priced Duracell and Energizer batteries
"Haven't noticed any difference in performance since I switch from my (brand name), big difference in price though. I will be ordering these from now on."
These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are powering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant.
Didn't have hardly any charge to them. A total waste of money.
These batteries don't even work in a Amazon Firestick!
"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results."
Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well.
"Worst batteries for photographers. I'm sure they might be fine for using around the house, but for what I purchased them for (using with my external flash) these are the worst batteries I've ever used.Won't purchase them again.The black ones that are supposed to be better are also horrible for photographers.Household use only."
"Never put a review online about a purchase , but this Amazon battery leak so badly I have to discard all of them after 2 weeks of use, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM ...."
"These are, by, far, the worst batteries my family has ever purchased. They have all lasted less than one week and I've only used them in things that see usage a few times per week. None of them have seen more than 10 min total usage before needing replaced and q about a third of them have leaked or corroded worthiness a few days. I've had much better luck with dollar store brands."
"I use it for the roku remote and it runs out so fast, holds for about 2-3 weeks (just like the chineese batteries),"
"You get what you pay for here. These are cheap batteries and don't last very long, I'd spend the extra and get rechargeables."
I put two of these in my small flashlight and they only lasted about 15 minutes. Waste of money.
Don't hold a charge as long as other comparable batteries
"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use."
"Don't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!"
Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name brands. My hope was to power Christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks. Many of these batteries did not make it. In the future I will stick with proven brands.
"Terrible. Don't hold their charge, I change the batteries in my remote once a week. Will not be buying again."
These are terrible. Don't last Put then in various items and their life is only 1/2 half of a Duracell
"These have failed after a few weeks each time I've used them in my wireless keyboard. Duracells, on the other hand, have lasted for months."
I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. We will continue to buy them though because of the price.
"This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train."
I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.
Batteries do not last at all. Worth just getting energizer batteries instead.
"After using two sets of these, I am going to agree with other reviewers and say that they don't last as long as name brand batteries."
"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock."
These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.
"These batteries don't last. They might be a good value but for me it's more important to have a battery that lasts longer. Or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if I have a flat tire. If you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands Duracell, energizer etc. If you just want something that's cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but I bought the 60 count Duracell batteries for .36 each. I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell's last more than a third longer."
Don't look further for any other brand. You get double the amount of batteries for the same price compared to other brands. The battery life is comparable to the other name brands. Must have for every household.
long lasting/good price
They lasted less than 24 hours in my mouse and that includes turning the mouse off overnight! What a ripoff.
"I bought these batteries to charge my insulin pump - a life critical device. After I started using them, I found my pump worked terribly and after testing all other variables, popped out the Amazon battery and replaced with a Duracell, and everything was back to normal. I won't use these again."
"Great value for batteries in bulk - our household expends batteries quickly, so it's great to always have a backup supply.The low cost of these means I can afford to keep plenty on hand. The quality is comparable to most other brands we've tried - especially for video game controllers and the like."
"I am very disappointed in these. I put them in my remote and within 24 hrs they are completely dead. For shame, Amazon. For shame."
I'm never going to buy a brand-name battery again . Amazon basic batteries are just as good as the big boys . Amazon basic batteries are my battery of choice from now on .
"Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detectors. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product."
"I use a lot of batteries for lighted decorations all year round. I tried these out during Halloween. They were the worst. I tested them against Sams Club batteries, Harbor Freight Tools batteries and duracell. The amazon always died first. They even leaked that battery acid out after a few hours of use. Just horrible. I removed these from my subscribe and save list. I won't buy again."
These are horrible! Don't waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I've ever tried. A few hours in a Wii remote and they have to be replaced. I'm so disappointed!
The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.
"I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money."
they dont last long at all not worth buying
A Great Deal On Great Batteries.
dont last as long as I expected them to. they are in our fire stick remotes and i have to change them about every 2 or 3 months
"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them"
Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.
"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible"
"Exactly what I needed, lots of AA batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on."
These batteries don't last!!!!
All but about 4 were duds. What a waste of money.
Not very long lasting batteries....
I was surprised to see how inexpensive these batteries were and packaged nice
"These batteries are HYPED! Duracell always wins. I bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and I can clearly see how they fail against Duracell AAA batteries. I also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots. Under standard conditions doesn't matter, batteries need to perform the way consumers use them. To be fair, these batteries are better but don't show them as the best in the world, no way!"
"Considering that Duracell batteries are guaranteed to leak and ruin your device, these are an excellent alternative."
"Bought these in late Nov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package."
"Works well, easy packaging"
"Batteries for days, easy and cheap. If they simply work, I'll be all good. The packaging is shiny, so they will, right :)"
"The Internet of Things... more like, Internet of Batteries! The more smart gear we get, the more batteries we blow through. When my wifi-enabled scale (!) pooped out after about 9 months on the factory batteries, I restocked it with the Amazon Basics. They ship in a compact, no-frills cardboard box... inside a larger Amazon shipping box. The cardboard box is easy to open... no screwing around with scissors and sharp plastic packaging. Then you can close the lid on them when done and not worry about them rolling everywhere. If you have shaky hands or poor eyesight, these are the ones to get."
"Arrived quickly. Easy to install with clear, simple instructions. Touch screen input seems to be the same as it was prior to installation."
Works as well as the name brand batteries but so much cheaper! Easy to unpack also.
Plug and play! Easy to use.
Would highly recommend. Much cheaper than traditional clam-shell battery packs in store and seem to have a decent shelf life.
We are pleased with these AAA batteries. They are economical and have worked well for us in the items we tried them with. Easy to store in the cardboard box they arrived in.
Just as good as the more expensive name brands.
Does not last as long as name brands such as Duracell and Energizer.
"Cheap and effective, These batteries last a reasonable amount of time for the price"
Such a great deal on efficient batteries. My kids use batteries like crazy on their leap pads . I've tried several store brands and big brand names. These last as well as a Duracell and we're so much better priced.
"I gave one star because they were batteries and did not explode in my face which is a major plus. However, if you need batteries for anything you use on a daily basis outside a tv remote then do not buy. These batteries do not last as long as duracell or energizer by far, and i wish i was getting paid to say that. Spend the extra dollars and buy a better battery."
"Just enough batteries to fill all the remotes and have a few in reserve.And, hey, it's Amazon - you can't beat the price."
Dynamic Strong Battery.
"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! We have lots of frameless candles, so these are great"
It's a whole crap load of Aa batteries. They make electricity happen. It's magic
Their batteries
If your looking for batteries of the future that are environmentally safe you need only look for NiZn batteries they put out more power and last much longer and are rechargeable. AGAIN THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTALY SAFE. Check out 1.6volt batteries NiZn.. much better battery then anything out there.!! DO your customers a favor and bring them up to date with new technology.. FACT!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND USE A MUCH BETTER BATTERY NiZn
"These work as well as any big name brand batteries. I'm a heavy pc user since I work from home and I use a wireless mouse with my laptop. I can get weeks of use out of these without an issue. And even when the low battery light starts flashing on the mouse, I still get 2-3 days use out of them. Save your money, and buy these instead."
"Why people buy batteries at the store any more is beyond me. The price on these can't be beat and they last as long as the name brand batteries. Even better they show up at your door, leaving you do spend time doing things you want to do."
"Blown away by the affordability of these batteries. Even if they're slightly subpar in length of useful life, it's STILL a killer deal."
Even though there not bans brand batteries they last a while use two out of the pack and it's still going for about a month
Every battery had a voltage reading between 1.61 and 1.66v. Will update if the lifespan of these batteries is less than expected.
Ok people. Everyone knows how it is when you've run out of double A's. I added these to my subscribesave. They seem to last a fair amount of time (even in the game boy!). Every household needs a good stache of double A's hidden somewhere. The price is vey affordable too. Great buy.
"batteries.. everybody need them.. these are everybit as good as duracell for half the price, better than energizer .... very satisfied I use them for professional audio and photography..."
"Everyone discusses the pros and cons of batteries. They lasted 1.2 hours less than brand A or .34 hours longer than brand B.Whatever. They're necessary. They're cheaper than some, more expensive than some. if you're buying 300 batteries a week.......Blah blah..... I have these in my flashlights. I have lots of flashlights. I don't have to go to the store. More than enough for a positive rating."
Proper sized (unlike generic batteries) with lots of power.
These batteries are sooo much cheaper than the name brands and function the exact same. I use a lot of batteries with my Xbox controller and saw no difference in battery life between these and name brands. Will absolutely buy more in the future
Exactly as described. I'll learn if they last or not.
Wonderful batteries! These batteries are great and last a long time.
Excelent
A great product! Why pay more for batteries when these work just fine and are cheap! Thanks Amazon!
Excellent
Excellent
Excellent
Excellent - not sure why I would ever pay more for batteries.
Excellent batteries. Can't complain! A lot cheaper than any other brands and you get the same good quality. Amazon doesn't disappoint.
"Excellent set of batteries, very affordable, and comes with a nice packaging. I won't be buying batteries from retail stores anymore."
"Great batteries and great price. Thanks Amazon (and by the way, if you're listening, please make an entire Amazon Basics store so Prime Members can shop in there exclusively)."
Great price for batteries with exceptional performance and life.
"i now use AA and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name brands."
The price is unbeatable! Never buying batteries at CVS agaun
These Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the expensive name brand. I'll be buying these from now on.
"Unbeatable for the price. Haven't tested in depth, but seem to last just as long as any name brand AA's."
Excellent for the price. I usually buy Duracell for the guys and their video game controllers -- these last just as long and saved us some .. came in a box that was great for storage and batteries were also vacuum packed by 4's inside the cardboard box. Will buy again
This is an excellent phone case. Five star sleek look and perfect fit.
Satisfied will reorder
"They work great and come in excellent packaging!I can't vouch for their lifespan vs the big brands, since I haven't paid attention to how long my old batteries would last. It's at least comparable! Comparable enough that the discount on AmazonBasics batteries is definitely worthwhile!"
Excellent Batteries
"Good Price, excellent packaging, and the batteries last a long time in comparison with other brand batteries I have tried that only came with four in the pack for the same price! Will order these from now on from Amazon!!"
"Great batteries, great price!!"
Great price and lasts just as long as leading brands of batteries.
Great product for its value. Amazon isn't doing things just because Amazon does things because they are needed by customers and this is just small example of that.
I shouldn't be since it's amazon. But there as good as name brands. I'll buy from now on. Save unselfish money
"Put 4 of these in my handheld scanner 2 weeks ago, still going strong. I normally leave it on between 1 to 3 hours at a time. To say I'm beyond impressed is an understatement. Out of normal alkaline batteries, I was getting at best 2 or 3 days."
Superior to Dura C batteries. I compared new batteries of each brand in the same flashlight. Amazon batteries were brighter.
These are done long lasting batteries. They work great
These batteries work great!!!
Works as described
You can never have too many batteries. These last a long time.
"These batteries are most likely made by a third party with some experience in manufacturing private label. They are well made, lasts long (cannot tell significant difference between these and the brand name ones). I also like the convenience of having them shipped to me as I don't relish shopping for batteries at physical stores. Made in Indonesia."
"Throw away all my generic batteries and replaced with these. 48-Pack came in a nice carton box with 4-pcs. battery in each plastic wrap. Used in remote controllers, game controllers, mouse, automatic spray air fresheners, LED flashlights and camping lanterns, clocks, wall lamps, and other devices. Excellent batteries for the price."
EXCELLENT BATTERIES FOR THE PRICE.
Excellent batteries with a long shelf-life.
"Excellent batteries, at a good price."
"As good as any of the big name brands. Only complaint is the very difficult to remove plastic from each group of four batteries. I appreciate that Amazon is concerned with reducing package size, but wrapping them in plastic isn't working for me. Would have been much better to use a small band to keep them together since they are in a tight cardboard box, it is unlikely they will short each other out, the band probably isn't even needed."
Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extras on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.
"These work great. Inexpensive, and from a name you can trust!"
Excellent batteries! Last just as long if not longer than the name brands. These are what I'll be purchasing from now on.
"I needed AAA batteries and it's going to be a while before I get to Costco to get some. I was buying something else on Amazon and decided to get some batteries, to give it a chance. They arrived in 2 days, they were well packaged and sealed, and most importantly, they work great, they hold a charge well, I am very pleased. Excellent batteries."
They're definitely good batteries! What a bargain. I recommend this if you have a lot of AAA toys.
AA batteries- good quality can't beat the value.
Excellent batteries. Long lasting in small MP3 player.
"using them in our trail cam, excellent battery life"
"These are your standard AA batteries that are very similar to most other AA batteries you will find at most stores. The energy output is quite similar however the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store. For that reason I really like using these batteries from Amazon Basics. They are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap battery.Dimensions and close-ups can be seen in the photos I have attached to the review.Included in this set are 48 batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of 4.Pros:*Good amount of power output*Last an acceptable amount of time*Awesome priceCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:These batteries are not rechargeable. They are one-time use. If you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhere.Overall: 5/5 stars (.5 rounds up, .5 rounds down) 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
These work just as well as the top battery brands.
"Excellent cells for the price range. From what I see, they are as good as Duracells and that is all I ever used to use.The packaging is amazing. Only in China can they still pack in cardboard boxes that surround the package like this.I am not doing any testing, other than use in low powered items like wireless mice, keyboards, wall clocks and the like. That's all I need them for. These cells meet those requirements and that's all I care about. For high volume stuff I use NiMHs, but you just can't beat the price. I am finding that many of the Amazon basics products are a hit. I have bought several things and all have worked just as good or better than the higher priced competition. Good job Amazon."
Great value
Worth the money. Used these batteries while camping for two weeks and they are still working great. They will probably be used at home or used again next year during our camping adventure.
Best deal I have found!
"Excellent batteries, I couldn't believe how inexpensive they were. I will continue to purchase Amazon batteries from now on. I use these in my video gaming controller daily and they last for a long time. Very happy that I purchased these and would recommend to anyone!"
"Nice and fresh, dated 10 years out! I use these in everything, should last a long time."
Excellent item! Works great and is exactly as pictured in the description
"I've used these as a replacement for the nearly double in price of Duracell batteries. These last just as long as the Duracell batteries - a minute or two does not make a difference as my devices are on 24/7 - especially when these batteries are half the price! I have not had any leak, whether they were in their package or in any devices. The expiration dates on every shipment I've had so far have averaged 9 years with some 10 years from when I received them. This means they are fresh (recently made) and haven't been sitting around on a warehouse shelf for long. I like the green circular negative (-) indicator with the check mark (tick) on the side. Makes for quick installation in poor light. Excellent value and excellent performance!"
"Excellent power and price. You can't beat this deal on high quality batteries. Even the club warehouse prices for their own store brands are more expensive than these.They provide more than adequate power for everything we've used them for.They work very good for small flashlights too.Seriously. You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere."
"Like most people I use tons of batteries. The super high price and hassle of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basics' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other brands. So instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name brands)."
WORK GREAT
"Excellent price and they last for a long time. Have not had one leak either, like the other brand I use to use."
"I haven't tested the duration of the power from the battery, but the price, quality of shipping, quality it of the batteries are Excellent."
"I have used inexpensive dollar store batteries in the past. I became curious about the actual performance data of cheap vs. name brand batteries, and discovered that essentially you pay approximately the same amount per unit of power, regardless of battery (with the exception of lithium ion which cost more per unit of power). Also, I noticed that the cheap batteries did not work as well as name brand with my automatic wine bottle opener. So, if I am going to pay the same amount of unit power per battery, why not get the ones I have to change the leastI was pleasantly surprised to find these amazon basics batteries at a cost per battery that is significantly lower than name brands, but with similar performance characteristics as the name brands. Assuming the marketing information is accurate, these batteries should last a long time, and not cost much. This is an ideal combination in my opinion."
"Excellent price, and they are long-lasting batteries. I have no interest in purchasing batteries from anywhere else from now on."
"Good price, good quality and shipping time much less expensive than at the local drugstore. will buy again.."
"Excellent batteries, work well, price is right. Cannot tell difference between these and the name brand."
EXCELLENT PRODUCT
this is a Excellent Productis everything as expectedfits all the i need from a product like this one
"My husband uses these batteries in his insulin pump. He was buying expensive brand name batteries because he thought they would last longer. I ordered these AmazonBasics for him and it is a great buy. As far as lasting, they last as long, if not longer, than the name brand batteries. I would say to anyone who is thinking of getting these batteries, you will not go wrong with them. Try them and see what you think. This is the battery we will be buying from now on."
Fresh batteries with excellent shelf life and in use duration -- superb price
Excellent product for the price
"EXCELLENT PRODUCT,GREAT QUALITY AND VALUE"
"Excellent product!!! Last long, no problems."
"Excellent purchase, especially for the price. 2 toddlers in the house make batteries a commodity item. There are excellent reviews that compare AmazonBasics to the usual battery brands. I highly suggest you read them to see that there really isn't a difference and since the price is so much lower these are a no brainer."
Excellent quality
Tested and performed as good or better than the leading brands. I have many Amazon Basic products from micro USB chargers to HDMI cables and all are excellent quality. You would be crazy not to buy these. Amazon for President
"I've been using these batteries for awhile now, and I'm very happy with their performance. The quality and the price are top notch!"
These batteries work just as well as the name brand batteries at the fraction of the cost. This battery pack bundle is reasonably priced and last very long. I purchased the triple AAA battery bundle as well because of how well these performed.
"This is the 2nd time I've ordered these batteries. They work every bit as well as the big name brands, and for the price, you can't beat the value. I will continue to use AmazonBasics batteries in my house- I cannot recommend them enough!"
These work just as well as any other brand and here I am several months later with a nice stock of batteries. The price/value of this pack cannot be beat.
These really do last a long time. I have bought them more than once and will again. Definitely recommend.
"These AmazonBasics AA batteries are a phenomenal value for the quality you get! The batteries last quite a long time and they're well worth the price you pay.We go through batteries at my house like they're going out of style, so finding a bulk amount for a reasonable price was a bit difficult. These batteries solved my problem with that. It was a great purchase, and I recommend them for you folks out there that go through batteries quickly. You'll find that to not be the case with these."
"I find these batteries are reliable and work consistently to satisfaction. I use them in remote controls, thermometers, alarms and wireless devices. I will continue to buy these batteries."
"excellent value, seem to be excellent batteries and extra leak protection makes them even better, I will buy more"
These work perfectly in every application I've needed them for. They have so far lasted just as long as the copper tops I usually buy at a significant price savings.
Why buy batteris at the drug or grocery store for relatively high prices when to can get large amounts more cheaply Thesed are nicely priced and as good as any national brand!
"Good batteries, i got a 20 pack of the AA batteries. Batteries indicate good through date of 2026!Good life, bright in flashlights also. I will purchase these again, i consider them an excellent value and a great buy!"
Great value product!
"With some reservations these appear to be excellent batteries. I replaced some Duracell batteries in several LED flashlights with these and the light was much brighter with Amazon batteries (side by side testing, two identical flashlights). I am impressed. On the down side, the date (I supposed expiration date of shelf life) is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. It is very readable on Duracell batteries. These were 2025 dated, so obviously they are 10 years out, and that's very good, will surely use them up long before then. The packaging is simple, but more or less necessitates a container to store them as they will just fall all over the drawer once opened. In hard to read print on the batteries it says made in Indonesia. Not Japan as some reviews had thought might be the country of origin. BTW -- the Duracells AAA's I removed from my flashlight leaked badly and ruined the (expensive) flashlight. Therefore I am sticking with Amazon batteries for now."
Excellent...
This is a great deal and I will certainly order again!
Good price. Haven't thoroughly tested yet. I like the NO LEAK reviewd
Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other brands
I cannot believe what a great deal these are!!! These work just as well as any other name brand battery. I have a two-year-old and therefore we go through a LOT of batteries for his toys. I will never buy any other battery again!!!
facemask
"These are fair batteries. They are fine for most toys, etc. but they don't seem to last as long as Duracell or Energizer batteries. And I've found some of the packs to be hit or miss. I've had a few packs with several of the batteries already nearly drained straight out of the package."
I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs. Didn't realize they were regular batteries until they arrived. I was a little annoyed. I blame Amazon for showing me these when I was looking for something else.
"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels."
Fantastic batteries for a fantastic price! High quality. Shipping was super fast as I received them the next day after ordering. Happy customer
"Five stars.They all worked, there were lots of them, and they didn't cost a lot.I like that they are packaged four per set in the big box, so there weren't just batteries EVERYWHERE!"
"I didn't even know amazon made batteries until I worked at an event where there were remote control cars for kids to play with and these batteries lasted a long time. In a 5 hour period I think we only went through 2 sets of batteries per car.. and these things were running non stop! That sold me on their quality, so I bought a box for the house!"
Fantastic batteries. I used to buy all of ours from big box stores in bulk. These are a much better price and last just as long as the other brands. Now I buy them all from Amazon!
This is a great buy! Shop compare. I will definitely reorder. I have already recommended to friends.
Really great product. Tons of batteries and for super cheap. I haven't had any of these die on me yet but even if they last only half of other brands it's still a really great buy. Super happy.
It was so convenient to purchase the batteries along with the device I bought for Christmas that needed the battery. It shipped right along with the gift.
"I love stocking up on batteries at this price. Amazon, you've done a great job supplying the masses with inexpensive batteries"
I was skeptical at first of these batteries because they were so much cheaper then most but we have been using them exclusively for several months and they last just as long as other name brands
These batteries have performed just as well as the expensive ones with the super fancy space age look to them.
"These batteries rock, and they last a long time and are way cheaper than other batteries."
"These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive."
"Am amazed at how well I'm loving your batteries, Amazom. I have been a loyal Duracell buyer, but find yours are not cost way less, but last longer. Would give them 10 stars if you allowed me."
Fast delivery of product as advertised.
Fast delivery. So far light up well. Hope that it will last long.
"Started drinking the tea a week ago and already see results. Fast shipping and great quality, unlike the store bought teas. Loving it!!!"
"mu AA Amazon batteries made in Indonesia were without power after 12 months, bought in May 2016"
One of my all-time favorite coffee flavors. Extremely smooth with no tangy aftertaste.
After less than 6mos I started seeing a lot of leakage.
"Finally decent batteries at an even more decent price. Will definitely be coming back when I run out. Only thing I'd change is the packaging, but I'd rather the price stay where it is as the packaging isn't that big of a deal"
good price
Works as expected from a battery. Would buy again.
Good product at a great price.
Just as described.Fine product.
Work great fast delivery good price
"They are fine as far as I can tell. (These are probably a private label version of a major brand.) I am counting on the Amazon brand in assuming they are identical to batteries from other brands. Good price, of course. The 5 stars really reflect my trust of Amazon."
ya....fine .....I mean its a battery .....How long they gonna last
"Had to wait for more than a month for delivery. First few uses of product has not been good. In a head set had to replace batteries (3) with very small usage, evenings only, had to already replace batteries. The AAA pro cells we normally order usually last a week or better with daily use. I am not pleased with this product."
"First one out of the box I placed in a Swissphone Fire department pager. Battery indicator had 3 levels, and a new battery only shows 2 bars. That's rather disappointing, I should have stuck with Duracell, they show full charge."
I used it in a computer key board. First pair lasted only half of the time of other brand like DURACELL.I will see if the second pair does any better.
First time purchase. I have just started using them. Seem to be a quality product. I will have to see how long they last.
"The price is very acceptable, however, feed backs on file indicate these may be a trade-off for shorter life usage. One review stated having experienced battery content leakage. In any event evaluations must be based on individual usage over a reasonable length of time, so I'll reserve my decision on re-orders after first order usage"
Produces DC voltage
They work so no complaints here!

Yes It is as ecpected
yes they last just as long as the expensive kind.
"YES. Finally a battery that doesn't cost my immortal soul. But seriously, cheap batteries that last forever."
you always need AA batteries very good
You can't beat the price quality of these batteries if non-rechargeable is acceptable to you.
You can't beat the price! Lasts as long if not longer than national brands! This is my second order!
You can't go wrong buying 48 double A batteries for 13 bucks.
You can't go wrong for the price!
You can't go wrong with this many batteries at this price!
zap
Used in flash lights they lasted 4 days before they started to dim a bit.
"As stated in other posts I've made, time will tell the real story. For now they work fine."
For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem
For the price you can't beat these. I have never had any issues with them. They last long and work well.
"I've stopped buying regular batteries (AA, AAA, etc...) anywhere but Amazon.For the price, these are unbeatable for standard alkaline batteries.Especially with toddler toys....batteries come and go, fast."
"For the price, unbeatable."
When using these batteries in a professional camera flash (high powered device) they last only 3/4 as long as a similar duracell or energizer battery but for the difference in price I recommend these. In something like an xbox controller (low power device) they seem to last just as long.
"It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great."
"For years I purchased regular brand name batteries from local retailers. As these seemed to be a deal I purchased a pack. They seem to work just as well as the name-brands, just at a cheaper cost."
"Found these here before Christmas, and decided to order for our children's toys that required batteries. Can't beat the price for the amount you get, they work as expected, and long lasting. In my opinion the box they come in is extremely convenient compared to other battery packaging."
4 stars coz the batteries are in silver. Not white as shown in picture.
A lot of battery for the buck.
A+ thanks
All my remotes have new batteries
Amazon batteries are always nice.
AmazonBasics batteries are a great value and every bit as good as the name brands

These batteries hold their charge rather well. I find them comparable to the other brands I use.
These batteries work as good if not better than store bought Duracell

Yep buying more. My go to batteries
yup...they are batteries and they work just fine
Batteries are working great at the fraction of the cost of name brand batteries!
All of the AmazonBasic batteries are great. i am stockpiling all sizes because i can afford to at this price and having these at the ready is highly pleasing to me the neat freak. i also suspect these are fresher than ones you pick up at other stores that have perhaps been in their warehouses for a period of time. i got some from such a source and nothing powered up and then when replaced with AmazonBasic batteries my battery candles lit right up. Great Buy and in good quantity.
batteries are fresh
At about a quarter apiece you can't beat these batteries. EXPIRATION DATE: I bought these in NOV of 2016 and they expire in 2026.AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack) - Packaging May Vary
"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen."
"Never again will I purchase this. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. You need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries, pull them apart, then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery. Then figure out how to pull each battery out of its little, plastic strait-jacket.Even if these batteries function well, the hassle of unwrapping them (12 shrink-wrapped sets of four batteries) isn't worth any cost savings."
Batteries are holding up well with my battery operated LED candles.
"They are in my new motion sensing closet light, and they light up nicely."
Great performance great price.
"I have several packs of Amazon basic batteries, and they do the job. They are not high end batteries, but they do exactly what they are advertised to do. All of the ones I've used or tested were fully charged and worked great."
"Cheaper than batteries from the store, with basically no sacrifice to funcitonality."
Did not work.
"Shame on Amazon for putting their trusted name on this garbage! Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether AA, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won't fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicker when these are put in, remotes that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries!"
"When I purchased the Fire Stick, these batteries were included. In less than three weeks they were dead and had to be replaced. The batteries for the Fire Stick are used only in the remote, so it is not as though they got much use! I would never recommend such a garbage product."
Feel like these loose their charge much faster than the brand I used to buy. Will not purchase in the future.
Great buy
great value..
Great. Batteries
Works great. All I use now. Order a big pack of these
These are great batteries and they are real light on the pocket book compared to other National brands!
"Amazing price, amazing quality"
Batteries are holding up great
I will never not buy batteries from Amazon in bulk again! Cheapest price for a ton of batteries! I feel like I'll never run out!
Don't last very long
"Great batteries, great price. Gotta love Amazon!"
Great price but not long lasting in comparison to higher priced competitors. I got about 1/5 of the life I would with Duracell.
The amount you get is better paid for the quantity and quality you get from like target or another store.I personally love it and haven't really made a dent into it :)
"They work well. They dont last as long as duracell or energizer, but do seem to work as well if not better than most store brand batteries. They are about the same price as the store brand batteries and shipped for free. Makes them a better value in my book."
Great batteries for a great price.
Recommended by Gina.
girlfriend is diabetic and this pack will charge her pump all year. life saving product and last longer than duracell.
they work
I was impressed how well these work and how poorly some of the brand names don't. Glad I got them!
"Although I've not been able to compare the longevity of these batteries compared to the ones I used to get, I am impressed. I've had no leaks, the thin cardboard box is easy to remove and less wasteful, and I LOVE that I can store them in a drawer in the simple plastic shrink wrap of the inner packaging. It can make them a little harder to dig out of a busy drawer, but it means they take up far less room in the drawer. Very convenient."
"For the price,they are well worth it."
"Can not complain, they arrived on time, I'm not expecting them to last too long, but I needed batteries for some toys, so."
Always work great.
"Found no difference from brand name batteries. Lasts just as long, easier to manage packaging, and it's almost one third of the price."
There batteries do not last as long as Sam's or Costco brand batteries.
Bought a 20 pack to give them a try and found they dont hold up well in the tv remotes.... gone back to duracells
Are as good as any on market and price is better.
"As cheap as the warehouse bulk store brands, seem to run at least as well. Output on several tested is right on at 1.5 volts, seem to work well for most applications. 24 cents each delivered is cheaper than I can find elsewhere."
Been using them for flameless candles Work well.
Checking these out. Hope they work about as well as Duracell or Energizer. We'll see. Good price
Get tired of running out of batteries. Hope these last a while. Good product

"I purchased these batteries hoping they could hold their own amongst my other portable powered devices. Low and behold, I put these in a talking teddy bear and it proceeded to beat up the Energizer powered bunny in my house."
Just a lot of batteries for a good price.
JUST AS EXPECTED
Just as expected. Seems to work as good as other brands.
No explosions so far
Packaged well. Good bargain
Perfect. easy. come in a cardboard box. 4 batteries to a small pack/in plastic.
Seems to work just as well as other batteries. Good for using in toys. No complaints.
Strong good batteries.
They are good batteries and they last a good amount of time. Don't have any complaints.
"They seem to do well so far, I can't complain, good price and on time"
They work just like the ones you buy at Walmart.

work as well as any batteries
Work like it should.
"Works great, good price."
"works well, good choice"
Great batteries. Good to have some spare AAs around.
I like the amazon batteries and they have different sizes and quantities to order. I'm satisfied with the length of time they last and the price is OK also.
8/25/16 Very neatly packaged in an especially excessively packaged cardboard box - The batteries arrived as shown in a very protective box. The batteries themselves fit slots designed for AAA batteries - Duh ! The price and Amazon convenience make a perfect deal.I'll report their durability in my temperature and humidity sensors in a few months.
Seems like I have had several recent needs for AAA batteries. This should keep me in stock for awhile.
Good quality. I'll buy again.
Used in various devices without a problem. Long lasting and a good price! Will buy again.
Great batteries at a good price very convenient to get.
"Good batteries, good price. No issues."
"Can't beat the price. Alkaline is not the best tech - but it is a low cost battery. I'm NOT really okay that Amazon owns the marketplace and also competes against manufacturers like Duracell. They've got the upper hand. Something seems unfair about this situation. Amazon should not be competing with manufacturers - I won't buy these again. Right product wrong maker. Amazon will soon be making everything and shipping it directly in its own boats and aircraft from offshore. Is that good for me Yes, because it saves me money. Is it good for America Not really - it kills jobs. I'm going to pay a little bit more and buy my batteries elsewhere."
"I received what was advertise, which is pretty good."
"I always need batteries and always find myself looking for them or going out to buy some. I use them, as I'm sure most people do, primarily for household items as clocks, remotes and fire alarms. I ordered an assortment of sizes and found they last as long as any other battery I use in these common items. Yes, even as long as Duracell and Energizer. I haven't tried them in items such as flashlights or RC devices as most of the ones I have are rechargeables anyway. They come packaged neatly so I can store them for easy access and I don't have torn to the store. I have found every Amazon Bascis purchases has been of Quite good quality."
"Perform comparably to Duracell, Energizer. I only buy name brand, so it is significant that I'm happy with these."
GOOD BATTERIES... GOOD AS THE MAIN BRANDS AT 1/2 THE PRICE!!!
nothing but good luck with the Amazon Basics Alkalines.
"Always looking for AA batteries, controllers for Xbox seem to need a lot of batteries. Nice packaging, too."
"These are batteries, so you really can't write much about them - looks just like the picture (LOL) they work... and really, the highlight about them is that it's from Amazon, so it's easy to return if you don't want them... but also, for this bulk quantity, it was also a very good bargain for how many pairs of batteries you're getting versus buying from a store in person."
Good batteries. Have not had any problems with them. They come very nicely packaged with Amazon's fustration free box.
"Not bad... in testing these.... they didn't last quite as long as Duracell Copper top, but not bad. Great for regular products, flashlights, clocks, toys and what have you. If you have heavy drain, audio equipment I would still recommend a Duracell. Everything else.... these are fine."
"Good price but I can't tell if these last as long as Duracell. AmazonBasics with Amazon Prime are a great deal though, and I'd probably buy them again. I haven't had any problems with corrosion or other concerns."
Good price. They works.
Amazon labeled batteries are always excellent.
"As described, never had a problem with Amazon batteries!"
Can't complain. They seem fully comparable to name brand AA batteries.
Excellent batteries at a food price

Good quality batteries at an affordable price. The batteries are long lasting with good performance.
Great alkaline batteries
"Great price, great product"
I buy Amazon Bacic batteries all the time. They last just as long as the leading competitors.
I purchased these mainly for my remote controls. It's been several months and they are still strong.
"In all honesty, these batteries last about as long as any other brand. The only better thing about them is that they are cheaper."
"It's hard to love a battery. All I can say is they work, and they seem to last as long as any others. The price is good, so I'm happy."
"No complaints, seem to work as well as other brands"
"Pleased with the expiration dates, these are a good trade off, of cost and quality"
ProsGood valueWorks as expectedAppropriate batter lifeConsNone!
Seem to work fine.
Seems like fairly good batteries. Not sure if they're better or longer lasting than popular brands but they work fine for how I use them which is with some LED motion detecting lights.
The batteries work just fine. We seem to use quite a few.
These are good batteries. I have ordered them before. They work like other alkaline batteries. They also do not leak. I will order them again.
these are good cheap batteries. Seem to last just as long as the big name brands
These batteries are just as good as any name brand
"These batteries seem as long lasting as a certain copper topped variety I have used in the past. Maybe longer lasting. Regardless, they came to my door quickly when I needed them."
These batteries work perfectly fine and last as long as advertised. I will be buying again.
These seem to work as well as any name brand batteries. I'll be ordering more.
These work just as well as the well known brands. I am glad Amazon offers a economical alternative.
These work just fine. Have them in my flashlight and beard trimmer and they last. Definitely gonna keep buying these.
"They are batteries, folks. I just got them to have them available."
"They are triple-A batteries that come in a small, plain cardboard box and are shrink-wrapped in plastic. I can't speak for the life. They are currently in my calculator, and have done a good job so far."
They're batteries. Excellent price and they work well. Will purchase again
Very good batteries for price than major competing brands.
Will purchase again anytime I need batteries.
work as well as most any other battery
Work like my other batteries
Work well at a great price point.
Works good.
Works great and lasts long
Good batteries and a good deal.
Seem to be as good as any and the price is better.
Would buy again and again. Made using my bose QC15 that much cheaper!
"Love the convenience of this, good batteries. Will be reordering."
They seem to work as well as Duracell batteries. ie. Very good.
They're batteries. They work and last about as long as I'd expect. They were a good price. All in all a good buy.
Good batteries a good price
"Arrived quickly, batteries work great. I like the way they are packaged, easy to store."
Outlast many and are as good as Duracell's in remotes and such.How long they last on the shelf is not something that I can evaluate this soon. But they test the same as new Duracells.
I was pleased to see they are each marked with an approximately 10 year shelf life.
Perfectly good batteries at a very low price when on sale.
Batteries were cheap and work just as good as other name brands. I will only buy these from now on for most of my electronics.
"Good batteries for a good price. I just got them before Christmas, and I used them in battery operated lights. They worked really well, lights were bright but they didn't last. I don't think it was the battery but the lights. I'll stick to a 5 start until i feel that they didn't work with anything else"
"Pretty good batteries, they seem to last quite a while in kids toys, similar to Energizer or Duracell."
Great price and so far great quality! I haven't had them long enough to say if they last as long as other brands but so far so good!!!
"I have many AA battery operated things in my house. I use flameless candles that come on every night and stay on for 6 hours. I go through batteries. It was getting pretty expensive at the store. Found these, ordered them. Using them. They seem to be a high quality battery, unlike some others I have purchased only to have them last half as long. These are great!"
"I am impressed with the quality of these batteries. They last as long as expected in comparison to other brands. I am constantly needing good batteries for my childrens electronic toys and my husbands various gadgets, so it is great that these come in a pack of twenty. This is a thrifty way to get quality batteries, especially when I go through so many in just a short amount of time. They are packaged in a small, cardboard box, which can be opened and closed. This is great for storage and accessibility. I would recommend these batteries for sure. They are exactly what I was looking for. I will most likely be purchasing these again very soon."
"Between video game controllers, camera's, mp3's, and kids toys we go through batteries pretty quickly. I decided to give these a shot based on the price. I honestly was expecting they would drain quickly and only be good for low drain items like remotes. I'm happy to say I was wrong. They seem to last us just as long as the name brand batteries at a fraction of the cost."
"Don't seem to last as long as Ray-o-vac but the price is right. My impression is subjective, I haven't done any controlled tests."
"good batteries for the price. great for remotes and clocks, last a little less in cameras. still a great value for the price!"
Great batteries for the price. Item is as described. Please keep in mind these are not lithium batteries so they won't last as long as lithium batteries. Product was delivered in 2 days with Prime membership.
Great item for the price and found they last just as long as top named batteries out there. Can never have too many spare batteries around in case of emergency.
"These are good little batteries for the price. They come wrapped four to a shrink wrap pack, the rest of the box seems sturdy. I tested a few out of the box and they all show 1.5 volts as they should!"
"For the price these batteries works as good as name branded batteries. I would compare these to Ray-O-Vac, but NOT Duracell!"
This a a large package of batteries! I use a lot of batteries in my remotes all through the house and these amazonbasics batteries do a great job of powering up all my small tech gadgets.
"These batteries work great but they don't last as long as name brand batteries but that's ok. We mostly bought them for my toddler's toys and they work well enough for that!-As a wife and as a mom of 3 kids, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a Yes vote on my review. Thank you!"
"Batteries are good, duracell might last just a tad bit longer but the price difference is not worth the extra . Kind of hard to review a batteries, but the packaging was easy to open and the batteries were neatly packaged."
"Batteries seem to work alright, and fairly good price.Have purchased them many times now. It's amazing how many batteries you go through with all of the kids toys.I don't think these have corroded like some of the other house brands that we have bought over the years."
"Buying batteries is a bummer, Amazon makes it less painful. we like to keep a lot on hand as just about everything takes a aa battery. I haven't noticed any difference between these and the more expensive brand. money saved is a win!"
Delivery as expected. Good batteries so far.
So far I am very happy!
Good batteries. I especially liked the way they were packaged. Shrink wrapped in groups of four and in a re-sealable cardboard box that perfectly fit the quantity of batteries.
I was expecting less performance giving that these are the cheapest batteries I can find but I'm pleasantly surprised with the life of these batteries.
"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands. (i.e. Duracell, Energizer, etc.) This is the only reason I have rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else about these batteries is great. I am getting low already and will probably order them again."
"Always need a battery for clocks, remote controls, shortwave radio, etc. These are inexpensive enough that I always have a replacement nearby when necessary. I don't know how they compare to the big name batteries but they seem fins for my uses and it is nice not messing around with chargers, etc."
"Works great, packaging was convenient too."
good batteries
"These batteries are always good for me, the price tends to be the best for good batteries and the quality has consistently been good."
These batteries seem to be good quality and were a very good price.
"These batteries work just as well as any name brand, and at a really nice price point. The thing I like most is that they come in a box, not that impossible plastic packaging that slices your finger open if you look at the wrong way."
"I am pleasantly surprised with the Amazon Basics batteries. They seem to stack up with the name brand batteries just fine. Dollar for dollar, that makes Amazon Basics a winner! The best surprise of all is the absolute genius way of packaging the batteries. The box is perfect! I no longer need to dedicate a container because of the cardboard box that they are shipped in works great!"
"I'm a huge fan of AmazonBasics items and these AAA batteries are no exception. They seem to be of equal quality (as far as I can tell) to the big brands. They seem to be long lasting. Best of all, with the Amazon name on them you know that the company will stand behind the product. Batteries have gotten so darn expensive but these are actually a good price for a great item."
"As expected, good batteries, great value, not much else to say."
"Good quality, seem to last a good long time. Would compare to Energizer or Duracell."
Great packaging. Affordable. So far so good on endurance.
"I have always had good luck with Amazon Basic batteries. They last as long as top of the line batteries, so why bother paying twice as much Thanks Amazon for scads of batteries at a reasonable price."
"A lot of batteries that seem to work as well as the name brands and at a reasonable price. Plus, I love the package. Even though it's just a cardboard box, I no longer have to worry about all of my batteries dumping out everywhere!"
Good battery product! Big saver!
"Surprisingly great batteries, replaced Duracell as my go to for battery packs."
These seem to last as long as the name brand batteries I used to use in my remotes so I'll be buying them again.
They work!
Great set of batteries no complaints and long lasting!
Best batteries I bought this year.
"Cheap, good batteries."
Don't be put off by the brand. These things work fine.
"Good batteries. Used to buy all my batteries at Sam's Club, but I bought some from Amazon and have switched to Amazons. They take up less space with they way they are packaged versus those at Sam's. The Amazon ones work well. I've gotten duds from Sam's. I'll continue to buy Amazon's."
Great price. The batteries have lasted just as long as any other brand. Will buy again.
"I believe these are just fine, my kids use them and I have not heard any complaints."
Lots of batteries for a good price. Heavy alkaline. Not much more can be said.
No complaints so far!
Product arrived on time. Good batteries.
These are batteries. They work as expected and are at a great price.
Very good batteries. Bought them for my thermostat that controls my wall heater. Works as good as Duracell or Eveready. Would recommend.
Very good batteries. Seem to last as long as other brands that I've tried and can't beat the price.
Good batteries. Better than some off brand you'd find on Ebay or bulk supplier. Not as great as Duracell but close. I'll stick to buying these.
"Good batteries. Unable to do a side by side comparison, but they seem to be as good as other name brand batteries."
Good all purpose batteries. I can't tell the difference on the name brand stuff. It seems to be a good quality battery that lasts just as long as the others.
Great
"I think they are great for the price, if you want to spend more, buy rechargables"
Never thought I would buy battery from amazon brand. But everything seems good. good battery here.
The batteries perform well for everyday use.
works well
Good battery for low price
"Can't find better quality batteries for this cheap, but I have a few devices, namely a BlackWeb wireless keyboard/trackpad combo that thinks it's dead with these batteries, but perfectly charged with Duracell. They work well in my Logitech mouse and I'm sure they will do fine in my Wiimote which is why I bought them."
Great product for the price.
Works well. Good battery life. Great savings.
The batteries seem to be working great so far.
These are perfect for the battery-hungry race cars and tracks we bought our grandson for Christmas! Great pricing as well.
Great now I can't find anything that's needs them
Pretty much the best price i've seen for AA alkaline batts. I use them for flashlights and also for radios. They come packaged in a nice simple cardboard box and not blister pack.
Seems as good or better than name brand batteries.
"Work great, love the packaging!"
Good price but seemed to last a little less time than the name brands (but the name brands were much more expensive)
"pretty good life span, but not fantastic"
Does not last like energizer brand
"I have not had them long but they seem to be doing the job that is required. I will check back in later to discuss battery life if I remember. I will say, that I could have found batteries a bit cheaper around town and on the internet so I probably will not buy these again for this reason."
So far so good. Batteries last. Only issue I have had is the wrap around the batteries are a hair thicker than normal which makes them a very tight fit compared to others. I had a few ripp bc they didn't fit
Maybe a great value but many in the pack are DOA.
As described
best way to buy
Bought them for the grand kids toys at Christmas and they work fine but that's all I can tell you because it's only been 8 hours.
Excellent price for these batteries.
Good batteries and prick is right
Good batteries at a good price.
Good buy
Good buy will buy again!
Good deal for a lot of batteries. Definitely worth the money
"Great price. Don't seem to last as long as some name brands, we go through them pretty quickly."
Great value
Great!!
I have two kids under 3 years old. These work well in their toys
Really good .sending to me just 1day .and really much stuff for this price.
Solid batteries.
These batteries work as well and as long as any other that I have purchased.
these batteries work just fine and reasonably priced
"they last an average time, they are cheap and come very well packaged.If i need more I would buy these again."
They work as expected. They last at least as long as other brands and are less expensive.
They work better than dollar store batteries.
They work well and a lot less costly when purchased in this way.
Use I all my cameras at deer plots and feeders.
"What can you say, they are batteries and they work. Price was good when I purchased them.."
"Will give it 5 stars because of the price. I will update later if batteries do not last long. Looking for technical info sorry, that is not me."
"WORKS FANTASTIC, EXCEED MY EXPECTATIONS, I WILL BUY IT AGAIN. GREAT PRICE, I CHECKED AND COULDN'T FIND IT CHEAPER ESPECIALLY WITH PRIME SHIPPING."
Great product... A+A+A+A+
No issues with the batteries
I always forget to buy batteries at the store. So easy to buy on Amazon. Changed all my batteries on my devices and everything is working great again.
Good batteries for the price. Can't tell if it's the new light up report for Comcast or batteries but they go quickly.
They're batteries and they work. The real test is for how long LOL! I'll have to get back to ya on that down the road!
"Work very well, works well for a family that goes thru batteries quickly!"
Great price for the batteries. Need these all of the time with just about all the things in my house. Lasts pretty long too!
"I keep a bag hanging in my pantry of all sizes of batteries (just one of my things). These AmazonBasics have held their own along with some more expensive brands. Haven't tested them one on one with other brands, but haven't noticed replacing these more often."
OK for the price.
"These are good cells. I haven't had time to run them down yet, sso no thoughts on life expectancy"
I love amazon basic batteries. I use these in TV remotes and a couple small LED flashlights. They perform just like other budget batteries and last longer in my lights. My battery box is now full of amazon basic batteries.
I have been very happy with the Amazon batteries that I have purchased - both in this size and in D and C.
Seems to be ok and lasting just as long as normall names..good dates which is so important
"All I can say, for now, is they were delivered as promised, look good work well (so far). I think this is a good deal."
Batteries work well. Seems like a shorter charge than a duracell or energizer but for the price its worth it. Batteries will be changed a little more often but it seems to end up cheaper in the long run. Either way I am happy
GOOD DEAL
Good deal. bought to use in my COnair Defuzzer-clothing shaver.
Good price and fairly long lasting.
Great deal price per battery
great for the price
great value and product
I use these in every thing in the house. They last just as long as the name brand batties.
"Inexpensive, and they last as long as the pricey ones. I wish Amazon had a bigger pack of assorted batteries."
Lowest priced good functioning batteries.
"Originally bought batteries from Walmart.com''...their store brand...BOGUS, BUMMER, not good...ugh....Then saw these, bought them and they are great, they last a reasonable time and the price is right...Thank you Amazon."
these batteries are fine and a great deal here on amazon versus purchasing in store
They are batteries.........
They work and are cheaper than warehouse prices.
We have these on auto order as my household uses batteries like they are going out of style. Great for the Xbox to remotes. They seem to last as long as any of the other name brand batteries.
"Who couldn't use a good supply of AA batteries. And, it makes a lot more sense than buying them 4 at a time at the convenience drug or grocery store. They are as good as any brand I have ever purchased in the past."
Work great in my children's video game controllers last just as well as the name brand batteries
work just as well as brand name for a better price
Worked as expected. Fast shipping.
These batteries work great.
With children's toys were were burning through batteries quicker than I ever thought possible! So we needed a bulk supply. I didn't expect much from a generic brand. But these batteries are just as good as Duracell or energizer.
Good batteries for my Christmas lights. I like the fact that I can recycle them after they run out.
"Super deal, and work great."
Will update but no issues so far. Good deal on batteries.
Great price!
"These batteries are a great deal - comparable to warehouse retailers' prices. While I did not do extensive capacity tests or anything like that, they have met my expectations and I will be purchasing AmazonBasics batteries again. As a member of the military and a college student, I need many different batteries for everything - calculators, flashlights, gadgets, etc. The convenience and price point makes these a deal I can't pass up."
"Good deal. 48 for the price of 6 in a big box store. They seem to be fresh and have a good charge. I'm not sure how long they will hold up, but for the price, it's all good. I'm going to order a few different sizes if these last in my mag lite. (It gets used a lot....that's my test.)"
Great deal on batteries.
"I go through a lot of batteries, so for this price, these are a good deal. They are lasting a good deal of time and I would buy them again."
One of the best deals out there for batteries! Comes in a nice box for organized storage and future use
Such an amazing deal for the price. Shipping was fast. I went with these batteries because the price for the amount of batteries you get is just superb.
"These are great batteries at a phenomenal price and the way I go through batteries, a great help!!"
Work well. Price was right.
Batteries work well and are priced appropriately. I would buy them again and I do recommend them
Great batteries.
Great price . Working out well.
"Nice, well packaged."
Good deal.
"OK, I bought them in February 2016, I put the box of batteries in the storage compartment of my truck. They have sat in high Heat, extreme Cold elements for over half a year. I finally ran out of my other pricey batteries and decided to try these. I did not expect great results from them sitting in bad conditions for so long but they have surprised me. These must be a relabeled high dollar battery because none are off voltage or failing to perform as new."
Good batteries. They last just about as long as name brand and they're cheaper.
Inexpensive however I do feel that the power doesn't hold as much as other batteries that are around the same price like Best Buy's Dynex brand.
It serves its purpose.
"These are basic AA batteries that get the job done. They may be cheaper than Duracell or energizer but they do not last as long in my experience. So you must decide if you prefer quality over price... I would buy these again because they are good enough for me. Much like most of the amazon basics product line, these hold up and if there's an issue, amazon will let you return them."
Good enough for the price...I use these as mouse batteries for remote keyboard....I seem to go through a lot of them in a year...but still...no way to compare if Duracell or some other brand would be lasting longer....This is cheaper and so I keeping buying them.
They could be a bit cheaper for their longevity but they are a good value overall.
"As a rule, it's hard to tell the difference between one alkaline battery and another. Pull the Duracells out, and put in Everyready Alkaline Energizer, and you won't notice any difference in performance. Fifty years ago, freshness was a big factor, but alkaline has a long shelf life. These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while. I'll be needing AAA batteries soon, though, so I'll order them in a month or two."
"These are good basic batteries. Probably not ideal for for things that need a high-performance battey, but for flashlights, remotes they are great and competitively priced."
"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviewers are saying, they don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries. If you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less."
"basic battery. very basic, good for basic people."
"Long lasting batteries for my deer cam, compare to name brand batteries for way less money."
They don't last as long as name brands. You save money ...that's all.
Just regular AA batteries at a decent price.
Good bargain for batteries! They're great for remotes and toys.
Good price. I didn't notice any super long-lasting abilities. Just your typical battery.
Batteries for my MP3 player it takes one I sleep with it every night and the battery lasted me two nights around 16 hours in total time
"Good deal that why I bought it, you should buy it too."
"So far so good, they seem to last pretty long."
"These batteries work fine in things that don't use too much power like wall clocks and TV remotes. However,I bought them primarily for use in my xbox one remote and they do not seem to last nearly as long as brand name batteries. That said, these batteries are so cheap that it is probably still worth buying these over name brand even though you may have to replace them more often."
Good value for the money. I use them in kids toys and remote controls where they work fine. For heavy discharge items like flashlights and tools they will not last very long compared to other premium brands. I don't trust them in smoke detectors either.
Great prices. Don't last very long . Mostly used in my xbox one controller and am replacing them every other day
I love how cheap these are and how quickly they can be at my door. Ill never buy batteries at the store again. I haven't noticed that they run out faster than other brands. They have been pretty reliable. Great for everyday use around the house.
Not bad for the price only time will tell if good bye
They last a while and are cheap. What more could you want
Appear to last as long or longer than others.
"Got these mainly for use in Xbox one controllers. They don't last quite as long as energizer lithium (I'd say maybe 75 as long) but for the quantity and price, its a good deal. Will continue to use."
Nice price and works well.
Can always use these batteries. Great buy for so many.
"AAA batteries, for generic batteries these seem to last a long time."
Lots of batteries for cheap. I'm not a battery aficionado but they seem to do the job. I would buy them again.
"Good batteries, seem to be just as good as other named brands."
good value for the amount of batteries
"I was reluctant to buy these because I always buy name brand batteries, bit these are really good and work well"
Just as good as other battery brand names but at a better price!
They last a long time.
Ought these because of the price and quantity. So far we haven't had any duds and they are working great! None have corrosion either. We are storing them in the laundry room to ensure temperature control and so far feel that the quality is comparable to name brands.
Bought these for little race cars for my grandson. He goes through those batteries like crazy! So I thought I'd try the Amazon basics ones. Why not Great price! I have not been disappointed.
"Honestly, I can't think of a time when I thought batteries of any brand were bad. I haven't run rigorous tests on these batteries but I put some in a remote and in some motion sensing lights and they're still going strong.I like the idea of Amazon branded products. It makes sense that you trust Amazon to sell good products from other sellers so why not get something straight from the source. It just seems natural that they would start putting the Amazon name on products.Overall this is a good amount of batteries for the price. I can't think of anything negatives, like I said, they're batteries."
Good long lasting batteries
I wish I needed more of these! I would buy one in every color......ery functiomal for small spaces. Backless feature is key for small bedroom desk chair.
Very reasonably priced.Now buying all Amazon Basics Batteries.Good Luck
"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get."
"They work as expected. Not as long of life as other batteries, but for the price they work well. I just use them for flashlights and remotes and bike lights."
good price and they work just as well as the major brands so far.
Good batteries to buy in bulk. We have security lights that eat batteries so it's nice to have a supply on hand.
"Seems to have a short life span, but overall good item"
"Fully functional and seem to keep charge as well as one would hope batteries would. They came in a brown cardboard box which was actually really helpful for storing, and removing a couple without having batteries go everywhere."
Typical AA cell. Good per unit price.
"decent battery for the price. Mostly I use rechargeable batteries. Until I found out my kids were throwing them away because rechargeable's look too similar to the alkaline cousins. So, for the everyday item that eat the better majority of a batteries life these do the job. For those items I change maybe once every 6 months, I use rechargeable,"
"what can you say, good price, good performance, smart packaging and quick delivery, a winner for me and with these multipacks there is always some batteries when you need them"
Works perfectly for a phone with a loopy case. Good placement options for using maps.
Good batteries at a fair price.
Can't beat the price...
does what batteries should do
Good as the big brands.
Good price
good price
"Good price, well packaged. I have not used them for any real duration yet. They are shrink wrapped. However, unlike the 9 volt batteries, you can twist the package and get through the plastic wrapper."
Good price. They work.
Goof
Great price. Too soon to tell if it is a great value.
Just like the real thing. Fit just like a battery.
Not tested so I'm not sure of quality
So far so good.
These are batteries. They power things.
"arrived on time, first 4 I used had short life but remainder seems to have full power"
Need aa batteries. Good price and good batteries
"Good price and they seem to last as well as the premium brands, though I have not done any controlled tests to prove that statement."
Good price and they worked out fine.
Decent batteries. Seem like they do not last as long as Duracell or other brands.
"Good Price but a short lifetime. If you use these batteries for any device on a regular basis, you cannot expect them to last very long."
"I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optimal for devices that are constantly on. We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future."
These are available at a good price and come in handy for rounding out orders to make free shipping minimums. So far they seem to last as long as the name brand products.
"I have ordered and used several times C, D, AA, AAA and 9V AmazonBasics batteries and they have all been very dependable and durable. Now a huge AmazonBasics Product Line Fan!"
Work well and good price.
"Work just like any other batteries, except they're cheaper!"
"Great batteries, so far no problems."
They die a little faster than expected but hey their batteries when you need them
I accidentally got a AAA when I need a AA but that's okay. These came to use and they are long lasting. Good price for the quantity and quality.
Good price for utilitarian batteries. Have not had time to see how long they last vs the more expensive ones.
I go through a lot of batteries in my shop at least 4 everyday and I can't tell any difference between these or the name brand
good price haven't had any go TU yet
Good price to performance.
good price work fine
So far so good--and no problems anticipated!I really like the packaging--groups of 4 in plastic wrappers makes them easy to maintain in the package.
"Good price, and as advertised."
"I now gots tha power. Good price, decent batts."
"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far."
Good price. Have used in my TV remote and had to change batteries after2 months. Other brand of batteries have lasted longer. Get what you pay for.
Cant beat these for the price and seem to last as long as the copper top batteries in my TV controller.
"Good price, performing fine so far in all applications I have used them in. Satisfied."
"Well they haven't blown up yet. Good price, long lasting. I honestly have very little criteria for batteries besides cost vs life and these seem to be exhibiting the correct ratio for my sensibilities."
"Perfect, great price, love it!"
"AAA alkaline Amazon batteries, they have a good price and seems to be working well, I will buy them again."
"Work as well as any name brand batteries I have used. They are not the cheapest batteries, but they actually work as well as name brand batteries which is something most discount batteries cannot do."
"Good price, work like any others."
Doesnt get any simpler than this! Always have batteries! Good price!
"Good price, last long!"
"Good price. So far, so good!"
Seem to perform well. Good price!
works well with my baby's toys. good price!
Good Price! Good quality!
Good price! They seem to work just as well as any name brand battery I could pick up around town...
"Good price but quality is not really reliable.Some of them run out power real quick and others last super long.After 6 months storage, already have one pack of the batteries generates white powder type of corrosion (indoor, dry cool place, not used yet). Not sure it is quality control issue or stay in their shelf too long before shipping."
"not much to say about batteries, they do their job and seem to last a good amount of time. I like the price!"
Very good batteries.
"Work well, good price."
"Good price. When new, they tested on the low end of good with my voltmeter. I'll add to my post after I've had a chance to test battery life."
good price. convenient packaging. it fits nicely in my double secret emergeny backup supply kit for storms and zombie attacks.
Good price. Good product. Nothing to complain about this. Will probably continue buying these if the price remains the same or within a reasonable range.
Good price. Happy I purchased a bunch
Good price. Only used a few so far but what we used seems to last.
I keep purchasing them over and over.Seem to last me longer then the BJ's brand batteries. Price is basically the same
"always order these, they work well as any other but cost less"
Good deal on basic batteries. Needed several pairs for tv remotes and these worked perfectly!
Good long lasting batteries at a fair price.
good product
good product that lasts a good amount of time
Great value for the price.
So far the performance seems good and the price can't be beaten.
Trying these batteries for the first time and with all the good reviews I am sure they will be fine
good price on lots of batteries..
"Nice batteries that works as well as most others, even the expensive ones. We go through them in the remotes and game controllers. This is a great deal and worth the price.I recommend them and will buy them again."
"Great price and they are Alkaline. I feel good about buying AmazonBasic products, have never been disappointed and they cost less then their brand name counterparts."
They're batteries... What else can I say. They power anything that takes AA batteries and last just as long as the other Big brands.
Used for the led Amir motion detecting stick on lighting. Some battery batch didn't last long. The rest of the pack seems to be ok.
"Good products. I like the Amazon batteries. The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors."
Good product for the price paid! Thanks!
"I was tired of buying Duracell batteries only to have them start leaking and have to be thrown away even before I could use them at all. So far, these batteries have not leaked at all. I do believe that wrapping them as they are in just a few at a time has helped keep moisture from seeping into them. I have no complaints thus far with them."
Great product at great price. Last just as long as ones I buy from store. With having young kids these are well worth it
Always great batteries. Good buy for the price but not the longest lasting.
"Very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. This means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place."
"Everything OK: Good product, received on time, delivered undamaged."
Good product! I can't imagine that I can get some many batteries with such a low price! They are very long-lasting!
Works as expected!
Arrived in time as described. Good product.
Good batteries.
"Got them today and put some of them to work, they seem well made and I don't think I will have any problems.. Time will tell."
Plenty of juice. Way better than others I bought at a store. Decent price.
They are batteries and they work.
They're batteries. They work.
Good product. Reasonably priced. Prime Shipping available!
"Haven't conducted any testing so I'm not absolutely sure about how these compare for performance to Duracell, Energizer or Ray-O-Vac. Gut feeling is that they are about the same as Energizer and Ray-O-Vac in performance and I can sometimes get Ray-O-Vacs on sale at Home Depot/Lowes for a competitive price."
Batteries. What else can i say
They work pretty good.
Was as advertised
Inexpensive but not cheaply made. Good purchase.
Can't beat 'em for the price.
"Great batteries, last as long or longer than regular energizers and duracells"
"I bought these to use in my Xbox one and 360 controllers. These batteries are great but then again 2 batteries might last 3 nights, the next set you put in might die in the same night or they might last for a entire week. These seem to be doing better than the rayovaks."
Lo cost for long lasting batteries.
Nice quality of batteries. These run for a long time. Amazon basics products are good
"PERFECT AA AMAZON'S BATTERIES. GOOD QUALITY AND OUTSTANDING PRICE, GOOD JOB AMAZON."
"These are an amazing price and they seem to be just as good as brand name ones. I would rather purchase these than the ones at the store. For one, these come to my door free with amazon prime shipping and 2. they work pretty good and long lasting. We have only had good experience with amazon basics batteries.I recommend them to anyone that needs some good lasting batteries."
"These work just as good, if not better than any other battery."
"well made, will be buying more soon"
Good quality alkaline batteries.
"Good batteries, last about the same as any other brand I have tried, but naturally these are more affordable. I mostly use them in my XBone Scuf controller. I play on average 3-5 hours a day and a pair lasts me a couple weeks or so."
"good quality and performance, great price."
These are a large package of AA batteries and even though they are not a name brand battery they do work just as well and last for a good amount of time. I am very pleased with the quality and performance of these Amazon batteries and I will definitely be purchasing again.
"Nice quality, lasted a while, and there were tons of them!"
"Great value! They last just as long as any battery I could have gone and bought, but by planning ahead, I believe I ended up with a better value! Note...I bought these when Amazon had them on sale!"
"Battery life seems equivalent to other brands, and the price is excellent."
These are good batteries at a reasonable price and have lasted far longer than the more expensive name-brand AAA batteries that I first installed in a set of motion-activated security and surveillance lights.
Works exactly as expected.
Good quality battery and the price is excellent.
Great batteries. We'll purchase again!!
"Normally I buy rechargeable batteries (AmazonBasics) because I find them more ecological and environmentally responsible. Also they avoid the frustrating performance of almost-exhausted batteries. However, I have a set of bathroom scales where the compartment for batteries is just too small for rechargeables. The difference is tiny but the rechargeables simply will not fit.So I had no alternative but to buy alkalines, and these were my first choice. I was not disappointed, they work well and should last a long time, given the minimal use they get. However, in this undemanding application, only time will tell. For the moment, they are fine and the price was very appealing."
I'm gonna buy some AAs on my next purchase.
"Minimalist packaging, good quality, fast shipping. My new preferred method of stocking up on batteries."
"As of this writing, I've been using these for over a year and have yet to experience any problems or issues related to dead batteries or battery life.I use a battery tester, and randomly measured a few, new, out of the box, and they all rated at 100. Happy with these batteries."
good quality!
"Have been buying only Amazon batteries after I tested them. Hight quality, good durability and good price!"
"I've seen these batteries on amazon, but was uncertain as to their quality. After using them for several months, they seem as good of quality (or better) then many of the fancy name brands. I haven't had any leaking batteries and they seem to have a long life."
These Amazon Branded batteries seem to be of good quality. I have not really had them in low drain devices long enough to make a 100 opinion but so far no problem.
Good reliable batteries.
"Bought based on price. Now that we have had a few months, it would appear that these are as good or better than other name brands."
This is an economical set of AA batteries. The batteries have been lasting quite a long time and I'm very happy with them!
Love the price on this battery. I always bought Duracell or Duracell Pro and want to compare this type of battery to see how they hold. So far this battery is doing well compare to those more expensive battery.
Pretty good basic battery.
Just as good as any store brand I've used a much better pice.
So far these batteries are good. I was getting so upset spending so much money for Duracell. Got these they have lasted so I will be using these.
"they work well so far, cheaper than other batteries i have seen. hoping there wont be any leakage or anything."
"Sometimes these outperform the bigger name brands. Mark the install date on them to prove it, a cheap way to find out yourself...js"
Good price for a commodity item that is used around the house. Quantity is just enough so you have batteries on hand yet few enough to keep the stock fresh.
Generally I have good luck with Amazon Basic items. These held their charges about as long as expencted
great price on good batteries that seem to be just as good as most alkaline batteries I've used
"These batteries are great. I have no problem with them lasting as long as the top name brands. I am a repeat buyer. I use subscribe and save, and get them sent every couple months. Good stuff!"
These work very well but took longer than expected for deliveryl
"seem always need this size battery, good supply for a reasonable price"
"long lasting and great price, I have two grandkids who are gamers and these are perfect"
Equal to the name brand batteries
Lot of batteries for cheap. Perfect for the holiday electronic rush. Also good to have in my home office.
If I need an add on item to ship I always buy Amazon batteries. They work great
"Anything that can help Jeff, I'll buy"
"Excellent value, good batteries"
Fine
"For the price, seems like a good quality. I will buy again."
Good price on multi pack of Alkaline Batteries.
"Good price, they work, what more can I say"
Good Value

Great Batteries at a great price!
"Great price, they work fine"
Great price.
Great value for the number of batteries you get for the price. I haven't had them long enough to see how long they last.
"great value, hopefully these are decent power batteries. Says they are Alkaline so I'm hopeful. If these last well they will be my battery of choice from now on. Note they are available at great price as an add on to any 25 order."
Highly recommend as this is a nice quantity for the price. Thank you Amazon for making great values available for your customers.
"I used to buy duracells from samsclub until recently I started to use Amazon Basics products. These batteries have good value. I use these in my remotes, in my car door projector lights (the ones which project a logo on the floor like a courtesy light). And so far I am really happy with the battery life. Yes there are really cheaper ones if I go up with the quantity but I don't like spent money to have too much batteries to sit in my shelf."
I'm trusting that Amazon gets these manufactured at a premium manufacturer. Works fine but I'm not really putting it to the test. Good value compared to the major brands but slightly pricier than the off brands. I'll take it.
Long lasting batteries. Good value
Long lasting life
Perfect
"Powerful, well priced, convenient"
Seem to be as good as any.
Seem to work as good as Energizers I have been using.
Seem to work well will update if needed
They are batteries. They work. No problems.
"This is the 5th or 6th box I've ordered over the years. They work great, they don't leak as much as old Duracells do, at least for my use."
Very good product. No issues. Great price.
"We have young children, which means we go through a lot of batteries for toys, swings, bouncers, etc. I found it much cheaper to buy them on Amazon. They work fine and this brand seems to last for a while."
"Work great for me. I have fairly small ankles so they may be too tight for someone with large legs but they should be fine for average. They DO keep my lower legs from swelling on long shifts and keep them from hurting which is great. And they feel good, nice and silky feel"
Work well. Excellent value. Will see how long they last.
"Works as expected, and good value for money as batteries seem to be so expensive these days."
Works as expected. Good value
"Yay, a good value and now I have a big stock of batteries available when I need them."
"So, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a snag. At LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.5V) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. So I tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck. At one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tester) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basics AA cells. Like all NEW 1.5V batteries, most of them showed 1.6V which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. No new AA battery should arrive with 1.5V. This is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basics products (mice, HDMI cables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their AA batteries, but all of the house branded products. Buyer beware (Caveat Emptor) seems to be the bottom line."
Good Value and Price. Good Charge life. I will be buying more soon.
Good value and so far are working fine for me. I saw other reviews that mention a shorter battery life relative to other brands but I haven't encountered any problems yet.
Excellent packing and price
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.. What more could you want
good value deal
"Good value for a quality product. Nothing special WRT performance, as far as I can tell."
"Good Value for the amount of batteries you receive.Great for TV Controllers, basic items. Gaming Controllers eat through these rather quickly."
Good batteries that work well
Like to price and quality.
"I have had really good luck with buying AmazonBasics products, including these batteries. They seem to me to perform every bit as good as more expensive name brands, and the price is excellent. I will happily purchase them again in the future."
"This is my review on AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack) from AmazonBasics. I love the value pack....Lots of batteries for a decent price.....I am always needing batteries for something so it's nice to have them on hand when you actually need them....These AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries don't last long. Yes, there are other brands that last longer but for the price it's a deal....."
Good price and they work
Good value here. They seem to last as long as the standard Duracell batteries that we used to buy.
"For the price, one really cannot complain. It's a shame that batteries aren't this fairly priced everywhere. Amazon basics does it is again in my opinion. Good overall value."
"I hate running out of batteries so I bought this giant pack. It's a good value and the batteries seem to have plenty of juice for normal, non-hardcore activities (TV remotes, flashlights, that kind of thing). I haven't tried them in any high-power devices like digital cameras or remote control cars not sure if they would be the best choice in that case.Edit: they do not last as long as Duracells or Energizers"
"batteries, good value, enough said."
"good product, works as expected"
"As far as value goes, I haven't seen any better for a pack of 100 batteries. We go through them in ridiculous amounts with the kids toys, like rc cars and other stuff. My son has magic tracks, and those little cars take 3 at a time and eat through batteries fast. I have noticed they don't hold a charge as long as my rayovac and duracell did, but you do get a ton for the price with these. I found them pretty comparable to the drug store off brand ones. I'll still be back for more of these when we run out, especially when Alexa has them as a deal."
"FIRST TIME I'VE TRIED AMAZON BATTERIES, SO FAR SO GOOD! I GUESS WE'LL SEE HOW LONG THEY WILL LAST"
Good Value! Batteries do last for awhile!
"Great buy, fast delivery"
"Great price. Quick delivery. Work just fine in clocks, remotes, and game controllers."
Great value for high volume of batteries.
"I am finally taking the time to review these purchases, I ordered these batteries because we seem to go through so many , it seems everything uses batteries these days. Thanks !"
Very reasonably priced!
"Arrived quickly, good value."
"Batteries functionlime batteries. They don't hold their charge quite as long as some of the fancier expensive brands, but dollar for dollar they take the cake"
Did not last as long as expected but good value for price.
Good price and fast delivery.
Good value - About half the price as the ones in the store. I have been using daily for several weeks and still going strong. No issues with leaking like some cheaper batteries and they come in a box for storage. Will order again.
Good value work and last fine.
"Good value. Lots of young kids, with lots of electronics."
Good value. perform satisfactorily.
These batteries work suprisingly well and present a good value I like them better than Duracell.
They're batteries and they work. Woohoo! I'll stop buying the junky ones at Dollar Tree. Good deal here on Amazon.
"Works well, cost less."
"I'm no master at battery tech, but I do know a good deal when I see one.I had to buy a ton of batteries for the Wii U remotes in our apartment. Given the fact that the Wii U, and thus the remotes that come with it, are basically being used 24/7, these batteries were a lifesaver for their price. We got a good month extra out of the remotes, and we only used 1/4 of the batteries in the process.The next time we run out, assuming this still has the best price per battery, we'll probably get this."
"Good, cheap batteries. They work well in my fire detector and in my remotes."
"I searched online for inexpensive AA batteries, and Amazon was the cheapest I found. So far, they are performing well. I will buy these again!"
These batteries work well and are fairly inexpensive (if purchased at the right time). They are nice to have around for items like remotes and wireless devices.
Worked great and in my opinion lasted longer than some of our other batteries used them in TV remotes and they seem to last for an extensive amount of time. And thanks to Amazon the packaging was very easy to open.
"Good, reasonably-priced batteries"
"As always with the batteries, you never pay too much. They are priced just right."
"Good price, good batteries."
They are batteries. They work. Don't know what else to say. Except they were ridiculously cheap!!
"They're batteries! Does what it is supposed to do. Doesn't explode or leak. That's all I need, really."
Good. Can't really say anything bad about the AmazonBasic line of products. They just work and are usually cheaper than other alternatives.
"Goodbye brand name batteries, these are great!"
These work great and are comparable to Energizer or Duracell. I use a lot of the frameless candles and these are great for those. Great price!
Very short life in these... Bad batch
We'll see how long they last over time.
Got what I paid for and that's ok.
They seem to last as long as any other akaline battery I've used and at a much lower price.
Very good deal!Price is perfect!
"No worries - grade A - works well, looks good -say no more -"
"For the price, you can't really go wrong. But they don'5 last long.The only problem is that the battery life is not long at all. If you are using these in a TV Remote (or similar remotes) they will last 3-4 months.If you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a TV/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approx 3-4 months)."
Grand Children loved it.
"Thus far. I'm very pleased with this product. Not had them long enough to complain, which is a good thing. I have purchased these before, but these are the new and improved version."
As good as any other batteries
As good as Duracell
"Awesome value for the price, works great."
Batteries have been pretty high quality so far. no problems at all.
Cant beat price

"great value, high quality batteries"
I'm always having to run to the store for batteries. This is a great deal and the batteries work great. I'm very happy with them and only wish I'd bought them sooner.
It's great battery thanks Amazon
Love all amazon batteries
"Perfect for the purpose, and economical"
Perfectly as described
There good battiers just like others
These are great batteries have a lot of energy in them
These are great for the price! Works great and hasn't died yet. I defiantly recommend l!
They are great.
They last a long time for a great price. Ordering 3rd or 4th package
they last just like the top brand ones
they seem to be okay just as good as what I usually buy only less expensive
"They work great, good quality, and good price.Recommended"
"This is a LOT of batteries for the price. They lasted us a really long time, and seem to be of pretty good quality. We will definitely be making another purchase of these!! Can never have too many batteries."
Very happy with
Very pleased. Long lasting and economical.
We love these batteries!
"Well i have a battery tester and they tested strong. I am using them and they fit well and work well. Go for it, the price is right."
"worked better than I thought, I expected them to work for a couple of days then die but the have been working for almost a month and still haven't died"
"Works as expected, great price"
Great - no doubt about it batteries.
best value for the money...
Great !!!
Great product for the cost! I have found for low consumption devices like tv remotes that I prefer to use the AmazonBasics batteries. The lifespan is more than sufficient and I appreciate the cost savings!
"You can never have enough batteries! They work well, plenty of life."
I have grown to really like the Amazon Basics brand and these batteries are no exception. They are just as good as the major leading brands and better priced too. Can't go wrong here.
"Great batteries, no difference from these from other brand names."
Good quality. Great price! Will buy again.
"I love AmazonBasics products. These AAA batteries are a good example. Always good quality for a good price. We always need these AAA batteries for various flashlights, headlamps, and kitchen gear. You can't go wrong with these.Link: AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack)"
Great AAA's. They seem to be of high quality. Not at all like the cheap ones you will find at some stores.
Love these Amazon batteries. They're cheap and they stay alive pretty long. The box lasted me an entire year!
"Great Alkaline Batteries at a Great Price. AA batteries go quick in our house since they are used on so many items from game controllers to wireless keyboards, etc. The Price is Great so you don't have to hunt for a sale on batteries which I like.Would I purchase this item again knowing what I know now Definitely! I have purchased them several times. Would I recommend this product to someone else Yes.Hope you have good results.David"
Have 2 girls and many other little ones to buy presents for this xmas and needed lots of batteries. These work well and are a decent price.
These work perfectly. Zero leaks! I switched from the Kirkland Brand at Costco and these work perfectly fine. Zero problems with the shipping because the box is well packaged.
"When local stores don't have special on alkaline batteries, it's hard to beat the price of the AmazonBasics packs. They perform just as well as the major brands. It's nice to have a few on hand for replacing batteries in remotes, thermometers, etc."
Great alternative to higher priced brand names. These work superbly in my xbox one controller and the kids toys! Many Amazon basics items are a great value and price!
I love ordering Amazon basics batteries! We go through a lot of batteries in our house because our son is a train fanatic. I've got these AAA batteries on my subscribe and save! They seem to last as long as energizer or a comparable brand.
"Wow talk about great deal, these last longer then brand name at 1/2 the cost.Great batteries and incredible deal. First time buying Amazon Basic product but is great.Bought even more second purchase :)"
Works as good as any other name brand alkaline battery. I wish they stocked the AAA in the same size pack. Thank you amazon for a price break!
"Just as good as name brand, for a fraction of the price.Have been using these in numerous items, from remotes, to children's toys, to beard trimmer. Work just as good as name brand, and as far as I can tell the same battery life. Will definitely purchase from now on."
"Working well in various devices I've put them in - cameras, MP3 players, voice recorder and remote controls. Seem as good or better as brand name batteries."
"This is perfect at this time of year, when you are powering up so many devices."
"OK I was a little skeptical of buying Batteries from Amazon. Over the years I honestly never saw ANY competitive battery perform with the big two. After reading all the detailed reviews we decided to try them an with two little kids, we use a ton of batteries. These have impressed us with their performance. Undoubtedly a better bang for the buck than the leading brands, not to mention it is becoming increasingly harder to know that your buying genuine batteries here unless buying direct from the manufacturer like these."
I continue to buy as they work and are much less in price than name brands
Can't go wrong with Amazon basics. Great bang for your buck.
Cannot beat these for the price!!! Have good life to them. Will definitely purchase these again!
The batteries came packaged great and have lasted a good amount of time so far. They come in at just a couple cents per battery under Costco and Sams Club batteries so I thought I would give them a try and they were definitely worth it!
great bargain
"second box ive purchased, these are a steal for the price. goodbye energizer and duracell."
These batteries are a great bargain. I bought these for my mother's blood pressure machine which gobbles them up. They last just as long as the name brands that she had been using.
"These work great and I have certain string lights that come on the same time every nite for 8 hours and it's been nearly a week and they aren't draining yet, so I can't complain."
This is one heck of a deal! The batteries work great and they're worth every penny.
"Great bargain and batteries, work as well as name brand I had been using. will be using these from now on."
They are batteries. Good quality. Get the job done!
This is the best price I have seen on batteries and to have 48.......AWESOME! I pay 12 to purchase a pack of 6 in the stores.
"exactly what i need to power a million battery powered kid toys. good price, great value and always something useful to have around."
These batteries seem to hold up fine.
"Amazon basics batteries are really good quality batteries at a really good price. Most recently, I bought this set because I got a set of LED flameless candles that required 3 AAA batteries each. These batteries work great in those devices. I'm sure they will work great in anything else I try to use them in as well.This was a FULL PRICE purchase. No discounts were given."
batteries do well in most of the electronics we own. There is not a noticeable difference between name brands and these.
Batteries work as you would expect them to. They last long time for use in the flashlight we put them in.
Been using these for a while I love them will not waste my money on duracell or energizer again
best deal on AA batteries
GREAT BATTERIES AND GREAT PRICE!!
Great batteries at a good price
Great batteries for an even better price. Can't tell the difference between these and more expensive batteries
Great batteries for the price.
Great batteries for the price.
Great batteries for the price.
great batteries so far. havent had any size or issues. i will keep buying them as they even cheaper than the ams club
"Great batteries, works perfectly fine."
Great batteries!
Great batteries! I finally came to terms that everything around this house needs batteries. Every time I need a AA battery
Great batteries. Great value.
Great deal on batteries. Love it. And they last
Great price
Great price and they work and last as long as the name brands.
Great product. I always keep them handy to use on kids gaming controls and other miscellaneous items around the house.
Have used these batteries for quite some time and find them long lasting and reliable.
I am using these for wireless microphones that are often left on. The price is fantastic for the quantity of batteries. They work just as well as name brands in the products I am using them with.
"I dont think they last as long as Energizer brand, but i like them more due to the value of the quantity. I dont feel bad sharing these batteries."
I have always had great luck with amazon batteries... they last long and work freat... come wonderfully packaged
I love amazon basics batteries. They last as long as the name brand batteries for much cheaper. An economical way to keep a good stash of batteries around the house.
"I love how affordable these batteries are! The fact that they arrive quickly, are good quality, neatly packaged...there is nothing negative to say!"
"I love ordered these batteries from Amazon. Way cheaper then other brands and they last just as long. I love that they come in large packs to save more money, and that way you always have them on hand. I will never buy batteries else where EVER AGAIN!! I love themYou can never have enough batteries on hand"
Impossible to beat this Amazon deal. Great batteries
"It's amazing how great these batteries work. I've used them on remotes, game controls and electronics that drain a lot of battery. It's work pretty well for me and price is just right. You can't get a better deal than that."
Just as good as the brand name batteries! Always reliable and long-lasting.
let there be power! great batteries
Long lasting.
"Love Amazon batteries, great price and last pretty long"
"Love the quantity, price and quality. These work as well as any other battery that I have ever bought. Highly recomend."
"Love these batteries! They last a long time and the price is very reasonable. I think they're just as good as, if not better than Duracell or Energizer brand. I prefer these over the name brand batteries. A+ product!"
Nice batteries will but again
Price cheaper or similar to my local warehouse store without having to go to the store. Or in a smaller quantity. I have purchased several times. They just work.
Similar to Costco batteries
The fit and work for a long time. What more can you ask for
The price and the amount you get is amazing. So buy these batteries. You can't go wrong they are worth it
These aa batteries are affordable and they last just as long as the leading competitors or at least in my household. It would be nice though if they offered a program where people could send their old batteries into AmazonBasics so that they can recycle them but I'm sure Amazon is in the works with that idea as we speak
These are great batteries for the
These are great. Nice cheaper alternative to name brands and they work as well or better.
These batteries are great! We find that they last long and are half the price of the name brands. Would definitely recommend for families that need lots of batteries for toys.
"These batteries are great.. Ive stated before in my Amazon Basics D batteries review that i had never heard of this brand before so i decided to purchase them because i knew i wouldnt be going to the sore anytime soon.. I use these batteries for our remotes and a couple of my toys.. They seem to last a really long time.. I havent had to change our remotes since i have purchaed the batteries, but i have had to replace the batteries in my toys once or twice.."
"These batteries have been great. Duracell is probably still a bit better, but they are also more pricy. These well work just fine for anything you need them for, and you probably won't notice any difference. I haven't."
"These batteries work as well as, if not better than, the national brands at a lower price-point."
"These last long enough, and Amazon sells them cheap."
These work well and seem to last just as long as more expensive brands!
This is a good buy! The batteries last as long as major brand! Will definitely buy again.
This is a great deal for AAA batteries and a no-brainer for anyone who goes through a lot of them. The life span on these batteries seems pretty comparable to other major brands although admittedly I haven't done any actual test to confirm this.I'll be back to buy more when we work through what we've already purchased.
Very good and just as good as named products.
"Very good battery, performs like a well made alkaline brand, will buy again."
Very happy with these batteries. Works just school as the expensive ones.
"Very pleased with these. I haven't used any yet, but for the price and knowing Amazon put their name on these make me think they will be a great battery."
Very well packed and great price.
We like these batteries. They work just as well as any other batteries. Haven't noticed them not lasting very long like some of the other reviewers.
"With a toddler at home, we run through many batteries. This pack is a necessity if you have children at home. Why pay a premium for batteries just to go into a toy that will be accidently left on for days They last a good amount of time, are reliable, affordable, and are useful."
Work great.
Works just the same as the more expensive batteries.
"You can't beat the price and quality. We go through a lot of batteries and these hold up just as well or better than any of the major brands that we have in any of our controllers, flash lights, remotes, etc. We haven't bought any other brand since buying these."
"So far so good. I haven't done any studies on the batteries as others have done, but just from using them they seem to last long and have a good power curve."
"Great batteries, the first package I received contained 2 defective batteries - they were leaking fluid - but a quick email to amazon got me a whole new package. They do seem to last a bit longer than other batteries I have purchased. These are used for controllers and large graphing calculators."
as described. They last longer than I expected for an off brand battery
I bought these batteries because I needed alot for my trail cameras. The price of these ultimately was the reason I purchased them over the name brands. They seem to be lasting just as long or longer than any of the name brands that I have used.
"They're batteries. Plenty of 'em. The thing I like here is that Amazon is producing basic stuff like the Acme Company in the old Road Runner/Coyote cartoons, when the Coyote would order whatever he needed and it would be delivered (in the middle of the desert) in no time. I feel good about the brand and the batteries work just fine. You do not want to run out of batteries."
Great batteries from Amazon at a great price. As good or better than all the major brands at a fraction of the cost. They also have a long expiration date on them
"They worked great and last ad long as or longer than the name brands e.g. (Duracell, Energizer)"
great batteries at a amazing price!!
These are great! They work just as long as the other brands. I really think they last longer but I have no proof! One thing I love is the price and how Amazon does not change the price all the time. They have sales sometimes but when I run out I can always come back and get the at least the same price if not lower and that means alot to me! I really do not like battery price shopping all the time and this makes it so easy! I hope that helps! ray333ray2001yahoo.com
Batteries seem to last a long time at a great price.
Great batteries at a good price. I've had no issues with life span or degradation during storage. These are good batteries that I keep on hand for my camera gear.
"Best value batteries I have been able to find except for extreme sales. I love to get these on subscription every three months for use in remotes, flashlights, game controllers and toys."
Great batteries at a great price! Last just as long as the expensive ones. Will buy these from now on.
"Had trouble finding this particular battery, live it for my Fire Stick for Amazon Prime."
These batteries seem to be just as good as brand name batteries
We have had great luck with Amazon brand batteries and feel no need to pay big box brand name prices. We also loved being able to have them shipped to us.
These batteries are great and affordable! Highly recommend!
"These work just as well as name brands. I don't notice them draining any faster than the big names in the battery world. I'm glad I gave these a try, saves me money and the large package size means we don't run out! I'll be buying other sizes as needed. Highly recommended!"
We have a 4 month old and we have been going through batteries for his various toys with reckless abandon! These amazon batteries work very well and are comparable to more expensive brands like duracell and energizer. I'll continue to purchase amazon basics batteries moving forward
Great batteries at a great price
Great batteries at a price that cannot be beat! I've used these now for a few months and they last just as long as the big name brands. No complaints!
"Great batteries at a reasonable price. These seem to last as long if not longer than your other name brands. I use these in toys, remote controls and other devices around the house, and haven't had any issues at all."
The price of these batteries are unbeatable for the amount you get. They perform very well and last a while. Will be buying all my batteries from Amazon going forward
"I'll never buy another type of batteries again. With 3 kids under 4, you can imagine all the battery operated toys we have. I've replaced all their toys with these batteries and they work beautifully. Zero complaints!"
These work like any other battery at half the price! They are long lasting and easy to use.
Was more expensive than other batteries on amazon and the name brands are definitely better. Either buy these in bulk for a discount or go with the name brands for the same price.
"These batteries work great! These have worked great in toys and for the battery operated razor. I would say they were pretty comparable to the Duracell batteries we usually purchase for a fraction of the cost. It is insane how much money we waste on batteries, and now it seems to be much easier to buy batteries because these work great and are much cheaper. I always used to dread buying batteries."
Awesome batteries for an awesome price. I will never buy any other brand of battery's from now on they work great and last very long . I use the batteries for my kindle firestick remote so not sure how long they last in other things but they lasted almost a year in my remote before running out of battery
I love these batteries. They work great and last as long as name brand batteries.
I use a lot of batteries for the holidays and these were a good price so I thought I would give them a try. These are great and last as long as other batteries. I still have some left for the next holiday.
To me batteries are batteries so why pay more for them if you don't have to. I have ordered them in AA and AAA sizes and I don't see a difference between these and other major brands. Take the money you save and buy more toys that need batteries on Amazon. That is what I did.
Having Kids requires always having Batteries ready for all the Toys. But batteries are Expensive but these Amazon Basic Brand Batteries are great. The last as long as the Name Brand Batteries. I have no issue with Corrosion like some keep batteries will leak Acid. I get these with my Monthly Subscribe and Save order as well so the extra 15 off makes it even a better product.
I saw these batteries and decided to give them a try. I have to say they last the same as the batteries that I buy at CVS but they cost a fraction of the price. Now I know where to get my batteries from!
These batteries are great. This is the 4th tie I order Amazon Basics batteries and they have been consistent. I have used them in everything from remote controls to my sons toys and they go through batteries like no tomorrow. I would say that the Amazon Basics batteries last about 90-95 as long as Duracell or Energizer batteries and cost a lot less. I would recommend them.
Great batteries for Great price
These are by far the best batteries for the money. I used to get mine at Costco but these are definitely a better deal.
"Arrived on time, no damage. Great batteries for the price."
"I am really liking these batteries. I don't know if the products I am placing them in are working better with these batteries or if these are just lasting longer. At first I was a little skeptical about non Duracell or name brand batteries, but these are working the same if not better than those name brand batteries. I would highly recommend this product."
"I've purchased these batteries to try out the amazon version, and so far no problems just a good long lasting battery that's great for the price"
"Will these batteries run as long as energizer or duracell The answer is no. However, for the price, these are by far cheaper than any other batteries available. I can easily play hours upon hours of games on Xbox one and have no problem with these batteries. So they're great to put into smaller electronics as the lifespan is not an issue."
"Works as expected, great batteries for the price. Ordered these for daily use, especially for my son's remote control car. Been using it in clock, flashlight, toy etc, and so far they have been running well. These batteries seem to last as long as the name brands you would purchase at the local shops, but much cheaper than the shops. It helps me save a lot of money and avoid the trouble of running to the shop every time I need batteries. What I liked most about is its packaged! It comes in a card box that can be open/closed and in it the batteries are packaged with a wrapper in a group of 4. That makes it easy to find a group of batteries in my drawer. I am happy with the product and will probably order more when it run out."
These batteries lasted pretty long too!
Great batteries for the price. Haven't had any problems yet.
I have been using Amazon batteries for a couple of years and have been pleased.
"Great batteries! I was concerned to buy an off brand battery but these really work well. We have used these in the kids toys, in electronics, in remotes and have found that they are holding up very well!I normally only buy Duracell or Energizer so I am not switching batteries out in toys constantly and will be using this brand in the future as they are very well priced and work great."
Great batteries for very reasonable price. What more could you ask
Great batteries great price
Still testing them and comparing with other brands. So far i think they are great batteries and for the price and convenience i think they are great. Will buy more for sure.
Terrific deal. The batteries last just as long as normal brand batteries and are at an insanely low price! Would recommend to anyone.
I've been using these AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries for a year now. I find that they last in use just as long and the major brand batteries of the same size. I use them in small LED flashlights and multiple other items. I've not had one fail do to a leak or any issue other then they were used up. Highly recommend these
Why pay a penny more. They are exactly the same as Duracel or Energizer.
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline batteries are quite great.I purchased the 8 pack.Came well wrapped in a strong small box.I am amazed at the 10 year shelf life. This is years more than other batteries I have bought.We have been extremely pleased with our AmazonBasics purchases.Will order more batteries from AmazonBasics as the need arises.HINTGreat gift (we all know that many children's toys use batteries).Make sure the flashlight has working batteries.HIGHLY RECOMMEND
This are so much better then the Copper top and the Bunny Batteries. I use to buy mine off the bid board site. I started seeing new copper top leaking with a exp date of 2020. I ordered this and I'm hooked. This is my new supplier of Batteries.
Great batteries my kids use them a lot for I don't know. But I have use them they seem to last as long as the name brand I have no complaints. I havent had one leak yet very good product.
Inexpensive and long-lasting batteries. I strongly recommend it.
"These are great batteries for the price. I purchased these batteries for my son, who loves listening to books on the Play-Away pods from the library. They seem to last the same amount of time as any name brand battery. I will be buying these again the future."
"Great Value Batteries, though I thought it'd last longer"

"I love these batteries. They are another excellent addition to Amazon's much appreciated line of Basics. I highly recommend them - I have used just about all of the available sizes I think by now, and I've yet to hit a dud. Much cheaper than the popular copper-top which used to be my go-to battery.GET THEM! :-)"
Great batteries that work great. Much better than going to the store and spending double on some name brand batteries! Definitely Buy!!!
Great batteries to have on hand at all times.The price is excellent.There is a variety of quantity options.I would highly recommend to everyone.Thanks Amazon!
These batteries were a great price and so far they work great too. I love having extra's around and this give me more than enough to keep all my battery operated candles glowing.
Just as good as name brand but without the fancy name. They are a hasstle to open as the plastic may or may not be made out of titanium.
Very good batteries. My wife has battery powered candles in each window of our house. After going through duracells every few weeks I figured it was time to buy a cheaper (money wise anyway) battery. These things have been lasting on average 6-7 weeks!!!! That's double the life of the duracells! So far that's about the only thing we've ran them in but that alone is VERY impressive and I have found our new batteries.
Great batteries with an even better price!
Good ole AAA batteries. I purchased this in conjunction with a pack of AA and a battery organizer. I was somewhat conflicted if I should purchase the rechargeable ones or these but with the estimated 10 year shelf life and seldom I need batteries I felt these would be much better suited for my needs.
"Using batteries for my Xbox controller and they last as long, if not longer than most other brands I've used in the past and at a much better price than most name brands."
"Great batteries, but really dumb packaging. It's like they put each battery in one of those clamshells that cut you when you try to open them. Ok, I'm exaggerating, but they are individually wrapped which is super annoying when you need to use three of them. Very annoying to open."
These may be an off brand but they work just as good and for just as long. I used these in toys and they get played with often and are still going. And I actually really liked the design of the battery it looked sleek and I loved the green color.
"I have two teenagers, and was sick of buying batteries constantly. These are in mini packs of four, so I hand my kids a pack at a time, and hide the rest!"
"These batteries are great for the price. Being as affordable as they are, I was expecting them to not last long or work well. They proved me wrong and these are honestly the best batteries I have used. I've been using them for almost 8 months now and haven't had to replace any. Granted, I don't have them in anything that uses a ton of battery power, but for the price they're worth it even lasting this long. I have them in remotes and some lights and no problems!I also love being able to buy in large packs, as then I don't have to worry about getting more batteries for a long time.It's nice to be able to stock up at a super affordable price."
So excited to get these batteries. Amazon definitely worked some magic. Item shipped in less than 24 hours and arrived before they were supposed to. Packaging was great! I loved the box that can close up and they were separately packages in packs of 4. So amazed at the product I reviewed. Will definitely recommend. Thanks so much Amazon!!
"Great batteries, great price!"
I only buy Amazon batteries now! They are just as good as any other brand and way more affordable.
I usually use li ion rechargeable but I like to keep some alkaline disposable around and these are great and a great price!Chalk up another one for Amazon Basics!
Work great.
"We purchased the Amazon Basics batteries mainly for the price and shipping speed and love them. We've used them in all our household products like TV remotes, Xbox controllers and had no issues at all. So far they've lasted about 6 months in the TV remotes and have about a 2 month lifespan in our Xbox controllers which are used daily."
"I'm very impressed with these Amazon Basics AAA batteries. They are competitively priced, they work great, and are lasting longer than other generic brands. My daughter has a toddler owl clock that went through a pair of generic batteries in two weeks. The Amazon brand has lasted over a month now and still going strong.I also happen to love the white and green design. It makes them much easier to find in my cluttered kitchen drawer compared to the usual darker colors of other brands. They're bright and noticeable and that's a huge plus for me!"
Low costs batteries that work great with good extended lifetime.
"solid price, great batteries, shipped to my front door, what else can I say"
These Battery's Last Longer in Xbox controllers than the other brands
"Great batteries, work as well and last as long as top name brands."
A lot of batteries for not a lot of . These batteries have performed better than I expected and last just as long as other name-brand batteries. I will be buying these again when I eventually run out.
Another great price for batteries!
"Batteries last as long as I would expect, and they are a great price for A LOT of batteries. They cost as much as a 24 pack at the store."
"Best AA's for the money! They are a long lasting, cost effective solution for my wireless microphones that have a tendency to eat up batteries on long projects. These last as long or longer than the higher priced name brands."
Came as promised. Work well so far.
"Good decent quality batteries, fine for remotes, walkway lights etc without constant usage IE Gaming gear. Price is half of what is offered at both grocers and hardware stores in our area so go for it. I'll pen this a 5 star purchase after receiving both AA and AAA batteries while trying them out. . Nice packaging as well, easy open with no rollers in the drawer where I store them."
Great Batteries especially for the price! Amazon batteries are now going to be a staple in our household!
Great batteries for a great price!
"Great product, great price."
I can plow through a lot of batteries because I camp a lot. These batteries power and last just as long as the more expensive ones at the big box stores.
Such a great deal!!
"Supper happy with our Amazon batteries. They are shipped in the very secure, protective packaging. Every battery has worked and has had a full charge. Even if we let them sit a while, we have never had a dead one. AS far as I can tell, they are just as good as the brand name."
These Amazon batteries work just as well as name brand batteries for a fraction of the cost! I love how we can buy them in large quantities since we have twin toddlers whose toys almost always require AAA size batteries. We go through so many batteries that this is the best deal for us and it is well-worth it to buy them in bulk. We will continue to buy these batteries and I highly recommend them!
These are as good or better than the name brands you often see advertised on TV. Great price and I especially like the case they came in. I have been a repeat buyer on these batteries! Well worth it!!
These are great AAA batteries that seem to last just as long as the expensive brands. No complaints and they're cheaper than pretty much any other option.
These batteries work great! They last as long as any other battery I have had. I will definitely start buying all my batteries on amazon. A lot cheaper than a store and they work just as good. I would tell anyone to buy them!!!
These work great and seem to hold a lot of juice. No complaints for the cost.
This batteries come so nicely packed and last for a very nice period of time really amazed from this Amazon Basics product!
Works just as well as the expensive batteries!
You can't beat these batteries for the price! I'm very pleased with them they last as long as top name brands but for much cheaper I will buy more for sure
Great batteries! Can't beat the price.
Great batteries! They hold up well compared to my energizer or Duracell batteries. I wouldn't say they are equal to energizer or Duracell but they work great!
Great batteries! High quality. And so many of them! Have not had to replace any of them yet. I'm battery rich!
"Great batteries! They don't quite last as long on electronics as I'd imagined they would, but there is no disappointment compared to the money I was spending on other battery brands. I will be buying these in bulk for the foreseeable future!"
Love Amazon's batteries for two reasons:1.) work just as well as the big brands2.) easy to open box3.) much easier to store as they ship in their own normal sturdy cardboard box - which makes them infinitely easier to store than most brands which use that annoying clamshell packaging.
"Great batteries, no problems!"
We have little kids. We go through a ton of batteries. So I'm so glad we found these basics on Amazon. They work great and are much cheaper than I've found in any store. We have the AA and AAA ones. Definitely recommend them.
"Great Batteries at a great price! Love having spare batteries at all times without the high price. Works just as long as the duracell I was paying a very high price for. Try these, you won't be disappointed. Having the big pack, I don't have to worry about buying batteries all the time. Thanks Amazon!"
These batteries have worked as expected and are a great price.
These work great. Wont be buying Procells anymore...
"Will purchase in bulk in the future. Great price,long-lasting batteries even in high demand electronics. Quality batteries. Makes me trust the Amazon brand more. I will buy other Amazon branded items with confidence now."
Love these batteries and last just as long as the top name brand batteries. Amazon will be the place I order all of my batteries from. Great dependable batteries. Love ordering in bulk and having spares.
Amazon Always has great performance with a great price!Love having a stock of these on hand with lots of kids.
"Bought with some lanterns, as it was easier to add with my lanterns than drive to the store and purchase. Standard batteries, work fine. E"
"Can't go wrong with these, especially for the competitively low price!"
For the price these are about the beat batteries I have purchased.They last as long as other name brand batteries I have used.Overall very happy with the product and recommend it to everyone.
Good buy!
Great batteries. Don't waste money on buying name brand batteries.
Great price and so far so good! I haven't had any die on me just yet.
Great product for the money. No more energizer and duracell for me as these last just as long for much less money!
These batteries are a steal. They are just as good as the leading brands at a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended.
They are AA batteries. They work. I'm not a professional evaluator but these seem to be at least as good as the duracell or energizer batteries.
"They work and they are cheap. I hate getting up for batteries and not having any. You can buy in bulk with Amazon or with monthly deliveries and never worry. The batteries seem to perform well. I use these for kids toys, remotes and game controllers. They perform as expected."
This is a great deal. I have kids and So many of their toys are battery operated. These don't seem to work any better or worse than name brand batteries. There's no reason to pay more for something you'll be changing out often anyway.
Triple A batteries that work really well and are generally cheaper than other brands.
"What more can you ask for. I will not buy Duracell again until I am certain their manufacturing mishaps have been fixed, I have had numerous Duracell batteries burst within the device they are powering lately. I cannot trust them anymore."
"We really like these batteries. They seem to work just as long as regular top dollar brand batteries, at a much better price. We use these in all the different sizes, AAA, AA, C, D, that fit all of our various needs from computer keyboards, remote controls, toys, radios, flashlights, lanterns, etc."
Great batteries. Affordable. I would not buy this from local stores which charges double or triple the price of this for similar or lower quality items.
affordable batteries that last a while. will continue to purchase these over more expensive brands.
Love these batteries.
"Great batteries. I'm not a big fan of disposable batteries, but unfortunetly big companies keep on making products that require the use of disposable batteries."
I use AA's a lot and have gone to rechargeable's for most things but there are some applications that you need just regular Alkaline's.I bought the big 48 back based on the previous reviews and the value of the bulk pack.I've used these in several applications from trail cams to flashlights and have been very satisfied and find they last at least as long at the Gold colored ones you buy at a much higher price.
Great Batteries. I have bought them over and over. Much better than the old batteries sitting in the store.
Great batteries. They are highly comparable to most top name brands out there. Recently I have only been buying AmazonBasics. They work just fine.
Great batteries. They last a long time.
great batteries. They work well especially to have as emergency backups. My previous kit lasted a good long time. I usually just use rechargeable batteries but it's good to have some standard's around as well just in case
Great price for long-lasting batteries. They also come packaged in a very convenient cardboard box that makes it easy to remove just as many batteries as you need.
"Amazon Basics has a quality battery supply, not just in A4A size. These batteries lasted as long as I would expect the Costco brand and Duracells I also have in my possession to last.I love Amazon Basic for quality and cost-savings on a variety of products!!I just ordered the 12-pack of Amazon Basic RECHARGEABLE AAA ones tonight since the disposables stood their ground as a great battery!!!"
"Batteries are batteries, right But these awesome batteries got delivered to my door, so they're so much better :)"
Best batteries ever
Good battery. Lasts just as long as more expensive brands.
long lasting batteries just like the expensive ones
These Batteries have a long life. Work great in electronics remotes and other items
They work great! Will be getting more.
Great batteries at an unbelievable price. Will definitely purchase more.
"Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the name brand batteries. Get long use out of them. Love the frustration free bulk packaging. Can't beat the Amazon price compared to the name brand. Highly recommend this product, you won't be disappointed."
This was a great buy. The price is unbelievable for 48 batteries.
great batteries for the money cant beat them. I use plenty in trail cams and these hold up as good as any other name brand battery. I got these on the amazon deal which makes them an even better deal
"Great deal and price for batteries. Using them all over the house where needed. When it's time to buy again, I will reorder. Very pleased"
Only way to go for great batteries!
Just as good as Duracell as far as I am concerned.
Great battery for the price. Haven't had any issues yet.
Amazon Basic batteries perform great. My sons game computer goes through batteries so the price of these and there longevity is great.
"Came as expected, great battery life. Packaging was nice! There were small shrink-wrapped packs of 4 batteries each and arranged in a small, sturdy cardboard box."
"Can't find a much better battery value on the market. I ordered a box of 48... enough to last me quite a while. Comes to about 25 cents a battery, for alkalines. About half the price of off-the-shelf batteries."
Great battery value but they don't last as long. I will order them a couple of more times to see how they work.
"The arrived as described and all seem to work great! They were the best price of all the batteries, but are a quality battery."
I haven't noticed that these batteries go out any sooner than Duracell or Energizer (although they might). The price is right and I like how they come in a small amazon box for storage (as opposed to the plastic container). I purchased all the sizes!
"I was a little hesitant to buy these, but they've lasted longer than Duracell and Energizers in my electronic door lock. Great value as always with Amazon products!"
I will from now on but Amazon battery's! Super cheap and they actually last when compared to other overly priced battery's. it's a no brainer.
So Far So Good. I really like this brand and would recommend these to all
"This is a great deal on bulk batteries, they seem to last a reasonable amount of time. They do not seem to last as long as the big name brands (this is based on how long between battery changes for my xbox one controller) .but for the savings it's well worth it."
"I am starting to think my teenage daughter eats AA batteries for extra energy. If you need bulk batteries, the Amazon batteries can not be beat."
We absolutely love this bulk pack of AA batteries by AmazonBasics! We find that they perform up to the quality of other well known battery makers (Energizer or Duracell) but at a much more economical price! It's also great to have this bulk product aroind the house when you have kids or a gadget crazy husband!
This is a great purchase! I recommend it to anyone who isn't looking to spend the same amount for like 6 batteries. This is bundle is a great deal. The batteries last for a long time!!
"Batteries on point. Top tier, seem to perform at the same level or better than Duracell's. 48-pack for this price is hard to beat! You won't regret it."
Fantastic buy and shipping was quick and easy.
great batteries works extremely well and we put it on our smoke detectors have to change them once a monthwill buy again
great bundle price for batteries!
Great buy
Great buy. Always need batteries. They work just fine.
Great price and very long lasting. I haven't noticed any difference between the amazon basics and Duracell batteries
Happy so far..great deal.
"Nice, eco-packaging, arrived so fast, and a great price. So far so good with the battery life."
Really 48 aa batteries for just over ten bucks. What a great deal
these are great batteries and priced right...........so nice to have so many on hand!
These batteries will give durecel and eneegizer a run for thier mobey any day of the week. Definetly a better alternative.
These seem to last well.
"This is a great buy! I plan on purchasing amazon batteries from here out - fast, cheap, and they last as expected."
They seem to be great batteries lot of hot juice in them
its a great deal on batteries. hard to beat
Batteries are batteries...no problem with them.
Good batteries at a good price!
Great buy!
"Great buy! They last as long as name brand batteries, maybe even longer!"
Great deal. Awesome batteries that last just as long if not longer than other batteries!
I go through a lot of batteries and this is a great buy!
These batteries are priced very well and also work great! I'm glad I bought them and I highly recommend them.
"They work great. I buy both these and the rechargeable ones. Couldn't pass up these with the great price. :)As I said on the rechargeable ones I bought, make sure they are room temperature before using. If they are too cold or hot from transport, they might melt or explode... But that goes for a lot of batteries. :)"
Use these in the office for remotes and wireless keyboards and mouse sets. They seem to last as long as other more expensive batteries.
"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."
"High quality, power and long lasting"
Much cheaper than the bunny brand or the copper top. Does just as good of job! Highly recommended!!
GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE!! I HAVE USED several of these and they have exceeded my expectations.way cheaper then buying name brand at store. I will be buying these again in whatever sizes I need. Thanks amazon!
"Packaged well, comparable to duracell or energizer...they work just as well for a fraction of the price so all and all a good buy and will be ordering more when needed......"
"These batteries work just as well as the name brand batteries and they last just as long at a much better price point. I purchased these for the company, but I was so impressed with them that I purchased these batteries in AAA, AA and D on my personal Amazon account for home use and paid the same for a bulk package of 48 as I would have for an 8 pack of name brand batteries. They come in a sturdy cardboard box that comes in handy for neatly storing them. Amazon also printed the size of the batteries on the side of the box, making it easy to just grab the ones you need. Never again will we be asking each other if we have any (insert size) batteries and if so, where are they...or even worse, having to borrow a battery from one device to work another!"
I am a Duracell fan. I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries.
Cheap and do the job! Like how they're packaged!
Work as well as name brand. Much cheaper!
As described by Amazon Basics. These last a good while.
Best buy in great batteries. Last a long time.
"Big fan of buying batteries in bulk, For the amount, the price cant be beat. Sams club and Costco have something similar but bout 4-5 more."
Can't beat the price! Wouldn't go anywhere else for batteries.
cheaper than name brands and last just as long
good deal and nicely packaged
"Good for the price but--while I am not sure--it seems a few were duds. Even so, the price point beats the field."
Good quality
Great Batteries
"Great batteries at a fabulous price, what else can I say .... Seem to last as long as actual Duracell"
Great batteries. I have re ordered many times.. they are just as good as enegizer !
Great deal
Great deal
Great deal
Great deal and love the box they come in.
Great deal for so many batteries! Amazon is wonderful.
"Great deal on batteries, I have a baby so lots of things need batteries around here and these are a great deal. I don't think they last quite as long as an energizer or Duracell but they are still comparable."
Great deal on batteries.
Great deal on batteries.
Great deal.
Great deal. Batteries work great.
"Great price. Not too amazing in terms of battery life, but I do not think that you could get a better deal."
great quality
Great value...same quality as the big boys
I bought the 48 pack to get the best price on each battery. Great deal.
I love that Amazon Basics - why pay more for a brand name of something like batteries.
I think this is a better deal than costco. They simply work
"I thought this was a great deal for batteries. I bought these for my computer wireless mouse at work and home. I always leave my mouse on and I know I shouldn't, I just forget!These are great and have lasted longer than I have thought. I've only used two out of my pack since buying this."
"I've been buying these batteries for a while now in every size.... They last just as long as the other ones, sometimes I think even longer and at a great price.... I'll never buy batteries anywhere else again!!!"
On batteries
"Second time I've bought these, so that should tell you how well I like them. Can't be beat for the price even at the big box discount stores."
Such a great deal. These work great and I love never running out of batteries!
These are just as good as name brand.Will always purchase these from now on.
These batteries work great. No problems with any of them so far. Would definitely buy again. I think they're about the same price as the costco brand ones.
"they work great last long, maybe even better longer than big name brands"
This deal is beyond amazing. Come Christmas this box of batteries for the kids toys is going to be a great deal. I was able to fill everything that took batteries in the house and they last quite a while too
We have a few devices that take a huge amount of batteries so I thought id try out these. They seem to be doing just as well as the top name brand batteries.
"We have a lot of baby toys that are battery operated. Amazon to the rescue. Now, I can keep them all working"
"What a deal, nice, good life, way to go Amazon"
What a great deal. I just hope they will last as long as the big brands
"Yep, they are batteries. Dirt cheap. Why spend more"
Great deal and a great value
Not much I can add to all the compliments already spoken about this deal....I have been ordering them for years and have never had a dud. They may not last as long as the very best that are out there. But that is what it takes to beat them. For the price they are a great deal and I highly recommend them...
I'm o lynordering batteries from Amazon from here on out. Great deal and long lasting!
My family eats batteries. These have lasted well - no noticeable increase in battery consumption - meaning good battery life compared to the Duracells we have bought in the past.
Great deal buying Amazon branded batteries. These last as long as any others I have used. If they added a pre-paid mailer to recycle them it would be great.
Great Deal and so far I have not had any issues.
Like the new (to me) packaging for these batteries. I do not test as thoroughly as others but these batteries seem to work just as well as the more expensive name brands.
Great deal for decent batteries!!
Great deal for so many batteries. As far as I can tell the batteries last a long time. After putting them in a flashlight it stayed bright and didn't dim after heavy use.
"These batteries are seeming to last a good amount of time. I think this product is a GREAT value considering how many batteries you get for the price, they are reliable and durable as far as I have used them. Great bargain!"
"This is such a great deal that I opted for the 100-battery package rather than spend the same amount on a pack of rechargeable AA's. At only 13 cents per AA cell, it is less than the cost of X minutes of my labor associated with charging multiple rounds of rechargeables (since I only have a 4-bay charger.) If you need a sizeable number of batteries at once, this deal is hard to beat.They're all meticulously packed in 4-cell wrappers, so you won't have 100 batteries rattling around and tipping over in a jumbled mess. The entire line of AmazonBasics products is impressive----these batteries are no exception. I will definitely repurchase these."
Great deal for a parent of 2 girls that have toys that all seem to require AA or AAA cells.
"Great deal on batteries, however they tend to burn out pretty quick (compared to like a duracell). Price is still worth it!"
Great deal on batteries! We have used them in kids toys mainly and they seem to last about the same as any other brand.
"Great price, fast delivery...what else could you ask for"
"Look its an established fact of life that if you are going to live life in the world of the living at some point you will need to buy batteries. You can purchase expensive ones that have slick tv ads or you can purchase dead duds at the .99 cent stores or you can achieve a happy medium and purchase them through Amazon. At this price point, this many batteries is a great deal."
I use these for my remote flash triggers and my intervalometers and they last a pretty long time.
We go thru a lot of batteries in this house so finding ones that work great and are inexpensive can be a challenge. These are both. These have worked with no problems. Would definitely purchase again. Thanks!!
Double AA batteries for about for about a quarter apiece. Very solid deal. Five stars.
Works as expected. Great deal on the item and have enjoyed using it.
"Really a great deal for 20 AAA batteries. I'm positive they will work just as well as the higher priced batteries, lasting about as long as the other brands. Amazon Basics are good products... I'm using an Amazon Basics keyboard to type this review. From batteries to keyboards, don't be afraid to buy Amazon Basics products because they are just as good as higher priced products."
"Great deal- don't waste any more money buying batteries at the store! You can't beat the price and they work and lask as well as brand name batterys. It it amazing how much cheaper these are- and you get twice as many. I got these in AA, AAA, C and D. The main reason I even bought them was when I was looking for flashlight batteries- size D for my trusty maglight (yes they are heavy but I love them for it, they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down) and size C for a different flashlight. Of course I needed an odd number and couldn't believe how expensive they were in the store. I checked Amazon- had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes- the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries. Did I need this many AAA batteries at the time- nope but let me tell you I'm so glad I got extra- less than a week after buying them I had already nearly used every one. I went around the house and replaced every remote and device I could find and they work great! With AA and AAA size I'd recommend buying a bigger pack- yes it does seem like a lot of batteries at first but trust me you'll be glad you got extra- it's one of those items every house needs and easily gets overlooked."
"Buy these! Great deal, good performance. Repeat purchase."
Great deal! We've purchased our batteries from amazon the last several times that we've needed to restock.
Very professional packaging. Packs of 4 are individually wrapped in plastic - very helpful in organizing (knowing which ones are new). They seem to be working very well in my electronics. Great deal!
"Nice price, seem to work great! Will post again if they are no good."
"Great deal, they are just as good as name brand batteries"
An absolutely awesome deal! They seem to work really well. Will buy again!
Came on time good deal plus really needed them
"Excellent, no issues"
Fine! These seem to last as long as the name brands and are much less costly per battery.
Great batteries and 8 cheaper than the competitor that I normally buy!
Great buy! Why spend more than this for 48 batteries!
Great Deal!
Great deal!
Greatest deal on the planet!
Love these batteries and price was fantastic for the quality!
Such a great deal for a LOT of batteries! It's always nice to have so many on hand. You never know when you're going to need them. Haven't noticed if the life is shorter than brand names. So far so good!
"The ones that I have used appear to work well, and are still going strong. Great deal!"
These are a great deal for how many batteries you get. These are good quality batteries and last just as long as your typical name brand batteries.
"These are great batteries and I only buy them from Amazon now. Long life, better than the Kirkland brand that used to buy."
These batteries work great. I'm impressed with the quality/quantity and price!
These work great and the price is fantastic. These are the only batteries we buy now. We stocked up on various sizes of the AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries so we always have some on hand. This is particularly handy with two little kids and countless toys in the house!
This is a great deal.
This is the best deal on batteries around! They work very well! I replaced the batteries in all my kids' toys.
We needed a bunch of batteries for toys for a children's Christmas party. The price was right!
Work great. Good price!
Work just as long as the big name brands at a fraction of the cost
Works as intended lol
Great deal! Amazon is a brand I have come to trust.
Great deal! Love Amazon basics batteries
Great deal!! So far so good.
this work great so far! Such a great prices I was waiting for them to fail but so far they are working like powerful batteries should!
"Great deal. While they may not have as much juice as Duracell or Energizer. They cast a lot less. They last close to as long as the big 2 also. These are also way better than the budget batteries out other, which tend to die out after a couple days. These are still going strong. So overall great deal, great product, and worth every penny."
"Great Deal.Arrived as described in standard, basic cardboard box--nothing fancy--and packaged safely.I'm using it strictly for wireless trackpad and wireless keyboard, and so far, it's out-performed Duracell and Energizer."
"Always quality, always on time. Love Amazon's batteries."
"These are the best most economical batteries you can get for low volume consumption items (which is 90 of what we use these days). I've used dozens of these and never had an issue with corrosion are leaking. Used mostly in remotes, toys, flashlights and general household items. Excellent bargain. Now we need to get Amazon to provide recycling as well!"
I found the electrons in this brand of battery to be more uppity than in other brands. They get jiggy wi' it.
Great packaging and value
I bought 2. That is my review.
i buy these all the time. get these and it wont bother you how many your kids go through.
Arrived on time. Great for baby toys
"These basics batteries rock. They are affordable, and they last plenty of time. Great for devices you cant use rechargeables in."
"This is the first time that I have bought Amazon batteries but the price was fantastic and we go through so many batteries with electronics,Grandchildren's toys,flashlights and numerous other items around the house.They last just as long as the best selling batteries do,nobody could tell a difference.Thank goodness I bought these before Hurricane Matthew because we lost power for days and these batteries held up very well and lasted a long time and you get so many to the box,48 total.We had mini flashlights,electric candles and large flashlights and I still have over a half of box left.I will be buying these batteries from now on and so will my daughter and sons.Very impressive!"
"These work great for household items. I use them in my remote controllers and etc. These batteries are significantly cheaper than other brands and I highly recommend these for household items. That means items that require minimal power. Gaming controllers, flashlights, and toys are examples of non-household items."
"Now that is A LOT of batteries. I did not take a meter to them, but they appear to last as long and work as reliably as any name brand battery. Great for keeping all those Christmas presents going."
We use these for our son's toys and they last a long time. No problems at all. Highly recommend these!
"Not bad Amazon, not bad.The Good: Price, performance.The Bad: Longevity. If you're using these in anything that's going to see a bit of use, I'd just get the rechargeable which are great quality. For the price increase of some of the larger brands you will be able to replace the batteries several times before spending the same amount of money."
"I use these in my insulin pump. I have noticed that when I buy a larger quantity of batteries, I usually get a few duds. Not with these! Every single one has worked!"
"We purchased these batteries for remotes and any other small gadgets (non-demanding cameras, etc.) around the house that use AA. I will continue buying them as so far they have fit our needs perfectly."
I would recommend a more expensive battery for running electronics like cameras or Nintendo ds but they work great for remotes and other little things that rarely need to have batteries replaced
Works ok. Doesn't last too long
"Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remotes in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices."
Great batteries and nice low price. Very comparable to name brand high priced ones. I will never buy another brand!
"Great buy, a lot of batteries for the price, no issues with dead or weak batteries."
Great for the price
Last a decently long time. Great for the price!
Nice quality and good duration. And it's a great value. Plus it's a huge pack so hopefully I won't run out for a while.
Regular batteries
These are a great deal for the price. It always comes in handy to have extra batteries around.
"These are great! They come in a frustration free box that is great for storing them. For the price, they work well for me. I use these for a LED motion sensor light that I use in my bathroom."
Work fine at a great price.
Work well
"These batteries are a great value. I got the 48 pack and for the most part, the did not disappoint. However, there were a few that did not work. Then again, i've always been pleased with Amazon's products and will continue to use them."
We go through a lot of batteries! I have a 7yr old believe me when this kid uses A LOT of batteries I mean it!! I was in the market for a quality inexpressive battery! Glad to say I found the perfect one! We are stocked for a while thank goodness. His controllers for his game systems require batteries and we go through many so far he has been using the same Amazon batteries for a week and the controller charger has not even gone down its still at full charge pretty impressive!! We notice the batteries we have been using get drained pretty quickly! Overall very happy with the purchase!! I think these will suit just fine for lots of toys!!
"We go through batteries in our household (3 boys) like there was no tomorrow. We have a few rechargeable stations BUT there is always a demand for batteries somewhere! After a bit of research here and other online locations, these batteries were less expensive and someone here did a great review and that is what lead me to buy these. We have NOT been disappointed at all and actually find them to last a bit longer than your name brands. Thank you Amazon and we highly recommend them! :-)"
Plenty of power for your average household ham and egger.
"They Work For Me, Don't See a Difference between the other brands. Its Cheap so I will buy it again when I run out."
"Cheapest batteries around and seem to last just as long as duracell or energizer. Don't be fooled by expensive batteries unless you are using them in some high drain device that doesn't have a rechargeable, which don't even really exist anymore. Can't vouch for shelf life."
In support of the snmap circuits - I was very happy with this purchase for my 9 year old grandchild who loves electroniucs and uising his hands
i think these are just as good as any duracell or energizer
Great investment. I wouldn't rely on them in a high powered devices (even though I haven't tried them in anything other than computer mice and remote controllers) but I still have 90 of the batteries even after half a year of lying around. Great investment on batteries for when you need them.
great item
great item
"Great item, great seller"
"great item, very pleased!"
So far great!
These batteries have lasted just a long if not longer than the brand name.
"You would think that these are the cheapest of the cheap batteries that just don't last, but these seem to keep up with the brand names. Worth the price."
"These batteries work great! They're not quite as good as Energizer or Duracell but they are a close second when it comes to the life you get out of them. When you compare the cost of these to the name brand examples just gave, these are a no brainer. I cannot recommend these highly enough. You will not be disappointed."
Nice product .really enjoy the product. And on time delivery.Really good price on the batteries. And long lasting. Good product
These batteries arrived on time and where exactly as described. They seem to be holding up as well as any name brand battery and I would highly recommend these. I will definitely order them again.
"These batteries work very well and come packaged extremely durably. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish I had bought more, as these ran out quickly after all the toys my son received for Christmas this year. Can't go wrong with Amazon Basics."
Amazon brand batteries work just as well as the other brand name batteries not to mention at a more affordable cost too.
"Bought this along with Maisto R/C Rock Crawler Radio Control Vehicle (Colors May Vary) for a grand son's birthday, so his parents would not have to hunt for batteries, They have said they were long lasting, and were very happy with them"
"I love amazon batteries. I use these in xbox controllers to flameless candles and flashlights and all work great and long lasting, as good as top name brand batteries but at a better price."
"Office use, works great. I would highly recommend a battery tester! My sons constantly say that wii remote batteries are bad when they aren't!"
"Great pack of batteries. They seem to work as good as any AA batteries I've had, and are very convenient to order an Amazon."
I love the packaging of these batteries! Don't have to worry about them falling out all over the place. I ordered the C batteries for a lamp and there have been no issues yet. I trust these to last long
Great packaging - nice little card board box to store the batteries in. Beats the packs batteries usually come in.
"Love the fact that they come packaged 4 batteries to pack, put in a box that you can open and close. No more fumbling with batteries."
"The easy open packaging is superb. No idea how these hold up to other batteries, but I trust Amazon to deliver a good product."
Great performance from these comparable to name brand options
"I have repeatedly ordered and reordered AmazonBasics batteries. I've always been satisfied with their performance, and the value for the money is unbeatable."
"Very good performance and long lasting at a better than the dollar store price. I use AmazonBasics in a laser pointer at least twice daily for about twenty minutes a day. My dog is high energy and we live in an area where the weather is yucky and inclement. Yes, I know you aren't supposed to use a laser with dogs (I found that out 2 years too late). But that is the only way my dog can get enough exercise and not drive me crazy. I use to good through batteries like crazy. That being said, I have tried the better brands and AmazonBasics batteries and these seem to be superior in duration and very affordable."
Works just as good as other batteries that I have bought. Even in high drain electronics! Great value for this price!
"We got these because they were inexpensive and we wanted to have plenty on hand for our Christmas window candles that have a timer. I bought the big box because I thought since they were so cheap, we'd have to replace them partway through the season. I'm pleased to say that the original set of batteries I put in the candles at the start of the Christmas season, about 6 weeks ago for us, are still going strong!"
I am so happy to see amazon offering batteries through AmazonBasics. A wonderful addition to our subscribe and save orders! Just as good of quality as any other alkaline battery that we have ever had.
Recommend
"Oh these are amazing. Compared to the other amazon batteries I've used, these are so damn powerful. These are me new favs. Work much better than a lot of brands I've seen. Definitely recommend"
A bunch of triple A batteries at a great price. I don't go to anyone anymore for batteries or chargers except amazon basics. There really is no need to pay more for batteries than the cheapest price. I would not be surprised if these are re branded batteries of some major manufacturer. Either way they perform up to par with other name brand batteries.
"Can't beat it, great price. Batteries might not last as long as some other brands but it's still worth it"
Can't beat the price for 48 batteries.
Excellent deal for 36 batteries. I have found the batteries do not last quite as long as Duracell or other brands. Not as noticeable in remotes or such but flashlights will drain them quickly. They are still an excellent deal though.
Excellent price
"Good batteries, cheap price. What's to review"
Great batteries
Great batteries and amazing cost I also love how they come packaged easy to store away and use when needed! Thanks Amazon!!
"Great batteries for the price! We are one of those families that goes through a lot of batteries. It seems we need them more and more with ceiling fan remotes and remotes for technology devices. The batteries seem to last just as long as any other brand, but these are far cheaper."
Great for all of those Christmas toys. Great price.
Great for toys as the last thing you'd want to do is run out of batteries during the holidays disappointing the kids. I've had no problems with quality and for the price I can't complain as it does the job. Thanks Amazon!
Great price but they do not seem to last as long as other batteries....at least according to my sons who use them in their Xbox controllers.
Great price for this battery size.
Great price for this many batteries compared to shopping in a retail store.
Great price great item. Would buy again
"great price, I look forward to using these and seeing how long they last. will update when known. Packages very well"
Great price! No complaints
"Have installed these in several devices and they are working and lasting fine. I'm always leary of off-brand batteries, but these seem perfectly fine and were a great buy!"
Inexpensive and works just as well as a more expensive battery
These batteries are a great price. I need to use them and see how long they last before giving a higher review.
work well
Works great
Works well
You cannot beat the price! The batteries are of good quality too and last a while!
"Great price - but you get what you pay for. In our Xfinity TV remote, these last 25 of the time the Duracell's lasted. Overall, they don't have lasting power like the top brands."
Great price! I finally put a big storage shelf in my garage so starting to stock up on things I use regularly. My only complaint is they are packaged in groups of four which is kind of a pain to unwrap each time you need them.
They work pretty well so far :-) great price!
No issues... great price and delivered in two days.
great price
These batteries are great. I love that they come in a box organized so you can just close the box back up and don't have to worry about keeping all the batteries together. They seem to work as well as the other batteries! I love these!
Great price and great performance. I loaded 10 of these batteries into my Field Camera 6 months ago and the camera is still taking pictures.
Great price and great performance!
They work as well as the advertised brand name batteries. Great price and great product as far as I'm concerned.
These are fantastic and arrived quickly.
"I love the AmazonBasics Batteries. I only buy from Amazon Basics now, unless I need batteries right away or Amazon prices them higher than others, which has happened a few times when their stock is low it seems. The price is hard to beat for how many batteries you actually get and they seem to last just as long, if not longer than the more expensive brands. They definitely blow the cheap brands out of the water with their quality and life as well."
My roommates stole them all and never complained! great price and long lasting
"same as above batteries, great price and long lasting and appreciate quality and great price"
"these are the only AA batteries i buy now, great price and outlasts any of the batteries from the big box stores"
"I haven't tested them to compare to other brands, but the Amazon batteries are a great price and great packaging. It's a nice add-on product and amazon makes it easy to stock-up on batteries without name-brand prices."
"Great price and they work- can't ask for more then that. How does Amazon do what they do- good price, great customer service, and they are very profitable. What a great business model!"
Great quality
These batteries work as well as the name brand and cost far less. Will be buying my batteries from Amazon from now on.
Great and they seem to last a little longer than the name brands I have been using. Will be using these in the future.
Good price and they seem to last and work as well as name brands.
"I have a lot of electronics that require AAA batteries (baby toys mostly and of course tv remotes) , so decided to save some money and went with this.It's been a few weeks and the batteries are still going, just imagine two 12 month babies playing with toys that make sounds and lights on and batteries are still holding the charge.Even if the batteries didn't last that long, there's plenty of them to swap them for the price you pay."
Not much to say. They are batteries and they work. Great price and they last just as long as any others.
These are just regular batteries but what makes them great is the price. We go through a lot of batteries at a big expense - or we used to. I'll be purchasing these AmazonBasics batteries from now on. Good money saver.
"Can't believe how many you get, and they work great!"
"Decided to give these a shot and glad we did. Batteries work just fine and cost much less than the big name brands. We like to keep AA's on hand for remotes, flashlights etc. but they sure came in handy for Christmas! We'll definitely buy them again!"
Great batteries
Great set of batteries. Comes in handy for all the equipment I use.
"Good price, but have not had enough time to find out how long they last compared to other name brands."
Amazing price for batteries!! We go through them like crazy and these actually last longer than some of the name brand batteries that we spend tons of on!
"WONDERFUL price for these batteries! I am a photographer and use them short term of my flashes at weddings - and they work great till I switch them out for the next wedding! I also use them for my kids toys, and they seem to last a long time for those longer use items as well!"
"Great deal on batteries!! These lasted the Christmas season for us (from early December to mid January) with no problems. We have too many decorations that play music etc because my 3 year old loves them! All batteries were still working when we removed them to pack away the decorations for next year, so I can't comment on how long they would normally last."
"Great price for a lot of batteries. And the batteries are still going strong, so they last just as long as the other big name brands. I would recommend buying these."
"Nice amount of batteries for the price. I use in everything from remotes, controllers, flashlights, kitchen gadgets etc.. and they last a decent amount of time. Comparable to the copper top batteries for sure. I will definitely buy AmazonBasics batteries in the future, whatever size I may need. They come nicely packaged in a box so they stay nice and neat and you don't have a cluster box of batteries. Great value!"
"Great price for a ton of batteries that last a long time. What more can I say They're just good batteries, and it's definitely worth it to invest in them in bulk."
Love the packaging of 5 in a pack. Shared a pack of 48 with a friend. The price was less than 30 cents each which is very special.
"Great price for alkaline batteries. They seem to work as well as any other batteries I've purchased. We use a lot of batteries around here and if I can save a little money and still get a great price, why not Thanks Amazon for a great product."
"Great price for basic batteries. Much better option than grocery store, and comparable price to warehouse store!They seem to last a decent amount of time as well!"
Good deal for batteries that we seem to use a lot!
Great price for batteries!! They do the job as expected! I was nervous they wouldn't last as long because they were so cheap but they last just as long as name brands.
"These batteries work very well, and the price is definitely much better than what one would have to pay in a store."
"They work great, they're an amazing price and it's wonderful to order them in bulk - so we always have them on hand when needed. A great subscribe save item. Love this product from Amazon!"
Once again...Amazon delivers! I use a ton of these batteries I even tried the route of buying info on how to recharge unrechargables...but in the long run it was a big pain in the you know where so I bought these! I'm happy! Thank you!
"These came in handy! great price for so many, months later still have some left. bought these for my husbands xbox controllers."
Great price for so many AA batteries that work and last just as long as the name brands. Thank you!
great price for the quantity - much cheaper than the store. appears to be a good quality from what I can tell. definitely will buy again.
great price good quality
Good all round lasts long with plenty of power
"Great deal for the amount of batteries. Good battery hang time, mainly used in cree led flashlights nothing to high drain."
"Great Price great value, and nice box to store them."
Can't beat the price. How long these batteries last or how effective they are still remains to be seen.
"You can't beat the price on these batteries, but unsurprisingly, they don't last nearly as long as name brand ones."
They are batteries. They work. Like Batteries Should.
"These batteries are great, and I love the price on subscribe and save. With so many kids and toys and things requiring batteries, I get this every 2 mos."
They perform as advertised.
Great price to replace all those batteries in electronics. Seems to last about as long as the major brands.
Product works as advertised. Great price with fast delivery.
Reasonable price great quality would buy again when I need mord. George
Great price!
"lots of batteries, great price, and decent quality."
"Great price, and more convenient than going to Costco"
"Excellent quality, long lasting - so far so good."
"I have 3 kids so that means a lot of toys that require multiple batteries and id rather not spend an arm and a leg on batteries. Great price, arrived promptly and seem to last a while!"
"Great price, arrived quickly, and last just as long as any of the name brand batteries we have used in the past!"
"Lots of batteries for all of those every day things, great price, fast shipping"
"I have used the Amazon Basics D cells and they were just great, so I am sure these will be fine at a great price."
You really can't beat these batteries for the price. No noticeable difference in their performance so far. We've started keeping these in stock at the house in both AA and AAA and have been using them for several months so far. Another great product for Amazon Basics.
"A fair sized collection of AAA batteries that seem to function just as long as the more expensive brand. No complaints, will buy them again, as I have several gadgets that run on AAA batteries."
"Nothing to complain. Great price, great product!"
"Wow, large amount of batteries for a low price, I use them in all my clocks, 15 different remotes through the house, thermostats and other items. I may never buy a regular battery again."
I use a lot of these in a headlamp I wear. Great price and they seem to last as long as any other brand I've used.
"Had no idea til I went looking that Amazon sold their own brand of batteries. What an incredible bargain! We go through AAA batteries like there's no tomorrow. I had to stop wasting money at the Dollar Store. When I saw these, I decided to give them a go. So far, they are outlasting the ones I usually get for a buck per pack. If this keeps up, then I can say Amazon will have me as a future battery purchaser every time!"
Great priced batteries delivered to my house! Score!
"Work great, and saves me a trip to costco since they are priced around the same."
"Great price, work as long as any other battery"
Amazon batteries are long lasting and well-packaged. We have never had any issues with them here in our office and the price is better than you will find with any others. Highly recommend.
Can't say enuf about Amazon batteries....I love them!
"exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!"
"Good price for the quality, thank you!"
Great buy! Seems like i go thru a ton of batteries and these were a nice buy. Will purchase again!!
Great Price
Great price and seem to last just as long!
Great price and works as well as the name brands!
Great price!
"Great price!!! These last as long or longer than name brand batteries. I haven't had to replace a single one in 8 months! Will be getting more, and more sizes for sure!"
Last just as long as any named brand.
So far so good. I use these in a flash unit for photography. While not fully running off the batteries as I have an external battery pack they do work well.
They are a great price!
"we always need these for kids toys, and LED lanterns, etc. Great PRICE!"
Works as good as other batteries
Great price! Great product! Haven't noticed any difference from other name brand alkaline batteries. I will definitely buy this again.
"Great price! I actually really enjoyed the special packaging they were raving about. So far, they work great! Is there anything Amazon doesn't do! Haha."
"Great price! I found no difference in the longevity of these batteries, as the more expensive brands."
"Great price! What can I say, besides that they work and so far haven't showed less quality from a brand name battery."
"We go through a lot of batteries in our house, so when I saw these come up on a lightening deal, I swooped them up! Amazon makes great products."
GREAT PRICE!!! And they seem comparable to any Duracell or Energizer for a third the price!
48 batteries for twelve bucks Where are you going to beat that price!! That's only 25 cents per battery!!!
"Decent batteries, great price."
Duracell quality. Great price.
Fast shipping. Great price.
Great price for these alkaline batteries. Being that they are AAA there is not much of a power drain for devices like remote control. I found that the AA amazon basic batteries will not last as long as as you named brand alkaline batteries.
Great price for this quantity of batteries. Seem to work just fine for all of my needs.
Not sure what else to say other than these are cheap batteries. Great price.
They're batteries...what more can you say Great price.
Work great at a good rate.
work as well as any of the big battery brands. Great price. A++++ for amazon.
I am trying them out. Great price. I have been using them for about 4 days. I am hoping for great results.
Great price. They're batteries.
Great price. Worked well for us so far.
Great price for some really good batteries
"Great priced batteries! I use them in smoke detectors in rentals with frequent turn over, remotes, controllers, and various other items and have never had a complaint."
Great prices. Will see if they last as long as Duracell.
"Worked as expected, great pricing, simple packaging."
Awesome Value
"Cheap batteries for the win! They work. They last a reasonable amount of time. I can't compare to other brands because I don't track batteries that closely, but they last long enough for me. I would buy again."
Did as they were supposed to do.
Great batteries. They last longer than the name brands at a great price.
Great product
Great product and fast shipping
great product very happy with the purchase.
I have a few of these and they work great
I needed batteries for a set of walkie talkies that I ordered from Amazon. I ordered these at the same time to make sure I had batteries. These seem to last as long as any other brand.
The batteries work great and the expiration date freshness is good.
These are just as good as competing batteries and less expensive. With Amazon prime I can order them when I need to.
These batteries work just as well as the ones you get at the store. They last and you don't have to go get dressed and waste gas to get them. The price is fantastic as well!
"This is the second time I am buying these batteries (for my noise cancellation headphones). No complaints on the product and the packaging is excellent - frustration free, as described."
Was going threw batteries like crazy because I have so many LED candles. Purchased these with the recharable box. But make sure the batteries are Alkline batteries.
"Wonderful price, these seem to be lasting just as long as any other battery we have used."
"Work great, long lasting."
Great product - works exactly as I'd expect!
"Great price, excellent product."
I learned a little late to buy batteries in bulk here. They last a long time and the price is wonderful!
Great product as a great price
"Great product at a fantastic price! I can't even get them this cheap at the local bulk foods store. Just as strong as any other brand name battery. I put it on subscribe and save, so I got an additional discount. I will reorder these when we run low."
"Great product, fast shipping with PRIME, and AWESOME PRICE!!!"
"With more than 35,000 reviews for this product, there is little that I can add to this discussion. But for about 0.25 a battery, these are hard to beat. I have been buying these for years and they never let me down. Great product at a great price. Marc Correra"
Same as purchasing any other brand name batteries. They have lasted as long as any other brand. Love receiving all these non-perishable items in bulk at my front door at a better price than any store without having to carry them or leaving my house.
Great product at very reasonable price!
Long life
"Great product for a great price, you can't go wrong with amazon! I love it!"
"Shipped fast, boxed perfectly and work great and last as long as name brand batteries! Good price good buy :)"
"Still testing but they have outlasted store brands already , I write installed date on each with a marker pin so. Then test replaced ones with a load tester to see what voltage remains."
Love this battery and the price is really reasonable
"These are very nice and very high quality batteries. Batteries are not the most exciting thing in the world - until they die and you don't have any more! I would also like to mention (off topic, sorry) that I had a shipment of these go missing and Amazon was wonderful about replacing them.I will definitely get these again."
"Exactly what it says basic haha, great product not the best, but definitely worth the price."
Great product price
"Great product, and I like the packaging too. Comes in a nice compact box. Easy to store in my cabinet."
"My son uses these on xbox. He was surprised that they had an Amazon label! I told him: great product, easy order! He just loves them--plus, we can recycle them! Thanks, Amazon! Will order again!"
"I have a panasonic portable oral water jet irrigator which eats batteries every few days. The amazon batteries were the perfect solution,praiseworthy, work the same or better than the major brands, and come in a large enough package that I never seem to run out. They are alsoconveniently shrink wrapped in packages of four, so when traveling, it is not necessary to carry a bunch of loose batteries. Great product, great price,"
"Fast shipping, great product!"
"I love AmazonBasics items. For anything they offer, that's what I check for first before looking at any other brands. This is our second order of these batteries and we have them in a couple other sizes as well. They perform as well as the more expensive brands and last just as long. I will definitely be buying them again."
"These batteries are amazing! They are reasonably priced and come packaged in groups of four. My husband has to use batteries out in the field (Military) and he says as long as Amazon sells these and keeps the packaging the same, we will always purchase from them. They last just as long as Duracell and Energizer with the equipment that he uses and since they are packaged in groups of four, it is easier to store them in his pack and not worry about the batteries bursting and leaking into the pack."
These batteries can go up against any big company batteries !!! Amazon is my permanent supply . It's cheap durable and quality
Great price!!!
All of our batts are Amazon now. Great product.
Exactly as advertised! Great product.
Great product at a nice price.
Nothing to be complaint. Great product.
"Excellent purchase, definitely came in handy for Christmas, my kids received lots of toys without batteries lol"
My Amazon insider suggested these. He made a great recommendation.
You cannot get a better battery for the price. Only thing I hate is the packaging.
Great purchase for your money. This brands lasts a long time and I received it double packaged in a timely manner. Definitely will buy these again in the future.
"Great batteries , great price and speeding shipping like always. I was a bit worried because we've always purchased one of the two leading battery brands. These last as long and are super convient to order. This is how we buy are batteries moving forward"
Great buy!!!
Great batteries at an even greater price. Mucho Grassyass.
Amazed at the Amazon Basics quality. And now I can use my Echo to order them!
Work as great as other name brand batteries I've used.
I've used these in an ultrasonic bark control device and they're still going strong. Purchased different sizes of Amazon Basic batteries in bulk and they've all worked well and have been reliable over the past few months. And Amazon has their batteries packaged differently than you find at the store. They come wrapped in plastic in a cardboard box with a lid. It makes them easy to store in the regular box. These were made in Indonesia. Would recommend!
Does what batteries should and battery life is good.
Batteries held up just as well if not better than the name brands. For the price you can't beat it!
Every bit as good as the over priced name brands!
I love these batteries. Cant get a better deal anywhere for the quality. I have ordered them several times and will continue to.
These batteries were a great price ! And they work great
"Seriously, these are great quality batteries at a solid price.Everyone I know gets annoyed with how much I talk about Amazon, now they hate me a little bit more when they see that I have Amazon branded batteries.It appears as those around me are simply annoyed..."
Quality products at a very reasonable price. These are every bit as good as the name brands but at a much better price. They come wrapped in tight plastic packaging so I've never had any corrosion upon delivery.
Great quality for the money. I bought these to replace horrible batteries from Toys R Us. The amazon batteries are great so far.
As expected.
"I perfer these batteries over any others. I used Duracell before, but these seem to work just as well and last the same length of time and are way cheaper. I never buy batteries from the store anymore. These are truly great."
"Great quality, it takes very longer until the battery drain itself. I highly reccomend this amazon basic battery. And i love to get and buy more."
"I have purchased these before, and have always been pleased with their quality, price and performance. Would recommend. And of course, will buy again when I run out."
I'll make it simple. They work great! The bulk pack was worth the buy and all the batteries appear to have a full charge. Just compare prices.
"Cheap price, great quality! I only buy AmazonBasics batteries!"
Great Quality. Amazing Price
Great quality. Love it!
"I mostly buy these for use in the many battery operated toys, etc. my two grandsons have. Their parents welcome both the quanty and quality, and are completely satisfied with both, and if they are satisfied, I am as well."
Great review about this product. I can't wait to use it. Nice packaging with a quick delivery! I am glad to get this items!
I buy Amazon batteries regularly for price and product reliability and never had a problem.
Excellent product
"As described, great service."
We purchased some name brand batteries from Amazon. They turned out to be duds - began corroding very quickly and lost power quickly. They probably were fakes. The pic on Amazon showed manufacturer packaging but we received all of the batteries in a clear plastic carton.These batteries are not name brand but work very well. Devices that did not perform using the name brand batteries began working perfectly once these batteries were installed.If these batteries continue to perform well and have normal lives we will switch all of our battery purchases from name brand batteries to this brand.
Used them to refill window candles and they are great! Packaged well.
"Great that I can order in a large qty. I have 5 kids, 2 leap frogs, 6 battery operated trucks, 5 remote controls and the list goes on and on. So we go thru the batteries like crazy. love the price for the bulk size."
"great value. The batteries last longer than usual equivalents. i'm going to be ordering the other sizes, right now, before i forget."
Received as promised
A great buy!! The seem to last just as long as brand names in the devices I use them in
"Amazing price and they are just as good as the big names in batteries. In fact, one of the big names must make them."
amazing price for pretty good batteries
amazing value
Amazon batteries are high quality.
"At the rate we go through AA batteries (5 grandsons and LOTS of toys), these are a great value."
aThey are good quality and light up my LEDs to a very bright level
Can't go wrong with AmazonBasics batteries - quality at a great value.
Cheaper than my local box store. No complaints. Great value
Fantastic value. This beats going to the store and getting the batteries there. Especially worth it with Prime shipping.
"Feel like I found a great deal and love having back up batteries for my home as well as friends and family. So far I've used about 12 of these in different products - so far so good and honestly, great price/value and if/when I need batteries again, i'll be after these babies"
For camping lanterns. Tested some with battery tester and seem okay. Keeping these in camper trailer.
Good bargain. Better than most low cost batteries actually as good as the best at a fraction of the cost.
Good battery at a good price.
Good deal.
Good quality batteries and cheap. Tend to get through a lot of batteries and these are as good as high end brands.
Great batteries for the money! These beat out Rayovac's and Duracells without a doubt and the price isn't bad either. Comes in an easy to open cardboard box with a small instruction booklet. Each 4 batteries are individually wrapped making it easy to grab a pack and go. Great value.
"Great batteries. Work well, last long and are a great bargain."
Great deal and last. I'm not buying the more expensive ones again. Although most of the time I use my rechargeables
great deal. I always look around first.
"Great quality , best value ! Never going back to brand name"
"Great quality and low cost for all the kids toys that constantly need batteries. I use these over rechargeable because there just more practical for certain types or toys,remotes, controllers to just replace the them"
"Great quality product. I haven't done extensive testing or anything, but they seem to last just as long as Energizer batteries. All of the batteries worked as they should and the value was a good deal."
Great value
Great value
Great Value
great value
Great value
Great value - so far the batteries work just fine. I never notice any difference between these and other brand name batteries.
Great value and exceptionally long lasting.
Great value for the money.
great value for the price
"Great value for the price! When I buy batteries in bulk, I keep them in the fridge!"
GREAT VALUE! My husband and I are so pleased with this product. We were in need of AA batteries and found that these work great at such an amazing value! We will absolutely be ordering all of our batteries through Amazon and using Amazon Basics for other products in the future!
Great value! We go through lots of batteries with game controllers. Amazon comes through on the price and bulk of the batteries!
Great value.
"Great Value. This is a lot of battery here but if you have toddlers and they have toys, you will blow through this in a heartbeat. They work and have a good amount of juice. They haven't leaked yet."
Great value. We did a battery test with a flashlight. Worked as well as name brand batteries.
Have ordered these several times and get good use with them.
I am all about trying to find the best value for my money and these batteries are it. One of my friends was using some amazin batteries in some of her baby toys so I asked about them and she was saying that they hold up just as wel as the Duracell and more expensive mane brand batteries do. I'm hooked! Love these Amazon basic batteries.
"I find this to be the best battery value around. They work as well as the well-known expensive brand, but with the convenience of them being delivered to my house with no shipping cost with Amazon prime."
I hope they last as long as regular batteries. So far they are just as powerful.
"I love Amazon Basics batteries! They cost less than even the cheapest batteries from the dollar store, but they work just as well as the name brands. Best of all, I don't even have to get in my car to purchase them. I always keep plenty of these in my house since my kids' toys just eat up batteries!"
"I purchased these to replace the batteries in my LED motion lights that are used in my basement closet. For the amount of batteries I received compared to the cost, I doubt I'll ever buy the big brands again. I have no complaints."
It's great to have a ready supply of batteries which is one of the reasons I buy these in bulk. They last as long as higher priced batteries.
Love these batteries. They are an amazing price and work wonderfully.
My first order of these. Tested as fully charged. Will buy again.
Nice and cheap last just as long as the expensive ones that claim they last twice as long than the others. Had a few duds from the others and these so no big complaints.
Nice value for these batteries... they all work well and last and the price is perfect! We always have to stock up on batteries for Xmas gifts so this was a great way to do that.
One of the best deals on batteries Ive ever gotten. I feel like they are just about as good as Duracell or Energizer but for this price you cant deny the value. Ill be buying Amazon batteries in bulk like this from now on. It's close enough to the major brands for me to switch and enjoy the value.
Perfect amount for the price.
Pretty good
"Rated by Consumer Reports as recommended, this is a good battery at a great price. True, it does not match the latest Energizer Ultimate Lithium, but that battery is far more expensive. These batteries come packed in a plain brown box, and sealed in clear plastic by twos."
Really good value for the money. There could definitely be less packaging material
So far they seem to last as long as the top brands for a lot less money! I will definitely continue to order these batteries!
So far very satisfied. Only used a couple up to this point.
super cheap in price but not in quality
The best
"Their basic AA batteries. I haven't done any detailed tests, but they seem to be working as well as any Alkaline batters we've purchased before. They are a great value as they are much cheaper per battery than any of the other name brands."
"These are good batteries, Durability equal to the expensive ones"
"These are the only batteries we ever buy, they last just as long as the national brands and the price can't be beat!"
These batteries are a great value last me a long time and it's always so nice to have a bunch of extras for when I need them.
These batteries are awesome for the price. I mostly use them for my flashlights and the tv remote controllers. Met and exceeded my expectations!
"These batteries have held up well. I'm glad I took a chance to try them out. I've not been disappointed with these. As a mom with two young children, we have lots of things that require batteries. I've been converted from the big name batteries to amazon's little gem."
"These batteries last as long as the name brand ones and are a great value. Absolutely a must have around Christmas time, I plan to also purchase the AA pack next time."
"They are cheap and work well, no issues at all. Very pleased with my purchase."
"They do the job at a great price. Also purchase AA, D, 9V all the time for company."
"This item is a great value, I was thinking that they might be cheap and not last as long as the big band names, but they are just as good. They came shrink wrapped in packs of four."
"Very fast shipping arrived when stated., Great value for the price. Thank you"
Well packaged and long lasting.
What a great value! These batteries seem to last as long as any of the other name brand batteries and for such a low price! My husband and I have decided we're going to give boxes of these to our family for Christmas next year!
What a great value. Lasts as long as any other brand name maybe even longer! I will buy again
Work as well as big name brands at a lower price. Highly recommended.
Works just as well as the brand name batteries at a reasonable price.
great value - awesome product.they seem to be holding up as good as any namebrand batteries at a fraction of the price.
"Great batteries , great price , can't go wrong !"
"I chew through AA batteries in many devices, so it was nice to have another option. These seem to last as long as the name brand batteries I've used. No issues with power or life yet!"
"Great value and a great battery. These aren't just the junk Dollar Tree or Ikea batteries, these last like a duracel or energizer. It's great value so it's all we buy for batteries."
These have lasted just as long as other brands we've tried yet at a better price point. We'll be coming back to this brand once we've used up this pack. Great to have some extras on hand with the value pack.
"These batteries are as good or better than the major label brands. Seem to last as long or longer. Great value, too!"
Way to go amazon! These Batteries are great!
"Bought these to go along with my Bose QC25, as they require 1 AAA battery. Have found these to last as well as any other major brand AAA battery in the context of these headphones, so am very happy!"
"Second time ordering these and it probably wont be the last. Very impressed with the run time and the price is right (especially if you are a Prime member.) It's been proven to me over many years both by my own research and feedback from customers that when it comes to branded alkaline batteries the differences between Energerzier, Duracell, Radio Shack, Panasonic Ray-O-Vac and Amazon are so negligible as to make price the real deciding factor"
These batteries are a great value for the price. They work just as well as the known brands like the bunny version. I like that I can get them from Amazon and don't have to remember when I am in the store. This comes in real handy around Christmas time when I am ordering gifts and always seem to need batteries. Thanks Amazon for helping out with my budget.
Bought these for various electronics and so far so good. I use to buy Procells but they seem to not last as long and I wanted to try something different. Amazon seems to make good generic products and I'm happy with these batteries so far.
These batteries are just as good as more expensive brands and are a great deal! I love the Amazon Basics batteries.
"Exactly as described. Packed neatly, arrived on time. It will take a long time to use all of these batteries! I haven't had any issues with the battery life. Work fine!"
Great value for all those batteries! I have been using them with no problems for a couple weeks now. I guess we will see how long they last.
Can't beat the value here.
"Excellent value for money for non-rechargable AA batteries.Cheaper than brand name, but long lasting."
Great value for my business needs!! We go through many batteries at work the price point on these batteries are better than the one's I normally purchase from Staples. The box makes it easier to access and fits in our supply drawer more easily.
"I thought that I would give them a try, and I am surprised that these batteries seem to hold up as well as the 'ole copper tops--a great value. I have now bought my second package of these batteries, because I still like them better than anything else that I have tried. Price, value, and quality considered."
Great value and quality batteries. I have 4 kids and typically go through batteries pretty regularly from all the video game controllers. I found these ones to last just as well as the other name brands for a lot less money. Highly Recommend.
The second batch of these batteries I've purchased. They are every bit as good as the name brands at a MUCH better price point.
Boxed nicely and great value for the money!
Great value for the money. Batteries seem to work well and don't appear to be of any lesser quality or power than the traditional alkaline I purchase at the grocery store or drugstore. Highly recommend.
"Great value for the price. these work basically the same as the Duracell I used to use, but they are so much cheaper!"
So glad I tried these batteries. They work great and are much less expensive than what I can find in my local stores.
Used some tonight. great value for the price and did as well as other batteries.
What can I say These batteries have a great price point and arrive when they say they will. They also hold charge and last longer than most batteries in this price range. I've ordered AA and AAA and am not disappointed.
These batteries are a real steal when compared to store bought. Much more value when compared to free shipping from Amazon. Would order them again in a heart beat.
Great for childrens' toys! Long lasting and well priced.
Great price on a value pack. Battery life is OK. Use for Wii remotes. Lasts long enough for your moneys worth.
Can't go wrong with a good value on high quality batteries. I love AmazonBasics for helping me save money. Batteries are great quality and price!
"great price comes in neat four batteries per package, I recommend this product"
"I purchased these a little while back. We go through batteries pretty fast in my house and I think that these are just as good as most batteries that I am willing to pay for. The price was right and that is the biggest factor for me when it comes to choosing batteries.I would recommend these to others, but at the same time.. if you are used to duracell batteries or another popular brand, these may not be right for you. You may consider buying them and comparing them directly to duracell and determining if the cost effectiveness is better with these or the duracell.Hopefully this helps you to make an informed decision. I will continue to buy these batteries myself.I would give it a 5 star review if the batteries lasted a bit longer."
"I've been purchasing various sizes of these AmazonBasics batteries for a while now, they're a great value in comparison to other brands. We are often using these in fairly mundane ways---remote controls, small flashlights, toys---but have also had success with them in game controllers that commonly drain batteries really quickly.One bonus with these AAs: they are shrink-wrapped 4 to a pack within the larger box. This makes it really convenient to toss a 4-pack in a purse, backpack, or glove compartment: no loose batteries rolling all around, and you know all 4 are the same age when you pop open the plastic wrap."
"These batteries last as long as the more expensive ones, such as Duracell or Energizer. I will definitely buy again!"
These are really high quality batteries. I am very happy with my purchase!
I see no difference in performance than Duracell. We loaded two of these in one xBox controller at the same time as we loaded the last of our Duracells in a different xBox controller. My sons always play Minecraft together on split screen. The Amazon batteries have outlasted the Duracells for over a week now with similar usage patterns.
"Bought these for an APRS unit mounted on my motorcycle. Eight batteries worked flawlessly for almost 6 hours of constant tracking, and still have plenty of charge to go on."
"These work just as well as the Duracell and Energizer, and last just as long, but at a fraction of the price. They arrived in a small cardboard box, and were shrink wrapped in groups of four, so they're easy to open, and easy to throw into camera bags, backpacks, gloveboxes, etc without dealing with bags or rubberbands."
"These AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries are a great quality and superior value. The batteries last as long as other name brand batteries, but at a much more cost-effective value. I have used other off-brand batteries and have been disappointed in their battery life, but these batteries don't disappoint. Great if you have kids with toys that take batteries and need to have a lot on hand!"
"Can't review life expectancy yet, haven't had them long enough, but I tested every one and they were all fresh/full power."
Fantastic value for the money and work great. I don't see any difference in performance vs. Duracell or other brands.
"Great batteries for cheap! Much better than any off brands for a similar price. Last about as long as the name brands, and the bulk amount is nice as well."
"Great batteries for the price! I mostly use batteries for simple things like my wireless mouse and keyboard. However, they seem to have pretty decent battery life in toys too."
Great batteries! I would definitely recommend!
Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good
Great price! They work fine!
"Great value, great battery life!"
Great value!
"Great value...and so far, quality holds up."
"I hate going to the store to buy batteries feeling like I might have to mortgage the house for a 4 pack. Ok, so maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get my point. This large pack of batteries by Amazon Basics is a lot easier on my wallet and they seem to be on par with all the other name brand batteries I've purchased in the past."
I'm shocked at how long these cheap batteries last (mainly in LED candles). Great for items that don't use a lot of energy.
It's always nice to have batteries on hand and these last. Great value!
It's worth the price to avoid big box stores.
The batteries last as long as name brand. Great value!!!
They really do the trick. Great value!
This many batteries get very expensive at the store. These are an amazing value. If you use a lot of batteries or just want to have some laying around for when your xbox 360 remote dies these are the ones to get.
Work as well as any other battery...IMHO!
Work as well as any others at a much better price!**If you found this review helpful please click the appropriate box. Thank you!
Great Value! A great Idea for a stocking stuffer if there are a lot of battery operated toys under the tree!
"Great Batteries! I've used them for several different things, and they perform well. I am very happy with the purchase."
Great value! I purchased these to go with XMAS gifts that I gave to my staff.
We have ordered these many times and love them. We have them on subscribe and save and get them regularly. They are a great price and they work great!
Great Value! work just as good and last just as long as the most expensive AA batteries i've purchased.
I definitely feel that I got my money's worth with this purchase!
Decided to give these a try and I am very happy with them. I have not noticed any difference in how long they last. Great price and when you add free shipping its an awesome deal!
Great delivery time and was so happy to get these. So much more affordable than store bought batteries. Soon as I got them I put them in 2 different remotes and all worked fine! Would definitely recommend these to anyone!
You can never have enough AAA batteries !!!
As advertised. Is what it is. Great value.
Great basic battery pack for the price.
Great value.
"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far."
These are the cheapest AAA alkaline batteries you can find. Great value.
These batteries hold up as well as the name brand ones and these are at a much greater value.
These batteries last quite long. Great value.
They are low cost and perform well. Great value.
great value. a toss up between these and Duracell Procell bulk batteries for value. I will buy whichever is cheapest. 1.60 volts and long life
Great Value. Batteries last!
These batteries are awesome for kids toys that don't have moving parts and only music. Also works great in remotes and things like that. Great value for what you get. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
I really don't see any noticeable difference from these batteries compared to the name brands. We have been using the Costco brand volume pack. These batteries are a great value.
Great value. Performs as expected.
Great value. We go through a lot of batteries and these were a great price and held up to the competition.
shipped quickly and arrived spot on time with the gift that required batteries that were not included......Such a life saver when shipping a gift that needs batteries!
I was a little surprised how large a portion of these batteries measured as dead or low out of the box. I did not notice at first but a few batteries in some would last all of a day on low power items. I am currently sitting on 25 dead or extremely low.
"What can I say Great price for double A's which I always need around! Not sure what the life is, but I was buying batteries at IKEA and I can't imagine these would be much different and the price was great. I'm a big fan of Amazon Basics!"
"I seriously don't think I will buy these from the store ever again. These are half the price, and work well in all of my electronics."
"Very good batteries that seem to last a lot longer than standard AAA batteries, I would assume this is due to the Japanese technology used to enable better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures. Would highly recommend at this price!"
"Great, thanks!"
"Many, great, very cheap"
Good product!
Great price. The batteries are the same quality as other big brands.
"Great product, great value. Ships quickly and reasonable price. Saves money in the longrun. I purchase these routinely for the motion lights under the counters and in closets. Note: They can't be re-charged."
"Great value and holds up just as well, ifnnot better than name brand! Our household has switch to amazon basic as our new household brand for batteries."
Great!
Great!
"I use these for remotes, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers, even after I get a low battery warning they still work a VERY long time and I can not tell any difference between these and more expensive brands. I will be buying more of these and possibly moving over to the rechargeable ones."
"Inexpensive, reliable, and long lasting. These are pretty much the only batteries I'll buy anymore."
Just as good as the name brand batteries for a better price!
Long lasting great product
Love Amazon brand anything - had no idea they did batteries too! What can I say they're batteries! They seem to last a long time.
Love these compared to the big brands. I have these on hand at all times. They seem to last just as long as the more expensive options. Buying in bulk just pays for itself in convenience IMO.
So far no issues. They're great batteries. They're such a good deal that after I got these I replaced the batteries in every device I own that uses batteries (to avoid old batteries corroding and destroying anything). So far dozens of devices (from flashlights to remotes) have been working perfectly. Very happy!
These are great! work just as good as the expensive name brand
Unbeatable price for this battery quality. Easily last as long as the Duracell and such and is much cheaper. Won't buy batteries anywhere else anymore
Will purchase again!
work great!
Work great. Seems like the life is similar to Duracell. Love the packaging. I'll be ordering more of all the other sizes to stock up.One suggestion for Amazon: print or stamp in big letters all over the little box the batteries come in what size they are.
"You can't go wrong with Amazon Basics, in my experience."
You get the bang for your buck!
Great! Now always have some when Grandkids come from out of state.
Great Batteries and a fantastic price!!
Great batteries... Great deal!!! Woo hoo Amazon !!
Very great quality and quantity for the low price. Would definitely repurchase!
Affordable and awesome! These are a must for me!
"Long lasting battery, great price! What more could I ask for"
All good.
Duh. Great.
Great batteries for all my toys.
Great batteries. Why pay more for other brands
I haven't actually done any performance testing but I feel that these batteries last just as long as coppertops. I'm happy.
"great. seems like a well made battery, great price. amazon had super fast overnight shipping."
Great Job -- Super Service..!!
Great product.
Has been lasting for a long time. Never bought batteries in bulk like this before but I'm glad I did. Packaged well and is sealed in 3s in a box. I plan on purchasing more in the near future. I recommend it.
They work great used all of them in 2 min on all my Kids GEOtrax trains.
"While these batteries usually meet my expectations, I had a dud that drove a clock for only 1 week, which is about 51 weeks less than I expected. I will still buy again as the price is right."
I was very surprised as the batteries I got were in date but didn't work very long compared to a generic AA drug store variety. Probably just got a bad batch but I ended up replacing them very quickly in remotes especially.
By far the worst batteries I have ever bought I regret my purchase of 2 packs! Half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life! If u found this helpful please rate helpful thanks!
some are not functioning
I got these batteries on Amazon Prime Day and I thought I got a good deal but half of them don't work!!! Very disappointed.
Half the batteries didn't work!
Half the batteries had no charge.
The number of batteries for the low price hands down an excellent cost effect deal
Best bang for the buck on lot of batteries! Check out the Youtube review on my Jay Rule channel: AmazonBasics AAA Alkaline Batteries (36 Pack)
Great value. Love having on hand.
Worked very well but I did not compare power density to other alkaline bateries
"Seems to work well I haven't been using them long, but have not had any problems"
They work and the price was right. Well done Amazon
Haven't used them long so I'm not sure how long they last. So far happy with purchase. Will continue to use. Great prices.
Work as described. Happy with purchase
"Arrived on time and so far they are holding just as good as the more expensive name brands out there, I will buy these again."
"Well-packaged, good value, and functional!"
"Overall, happy with the product. They work well."
Nice battery. Seems to work and last as long as the major name brands. Good deal.
Long lasting batteries and great price!
They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.
Nice!
"Have only installed a couple at this time. I have had other batteries brands that would last, but has acid leaks that sometimes damaged items."
"I have to change my mouse batteries and keyboard batteries like every two weeks with these..... before it was every few months.... horror story... constantly get ... mouse not connected , keyboard not connected ......sometimes starts within a few days....... going to pay more for the name brands"
have you ever needed some double A batteries well look no further!
Don't know if it's my camera or the batteries but they seem to run down pretty quickly
These seem to work well. Haven't used them for too long but they were a good price.
Thanks.
They are batteries. They work. Price is good. Haha not much else to say!
Having children that love electronics we always seems to be going through batteries. We have these on subscribe and save and it has worked out great. The batteries are comparable to any of the major brands in quality and performance. Great product overall.
Yea. Batteries. What can ya say. Ya can't miss with AmazonBasics.
Good
Another way Amazon makes my life easier!
An outstanding deal - just as good as an Energizer in terms of performance for a fraction of the cost.
"AmazonBasics delivers as it always does, high quality AA batteries at a much lower cost than competitors. Thank you AmazonBasics 3"
"Whenever I need a product that I can be confident in without doing tons of research, I look for Amazon basics. These batteries rival Duracell 'professional' and Energizer 'Industrial' alkaline batteries in quality and endurance. I use them in my photography business and they never fail."
High quality batteries at an excellent price. Will buy again when needed.
These last the longest
"I get as good or better performance with these batteries as I do with any name brand batteries, but these are far less expensive, even compared to bulk packages in stores. I use a lot of batteries, so these were a great find! I love that the batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of four, thus making it easy to carry back-up batteries on-the-go. I have purchased these multiple times and will purchase again."
High quality batteries at a great price. They are comparable to duracell and come in a box with packs of four.
"I have bought several products from the Amazon basics line of products and continue to be impressed with everything they have made. The batteries are as you would expect AA size batteries to be. They have a good weight to the batteries, not like cheap dollar store batteries.They seem to power all my devices, including high current devices well. So far they have not leaked or cause any problems. I feel for the price you cannot beat the quality of these batteries.I would recommend the purchase of these batteries."
"The battery is great, and the price is reasonable too."
"Great batteries here! These last just as long as Duracell or Energizer, but you get way more for your money! I mostly use these for video game controllers and remote controls. They last as long as I expect and I have never had a bad (dead) one. I don't understand why anyone would pay more for the expensive brands. These are NOT dollar store batteries. High quality and durability with a price that lets me always have spares ready to go! Since I found these I have been ordering them over and over in multiple sizes."
Just as good as Duracell. Would highly recommend for anyone living on a budget.
"These batteries are high quality and inexpensive. I bought this pack to primarily use in toys like nerf guns. I was slightly concerned about buying a brand that I had never used before especially for a birthday party (even if it has Amazon's name on it).When I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised. They have a decent weight to them. This is generally how you can tell the difference between cheap batteries and high-quality batteries. The heavier they are the liner they will last.After using these batteries for a Nerf battle birthday party to power large Nerf guns and throughout Christmas, I'm hooked. I have enrolled in a Subscribe and Save plan on Amazon which allows for an additional discount to have them delivered periodically.I would definitely recommend these batteries to anyone for whatever battery needs they may have. They are high- quality, inexpensive, Amazon.com backed batteries. There really isn't much of a risk."
"Fortunately, very satisfied with the quality, despite the low price."
"So far, every Amazon basic product that I have used has been comparable to any other brand name (at a much better price)."
I don't think I could run out of batteries now. Why buy name brand when these batteries have relatively the same life span and can save your wallet a ton. Highly recommend stocking up here as opposed to blowing through your cash at a convenience store spending twice the money for a pack of 6.
FAST DELIVERY ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
"It's a bargain! Works just as well as regular, higher priced batteries for a fraction of a cost. Highly recommend!"
Great value. Great price. Long lasting.
"Item as described, very fast shipper, highly recommend."
Great batteries at a great price.
Can't beat the price!
Great batteries for the price
Awesome product and quality!!
"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems."
"Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be duds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why..."
"I'm not sure if these are the same Amazon Basics batteries I purchased last time, the label is different. More importantly these seem to discharge faster or hold less power. I buy the 48 count box usually and its obvious to me already this box will last maybe half the time the last box did."
Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.
Great price and can't tell a difference between these and more expensive brands. I buy again and again in every size :)
They powered my stuff. Amazing!
Great batteries. They last a good while.
"Honestly, I don't think I'll buy batteries anywhere else. If Amazon keeps making these batteries same quality, and same price, I'll just keep reordering them here. No brainer."
"These are batteries, what can you say about batteries. I mean they power stuff and were packaged like batteries are. I am impressed that Amazon has their own battery product. No complaints. Because they are batteries. Uhhhhh.........yeah."
Would buy again in a heart beat. These seem to be lasting as long as our name brand batteries in our under cabinet lights but 1/3 the cost.
These are batteries what else can one say did anyone get silver batteries instead of white Hopefully they will be better than the previous version.
What a deal! And finally I will not run out of batteries! What a great idea... a 100 of them!
Got these for the price point - rechargeables don't hold up as well or long as I'd like - really hate disposables but until the make a Nuclear AA battery that runs for 25 years or longer and costs under 5 these will have to do. Yet to see if they last as long as the higher price Bunnies.
"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free."
"Very unhappy with these batteries. Used them for my flame-less candles, 3 batteries in each. I use a remote to turn the candles on, so they were only on a few hours at a time AND only a few nights a week. Died in less than 3 WEEKS!"
"I suppose the most honest thing about them is in their name...BASIC!! I use them in my blood pressure monitor. I take my BP twice a day and it only takes about 10 seconds. The batteries only last about 6 weeks. I've also used them in my air conditioner remote which I might use once or twice a day, just to turn it on or off. Again, after about 5 - 6 weeks, they stop working. They are also used in my Alexa/Echo remote which is used more often, yet, they last about 3 months in it. This is the first Amazon labeled/made product that I have bought that was not rated a 5. Don't buy these if you are looking for a long lasting battery."
"Horrible, do not buy.I bought these in AA and AAA and they all lasted just a few days. My battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesn't take long before they stop working."
"Horrible! Did not last 1 hour, in my devices. DO NOT BUY!!"
"Batteries were horrible. As soon as I would put a pair in my Amazon Fire stick remote, I'd get a message that batteries were low. After a day or 2 I couldn't even wake the Fire stick up because the batteries were dead. Went through the hole pack in 2 weeks."
Went on sale 4 days later for 14.40 for 100 batteries. I paid 12.49 for 48 batteries. Hosed again.
I absolutely love Amazon Spring end I never have any complaints they always stand behind their products although it's never needed because their products are normally made very well with quality materials I only buy my batteries off Amazon no I will not pay the price in the store as I find Amazon's batteries last approximately the same as like Energizer or Duracell and thieves Amazon basic brand batteries are probably half that price
I actually like them I see some people saying they don't like them but they actually work really good for me. I use them for my xbox one controller I play a lot. the first ones I used lasted pretty long I can't tell you how long exactly but it had to be around 6 or 7 days playing for about 3 sometimes 4 hours a day so I'd say that's pretty good. Im using my second ones now still pretty good so 5 stars all the way for me
"I always put new batteries in my three thermostats at the beginning of the heating season in late Sept to make sure they work through the winter. Never had a problem with Energizer or Duracell going the whole year. These batteries from Amazon all had to be replaced in February, won't be using them again."
I always stock up on disposable batteries and I like trying new brands every now and then. This is my first purchase of Amazonbasics and so far I have no complaints to give. I like the simple package it came in. The battery seems to hold it's own in comparison to other brands. Is it the best well I'm no battery expert but I will say for the pricing it does an excellent job. Great value.
I am a professional photographer and have these as backup for flash. kids steal them for their gaming.. they work and last the same as every name brand.
Have installed some of the batteries in two devices and are working well I am completely satisfied with their performance.
I am disappointed with the quality of these batteries. I used them to light some low voltage decoration lights on the ceiling of my bus. They only lasted 1 day. Replaced with Energizer batteries and I am in my 2 week and they are still going strong.
"I posted an entire review about the C batteries but I will reiterate here. I was once scared of the generic battery. I was scared that if I did not use the name brand, super expensive battery that I would be doing a disservice to whatever toy or electronic I was putting them in. This is not the case with these batteries. I know that there are batteries out there that are generic and have not worked as well but I am here to vouche for these batteries. I have been using them in everything and bought all the different kinds because of how well they worked and the value. The value for this amount of batteries and the quality of these batteries cannot be beat anywhere else. They have outlasted the expensive kinds in my daughters toys and in the things that I have placed them in around the house. I have not been disappointed and I was floored by the price. I do not mean to prattle on but I cannot say enough about these toys. As it gets closer to Christmas, parents all around are stocking up on batteries, I know I am. I have bought a pack of AAA, AA, and C just for Christmas. I could not believe the savings and you will not be disappointed with the quality. I am now an advocate for Amazon batteries. They do not disappoint!"
These batteries have kept things going at our house. I am pleased with them and order them regularly.
I am satisfied the batteries I recieved are just as good as any other name brand batteries that you could buy.
"Amazon Basics. I am so glad these are part of the basics. I love these batteries. I get equal or better performance as you might expect from Duracel or Energizer. The benefit is that I pay less. Every single time I walk past batteries in a store I think, Amazon Basics and then like Vector from Despicable Me, I can hear, Oh YEAH!"
We use many batteries. I am so happy to be able to replace them without driving to the store
"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again."
"I am very disappointed in these batteries. They do not work, or if they do work it is only for a few minutes. They are a waste of money."
I needed batteries and after having read and seen so many positive reviews I bought my first batch of Amazon Basics batteries. I was an Energizer girl and was very skeptical of trying another brand as other attempts proved unworthy. I am very pleased by the quality endurance of these batteries! I started with AAA and they worked so well that I bought AA when I needed more. The price can't be beat either! These batteries serve their purpose well and last a long time - the best bang for the buck that I have found!
I am very pleased with the life span of these batteries. I've used them on a variety of gadgets and they're still going strong.
arrived fast. I believe one of the batteries was defective but still overall good quality.
Not a long life at all. I bought AA batteries in the same order and they work fine.
I bought the 20 pack in September 2015. Half of the batteries in the package do not work. Do not purchase.
I bought these batteries for my Fitbit scale and installed them as soon as they arrived. Typically I have to change the batteries every 6-8 months but I have already had to replace these. I won't be buying them again.
Out of every package so far only 2 batteries are working. I bought these in April so they should still all be good and I'm finding I need to throw most of them away. I wish I could still return them.
I bought these to use in the wireless mouse I bought at same time. I seem to have to change the batteries to often.
You can never go wrong with Inexpensive batteries that are delivered right to your door and last just as long if not longer than the national brands. From cameras to flash lights and toys these batteries last the test of time.
It is great having these around.
Fabulously made product. I didn't expect excellent quality from an Amazon-branded battery. Will be purchasing more in the future. Can't beat the prices either!!!!!!!!
"Since I have bought these batteries, I do not feel like I am changing batteries as often as I were before using Rayovak. I will say however they do not last more than a couple days of hard play on the XBOX one controllers."
I DO NOT recommend purchasing these batteries they barely last 24 hrs in what lasts 2 weeks with Costco or Duracell or Energizer brands.
These have a very short life. I do not recommend this brand
They perform like name brand batteries for the cost of a smaller back of name brand batteries. Thanks.
So far so good
I don't know who made these batteries but they are worthless. They do not hold a charge.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.
I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.
The batteries are as described and arrived on time. I especially like the way they are sealed in packs of 4 - no worries about corrosion.
Can't go wrong. I feel like I'll be all set for AAA batteries for a while!
Such a good price and solid performance!
"I found these batteries great, shipped on time, as advertized, good expiration dates, well packaged. I am puzzled by Amazon's refusing to ship more while investing what it claims are reports of problems. The reviews show overwhelmingly postive responses with 5 negative. I see Amazon happily offering many products with far worse stats. What is the story here When will the 'investigation' be over (Should the FBI be called in ) )"
"I gave these battereis a perfect score because they look all right, but how can I know for sure I just got them."
Never have so many done so much for so long and so little. I am a big fan of amazon basics and these batteries haven't disappointed. It is nice to have a bunch of them in the cabinet. I haven't scientifically measured the life span of them but the last long enough that I am satisfied with their quality.
"I got these batteries for my wireless mouse, which I leave on all the time because I forget to turn it off. I don't have to change the batteries often, so they hold a decent charge."
"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing"
"I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services. Unfortunately, either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other brands. These were ordered in April and it is now August and I have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse. Normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months. I would not recommend. Others reviews are more positive, but I personally cannot recommend this brand."
I had ordered these because the Duracell batteries I ordered did not hold up during storage. I found that these batteries had a longer running time and so far they are holding up during storage. The Duracell batteries broke and became corroded. This is dangerous to anyone. My hope is that Amazon has higher standards and safety regulations than the Duracell plant that produced my other batteries. The Amazon batteries were packaged in four battery parcels.
I had to buy a brand new bed after purchasing this item. It kept ripping up and the bugs kept coming from the tears in the case. I do not recommend this for no one.
These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed
"It's a bunch of batteries, I have always had good luck with these batteries, All I know is you put them into the device it works"
"I have been purchasing batteries from Amazon for some time now, we have them in both our homes as our grandchildren seem to always have toys that need them. Amazon batteries last as long if not longer than other battery brands and they are quite a bit cheaper. Thanks Amazon"
I have been using Amazon Basics products for about 2 years and have always found them to be first rate. The batteries last as long as the name brand batteries and cost a lot less.
Delivered on time. I have been using these products for quite a while now worked great and a great deal for the price.
"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packaging, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn't used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I'm not going to be buying again. I could forgive one leaking battery, but almost half the package I'll either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality, or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money"
These seem to work out well for me. Battery checker device confirms full charge when they arrive and they last in my electronics an expected about of time. I have continued to buy and have been satisfied. They seem fresher that the store bought equivalents
I have had these only for a week I cannot tell you anymore
"I have never been so disappointed with a product. The battery life is horrible. When used in my camera, I can get maybe five standard-non zoom pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced. When used in tv remotes, the battery life is maybe a week. It is the same with the Amazon AAA batteries too. I will not be repurchasing again."
"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work."
These do the craziest thing. I put them into stuff that needs batteries and then the thing works. Great price and quantity.
They are batteries. They don't seem to last any longer or shorter than the average battery. I've bought them before and will buy again.
I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again. The 'life' on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired.
"So far lasting well, and I like the packaging, makes a good storage container."
I haven't really kept track meticulously but these batteries don't seem to last as long as Kirkland brand or Duracell.
"I was buying Duracell ProCell batteries for years as the normal Duracell and Energizer batteries didn't seem to last (mostly use them in my electric shaver), but these Amazon batteries have been more impressive than the ProCell batteries. Such a bargain. I highly recommend you try the generics too."
"I waited until I had tried these out for awhile before I wrote this review, I read plenty of positive and negative, but for the price I desided to give them a try. I cut grass with a radio head set, I like listening to music vs. my 25hp mower engine. I've done this for several years, I usually change the batteries out about every 6 weeks, these lasted about 7 weeks. I know that's not the typical scientific review you see from some with how many volts after how many hours, but I'm just giving you a real world review, these are just as good, if not better, than the name brand batteries I purchased in the past. But a lot cheaper. Hope this helps you make your decision."
I was a little hesitant to not get name brand batteries but so far the batteries I've used have been working. I like that the price is lower than elsewhere too.
I like the batteries. Seem as good as the main brands - However I do not understand why amazon has to use such wasteful packaging in a bulk box. Why pack it in sets of 4 when package is a box. It does not serve any role and just adds to landfills.
"I like the heavy card board box they come in. The strength (AAA, AA, C, etc) is printed on the side of the box. This gives you the ability to stack your batteries in a common 'emergency equipment' location so you know where to go when you need one. With the plainly marked sides, you can instantly see which box you want. This will gladly replace our current system: open a package of batteries, take 1 or 2, then put the rest back - someplace. We have batteries all over the place: some in in baggies, some loose in drawers, some still in their original packaging."
Batteries seem to be very high quality. I like the price and the packaging.
"Decided to give Amazon Batteries a try...so far, so good.I've purchased them 4 times and will continue."
No issues with these batteries they work just as well (or better) than the more expensive ones I will buy again
I've purchased several of the Amazon Basics battery. No need for a lengthy review. They work as expected and are cheap.
"Iam done with Cheap Batterys,, these came holding over 1.6v,,,, on my list to buy again"
The batteries work just as good as as other for a better price.
Great product!
I love AmazonBasics!!!!
I love AmazonBasics. With all the electronics devices we have in the home its nice to have a good quantity of these in the house. I would recommend amazonbasics to anyone.
"My Wife said we were out of batteries. I asked Alexa to order them and they arrived two days later. We used some immediately and they performed as expected so far. Need a little run time to verify their longevity, but I suspect they meet as advertised at least."
I love buying my batteries on Amazon because they are so much cheaper and they work just as well. It's nice to always have some on hand and I don't have to worry about forgetting to buy them at the store. These batteries are of great quality and come highly recommended. Some of my friends have stopped buying batteries at the store and I've proudly converted them to the AmazonBasics batteries.
"I love having a box of these. They are packed in bundles of 4. This makes them a lot less mess. They seem to last just as long as other big name brands, and are cheaper. They are in the drawer, with a box of AA and 9v. All in their own boxes and easy to grab and get some out. No more ziplock bag full of random batteries."
As good as the copper ones for much less money. I got tired of paying through the nose for small packages of batteries at my local Wally World. It is nice to have a brick of batteries available. I actually used up half the box just getting everything stocked with new batteries. I liked them so much that I ordered the AAA and D cell boxes. As long as Amazon keeps making quality products for less money they will continue to take over the world.
I love how efficiently Amaozon packages their batteries. They seem to hold up comparably to other name brand batteries. Also they are so inexpensive!
"I love Amazon Prime! My son needed some batteries for a device so I opened the Amazon App, voice searched for AAA batteries and about 36 hours later, I had batteries in my hand!"
"I love the fact that you can get such a nice quantity of batteries for such a low price. Huge savings over big-box and grocery stores, and with a family of 4 kids and their army of battery-hungry toys, this deal is a life-saver."
"I love the volume price, but these batteries don't seem to last as long as the Dollar General alkaline batteries I typically purchase."
These have some major juice! I love them! Long lasting and a kick-bootie price!!
Great Batteries. They last a long time.
I love these
I love these batteries! This is my first time purchasing amazon batteries and am very impressed! They last very long and are super cheap! Will be ordering my batteries from amazon from now on! I have learned that anything amazon basics is great if not better than the normal name brand items. Would recommend!
"I love these batteries. I haven't tested them side by side, but I do not feel like I am changing them anymore frequently than the duracell we used to use, and these are less expensive."
"I bought these at the same time as my AA batteries. They have a lot of power and last a long time, despite my extended use."
"I love these little lights! Quick and easy! Snap the batteries in, attach the double sided sticky tab on the back and place it where you need it. I actually bought them for our dog, Jynger, because she wouldn't go down the stairs to the basement doggy door at night because she couldn't see the stairs and I don't like to leave a light on all night. Works perfect! I will be buying more for other places in the house."
"I love these! I have them in black and the coral. Very comfortable. I wouldn't workout in them as the waistband is not snug, but do wear them around the house and when out running errands. Lightweight and wearable on warmer days."
"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC"
"Don't know a whole lot about batteries, but these are cheap and they work"
"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer."
"I keep asking my boss for AAA batteries and he always comes back with three. We have walkie-talkies at work and need these suckers by the palate. After RadioShack shut down next door, it was sort of inconvenient getting more mid-shift, and he was being stingy, so I finally just bought a box and dropped it on his desk. Think he gets it now."
I need to cancel this auto shipment
"I needed batteries for my kittens toys. The first three I used lasted only 5 hours!! I am so unhappy, I spent 8 which is a lot of money for me."
I never knew Amazon had such good value on batteries! We use these for everything from remotes to Xbox one Controllers.They seem to last as long as any other name brand battery.
They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it! They are awful!!!
"I never tested them for output, but based on experience they appear to work just as well as any other batteries we purchased in past, and price is better"
"I normally buy the Maxwell brand but thought I'd give these a try. I used them in my led battery operated lights, they were dead in half the time of the Maxwells."
I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I bought these instead (Aug. 2016) as they were cheaper. I just today had to remove a set of these from a remote thermometer and they had leaked even though the date printed on the batteries was Jan. 2025. My savings on these cheaper batteries was far less than the cost of my now damaged thermometer.
"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss."
"I purchased these batteries for my boyfriend . The split open and ruined who uses them in a 200.00 portable modem. I would of sent them back, but this happened after the 30 day return window."
I purchased these for my daughter for camp and open a pack today and they did not work. Fresh out of the plastic wrap and everything:(.
"I purchased these for the office as everyone has an Apple mouse that uses AA batteries. I found myself changing batteries on my mouse almost every month with these batteries. Yes they work, but not for long. We purchased these in September and we blew through these in 2.5 months with 16 employees. With Duracell batteries, which I purchased again, they last much longer, several months instead of just one month."
I put several of these in my mouse battery and had to replace them after only a few days. Will not be buying more.
The price was right and now I have to wait and see how long these batteries will last. I read some good reviews on this product but I have yet to render a final decision.
"I really like Amazon batteries. I think they work just as well as any of the other brands, but at a much better price point."
Never enough of these in the house. I really like the bulk purchase and have them handy option.
I really like these AA Performance Alkaline Batteries. They last longer. We use these in our grandsons remote control cars and they last much longer than some of the other brands that we've purchased in the past..
I received a lot of batteries for very inexpensive. This is the best deal on batteries I've ever found
They're perfect and I have to mention the price is great
"I have ordered these twice now. Every gadget and game my son has seems to need AA batteries. I can't give technical info about their capabilities compared to others, but I can say I did not go through them any faster than the name brand sets. The biggest battery sucker in our house being video game controllers. They seem to last at least as long, perhaps slightly longer. I recommend for the average user."
I haven't noticed any different between these batteries and Duracell or Energizer. Perhaps they're lasting a little longer. I recommend this product!
I was hesitant to buy anything but the big name brands in batteries. I took a chance for the value in Amazon batteries and I have been pleasantly surprised! I should have bought this a long time ago.
"I still have not found an alkaline battery that outlasts a Duracell, but for the price, these are hard to beat. They've managed quite well in both an LED lamp and a wireless computer mouse. I'll be purchasing them again, for sure."
"Until lately 99 of the AA and AAA batteries I bought were Duracell brand. Its not that Ive found any brand to be that much better or that much worse than another but I tend to stick with what works for me. And for those things that I use disposable batteries in (I try to use rechargeables whenever I can) Duracells seem to work out the best. And they are the brand that the membership store sells so I can get them at a reasonable price whenever Im shopping for supplies.I took a chance on buying Amazon Basics brand for a couple of reasons. One is that Ive had good luck with the Amazon Basics brand I dont think Amazon is going to mess up their reputation selling junk. One strong factor is that these claim to be made in Japan, and Japanese-made batteries from Panasonic, Sony, Maxell and other major name brands have a good reputation. But the 1 reason I tried these is price. They are 10-15 cents less PER BATTERY than what Ive been buying and it doesnt make sense to me to pay more if Im not getting any more.These have an overall feeling and look of being made pretty well. Its easy to spot a cheap no-name battery and these are definitely better. They are bulk packed, which is great, why pay more for fancy packaging on something as mundane as a battery And theyre fresh you know thats going to be true with Amazons immense daily turnover of product. If you are reading the reviews, be aware that Amazon has been making regular upgrades to this battery, so something reviewed a year ago is probably long obsolete by now. The biggest change I understand is the shelf life of the newest formulation is now rated at 10 years. I dont really care, theres no way a box of batteries is going to sit on my shelf for 10 years but it does mean that when I get to the 48th battery out of a package of 48 it probably will be nearly as fresh as the first one in the pack.I havent been able to see any downsides, and I do like saving money that would be wasted for fancy packaging and expensive advertising, so unless something drastically changes I believe these will now be my brand of choice."
Don't seem to last long. I think dollar general batteries are just as good.
I have purchased other Amazon Basics batteries. These are my first AA's. They work just like the other ones do. I am not an electrical engineer so I can't give you an engineering report. All I can tell you is that I like them. I like buying batteries in large quantities and I like that they come in a nice box for storage.
I think these batteries are better than the ones I would buy at the store. Better quality but also better price for the amount. I bought these AAA and the AA.
I've tried a lot of different batteries for my headlamps and they seem to last the longest and have the lowest price on a per battery basis. I have been using the Amazon batteries for about six months now. I guess the battery can never last as long as I think it should last so I gave it the four stars for that reason.
"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."
WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
I used to get the Sony bulk package of the AA batteries but when I saw this deal I couldn't pass it up without giving it a try. I use a lot of batteries with my 3 dslr flashes triggers so this is a great deal for me
I use batteries for low drain electronics like hand held GPS. Tested these against Duracell copper tops and was surprised that the Amazon Basics last longer than Duracell. 24 hours vs 21. Not a huge difference but they are 1/2 the price:)
I use LOTS of batteries and these are the best bargain out there. Seem to last as long as Duracell and much longer than the other major name brands.
"Cheap AAA batteries! Haven't had any issue with them so far, I use them in stuff like... my nose hair trimmer."
I use these for all the remotes in my house. They're competitively priced and hold a charge as well as any others I've purchased. Definitely my go-to battery of choice now.
"I use these on my Xbox one controllers. For the price they are quite a steal. I haven't really noticed a difference in battery life over other batteries. They get the job done, and I will definitely be using these batteries for the foreseeable future"
I use this mostly for my thermostat and it seems to last me about 3 weeks or so. I kind of expected it to last at least a month.
I haven't heard any complaints of longevity or strength from the teens who use them for video gaming controllers. They seem to be comparable to the other name brands and dutifully serve their purpose. I used a couple in our favorite dancing decor for Halloween. It's been a month and Frankenstein is still shaking his hips like the first day I put the batteries in.
I used them for christmas decoration and by the end of christmas the batteries leaked . will not get them again
I used these batteries with my LED lights. It works but it doesn't last long. I used Duracell batteries the same price last much longer.
Never disappointed.
Perfect!
"I was a little hesitant to order these because they were not a name brand. I was actually really pleased with how they work. They seem like they last as long as any of the name brands, and definitely more superior to any other bulk batteries. I thought the price was very reasonable."
"I was hoping these batteries would last more than 4 hours, and since they didn't I don't think the price should be as listed"
This is not my first time to buy these batteries. I was pleasantly surprised to find these as good or better in longevity of battery life to Duracell. I would recommend these to anyone and I will seek these out over other brands when available.
I was surprised how good these batteries are. Very fresh. I bought other sizes also. Very happy with all of them.
I would have gotten the same quality had I got batteries from the dollar store. I was very disappointed.
The batteries are affordable and they last as long as any of the expensive ones. So why pay more !
I will never purchase this item again. It is in my opinion overpriced junk.
DID NOT LAST LONG
I will update my review when I see how long they really last but I gave it 5 stars for price and fast delivery.
These batteries do not last nearly as long as the bunny or copper brands. I will use them up and never waste my time or money on these again. I have been using them in an LED flashlight.
i won't buy batteries from home depot etc. anymore because these are equal quality to the well known brands and they are much cheaper and don't require sawing through plastic to open.
"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable."
These batteries hold a charge well. I have used the generation of batteries before these (the green ones) for many years in my computer mouse and keyboard and my camera flash. I would image these would be as good or better.
"I primarily use these for my noise cancelling headphones and wireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product. I do not get the longevity I received when buying other brands, but for the price and quantity it seems to all equal out. I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them in emergencies."
Works as intended. I would recommend!
Wish I had opened the package all the way as soon as I received it because several of the batteries had leaked and caused corrosion on several more. Learned one this time.
"They're not a bad value (because they're cheap), but they drain much faster than you would like. I hate throwing dead batteries away anyway (no recycling options here) and 4 of these drained in a day, running a tiny string of LED Christmas lights."
Batteries are decent. I wouldn't consider them better than Duracell or Energizer but the price is right.
Work well.
"I needed batteries, this was an incredible deal. Normally I would buy only Duracell, but these will do the job, and they aren't Energizer or Rayovac. As long as they last for more than a few months, I'll be happy."
"Nice batteries, without the famous name brands or high price..."
"I am very impressed with Amazon batteries. I use them in flashlights, and my latest test - the toilet bowl night light (search for it on Amazon and you'll see what I'm talking about). This thing eats up batteries very quickly! But the Amazon batteries last well over 1 month, when Duracell, Energizer and other top brands hardly last 1 month. I'll definitely order Amazon batteries for all sizes and keep a good supply in the house."
"I'm appreciative of those reviewers who have actually tested the voltage of these batteries, which definitely impacted me in buying them. I primarily bought these because they are cheap. I've got a handful of wireless keyboards/mice that use AA batteries and go through them pretty quickly. The batteries came easily packaged (in 4's within a box) and they work as described. I don't store batteries for long periods of time so I don't think I'll ever (possibly) encountering leaking issues."
Fast delivery. Good value!
"Amazon alkaline batteries are terrific! I've bought and used the AA AAA ones. I must say that they are just as good if not better than Energizer and Duracell, which I used to only use those. Not anymore!"
I miss the bunny with the drum.
I'm 100 satisfied with this pack of AA Amazon Basics batteries. I definitely would buy more in the future. I like the way the batteries are stacked in a simple organized box. Nice.
Works like a charm-m-m
"I'm confident that the batteries are good, but the packaging is less than convenient. Price can't be beat.1. The sticker on the battery cardboard package was quite hard to pull off. 2. The tab that opens the package was so tight that I had to pry it with a table knife. 3. After all that struggle I still had to cut away tight plastic on two packs of batteries! I'm used to my batteries in a plastic case/dispenser. This was an ordeal!"
Great so far...no bad apples in my batch.
What can a person say about alkaline batteries They work or they don't. I'm happy with the performance. It would take some really carefully planned load testing to compare the performance with other brands. They seems just as good.
These batteries work just as they should and only cost a fraction of the price of regular ones. I'm happy with them.
Quality product. Corresponding description. I'm happy. Thank seller.
These last just as long as the name brand. Will be buying these from now on. Price is a lot better too.
"I'm impressed worth the life of these batteries, still going strong after printing 3 cartridges worth of labels on my dymo labeler."
They don't last quite as long as regular batteries but long enough to still save money. I'm pleased with these batteries.
"I don't notice any difference between these batteries and premium brand name ones They seem to last just as long, and at a great price."
I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
I can't believe how low price these batteries are compared to in-store batteries. I've been using Amazon's batteries for a couple years and they work just as well and long as duracell and like brands.
"I've had good luck with Amazon basics peripheral devices for computers, but the 24 pack of AAA batteries I got had virtually no power out of the package. Perhaps it's a quality control issue, but I got burned on the ones I bought, and won't take another chance with them."
I love it when Amazon brings out commonly used products under their own name that perform well and are priced right. These AAA batteries are just another example of Amazon's buying power and smart branding. Because why would any company put their name (and reputation) on a product if they weren't convinced that it would be a true value to consumers The last thing that they want consumers to do is identify Amazon with anything but quality.So buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly. And if for some reason you get a bad batch--which can happen to anyone--simply return them under their return policy and get a replacement box.
I've used these exclusively for my two Xbox One controllers and have not tried any other batteries in them. They lasted for about 48 hours of play time before running out. That seemed quick to me but I don't have anything to compare it to. These were the right price. I will order again when I remember to order batteries before I need them.
"AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack)If anyone tells you that all batteries are the same, don't believe them. I worked in a battery manufacturing plant for 13 years. I can tell you that while they are made from the same ingredients and in the same way the power output is not the same. Because I know some about batteries then I can tell you that I like the quality of these batteries. I can't tell you how they are tested or at what point a battery is rejected but I can tell you that there are only certain types of batteries that I will buy because I don't believe in throwing away money and I Amazon batteries are right up there with my other 2 brands. I plan to continue to keep a supply of Amazon Batteries on hand at all times. You should too. You just can't beat the quality and the ease to purchase."
"If you are like me with a remote control for this and another one for that, not to mention battery powered clocks, etc. you can go thru a lot of AA batteries. These I can say have held up well with no problems of corrosion, rust or diminished longevity and buying in bulk makes for a better buy."
"These are OK. Used to Rayovacs to save but, these cost the same and seem to last about 3/4 as much as the other brand. Mostly used for Xbox controllers and Mac mice/keyboard."
thank you amazon for being clued into our needs and offering generic prices of things like batteries.
"Yup, they're batteries alright. But here's the cool thing: they're made by AMAZON! Amazon manufactures excellent quality products (think Costco/Kirkland), and their products cost so much less than comparable products from other manufacturers. I could see Amazon get into manufacturing everything, even cars and trucks, and taking over the world, and I'd be remarkably okay with that."
Good quality and price for families who have little kids (and lots of toys that constantly need new batteries!)
Fantastic deal for a ton of batteries.I've noticed these last an impressive amount of time - I still cannot believe how much of a ripoff store batteries are!
What is there to say about batteries They provide good power and are just as good as any other brand I have purchased.
"Pretty much works well, I'm just using these batteries for regular stuff things. So far no damage and it was deliver in less than 2 week so that was good."
"AA batteries are expensive, help is at Amazon."
if you use batteries like I do I would recommend these. Much cheaper than buying locally and just as good if not better
"Each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouse.Update: the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast. Nevertheless, it would be good if these Amazon batteries stated their capacity."
In clocks and light load these batteries work good. In something that draws more power like a hand-held labeler they do not live long
In my greatest time of need these batteries saved the moment I have been waiting for. It was a Monday but not just any Monday. I was getting ready to watch my favorite show. But when i went to turn on my tv my remote died. All I needed was four AAA batteries I thought all was lost then. Then I heard a knock on my door alas it was the mailman and he had these magnificent batteries. I could watch my show! Five stars five stars by god these batteries deserve it!
"Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries."
"Relatively inexpensive (I guess the multiplack of Kirkland batteries sold by Costco would be cheaper, but I didn't want to buy a ton of these, I needed them quickly and they were delivered right to my Mom's house in two days....well worth it), and they seem to work well...only time will tell if they hold up in the Fulcrum 30010-301 LED Battery-Operated Stick-On Tap Light, Silver, 3 Pack I purchased along with them"
"20 batteries for 8 bucks is cheap. You won't find that even at Costco. Hopefully, they will last."
Not much to say about batteries. They are inexpensive and work.
Have no problem using these batteries. Seem to last a long time.
"Excellent bought a case of these - something like 156 batteries - and threw them into LED flashlights. Work fantastically, packaged well, and inexpensive. But that's Amazon Basics products."
Work fine but I have had a couple start leaking in less than a month. Worried this may happen while in electronics.
"Interesting batteries. Felt tip marked the date. We'll see if they hold up against the competition.Batteries arrived in just a couple of days.Spam arrived, too. Lots of it. Did not click on the links, but forwarded the spam to stop-spoofingamazon.com. It finally stopped."
received quickly with n o damages. This battery seems to be the same as all the other ones.
You can't beat a great price on a ton of batteries. They are holding up like the name brands so far. I love Amazon basics. I just love everything Amazon really!
"It felt like opening a box of bullets.Decent power, great for using in my photography equipment. Plus, I don't feel bad about tossing them after a day's use."
Lot of cells. It got great reviews so the price was right!
The batteries work well for the price. It is a good valve
I can never have too many batteries - so many little things from remotes to flashlights. It is great to know I don't have to rake through drawers looking for batteries.
It stopped working. Never buy this. It's not certified by Apple. Not sure why Amazon is selling such products on prime
It was a very quick delivery and an excellent product. All batteries measure a bit over 1.5 volts and have perfect packaging.
"Price is right, but doesn't seem to hold as long of a charge as some of the other name brand batteries."
There... There batteries. It would be pretty hard to screw this one up
IT'S A BATTERY
"I have yet to be disappointed by an Amazon Basics product, to me a battery is a battery it's the cost I look at. These were the lowest cost per battery on the site."
C'mon it's batteries they work they were a good price
"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly."
"Inexpensive, it's a good buy!"
"They don't last as Duracell or Energizer. For the price, it's a good buy."
battery life is comparable to other more well-known brands! It's a great deal and a great product!
"They work, they're cheap, they come in annoying shrink wrapping."
Fine good price. It's a battery what can I say.
Cheap batteries for my TI-83 graphing calculator. Way cheaper than other brands and does what it's suppose to do.
It's nice to be able to order the batteries you are going to need right from Amazon so they arrive with your products
It's what you would expect from a good battery. Really not a lot to say. Expiration date was good. Another dependable Amazon product!
Item as described.
I purchased this item to use in the microphones in our church. Product is just what I expected and it works great. Price was good also.
Its a battery nothing much to say. I usually buy at costco but the convenience of the free delivery was the decision breaker this time.
Lights worked well but the ahesive didnt stick on about 90 of the lights backing. The 10 that did. I tried to adjust the lights and they ripped.
"We get alot of batteries on Amazon, its a good price and I have never had them leak as others have"
These batteries work but don't really last that long. You maybe get 3-4 weeks out of them. Its better off buying rayovac or energizer batteries from home depot
No better way to get ready for lots of gaming like bulk batteries.
Good batteries for an excellent price.
These batteries are junk . i use 4 of them in my front door lock. i have gone through 12 batteries in less than a month .
"Batteries used in fire remote, lasted maybe a week and then died"
"batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.junk dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon"
Absolute junk! My devices run only 3 - 5 days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when I put them in my devices. Save your money buy Duracell batteries from Groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but Amazon will not once you buy Amazon batteries as has become the case with most of Amazon you are on your on without a paddle.Amazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones. I don't know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible.
it's a good deal for the price but I don't seem to get much longevity out of them. I'm not done with them and will actually match them up against other batteries and will update.
These batteries are just adequate not super strong as advertised.
"They seem to work as well as the others I was buying at Costco. Haven't done in depth testing like some others here, but they work reasonably well for us."
Just as expected. We used them for the lazer tag guns and they guns are still going strong after two weeks of constant use.
"Just as good as leading brands, but alot cheaper. Will be buying more in the future."
Work just as well as the brand names
Good batteries. Arrived just in time
What can I say - they work and last just as good as any other brand I have tried. I bought various sizes from Amazon and they all work great - just make sure you buy in advance to have them on hand for when you need them instead of running to the store forking over a lot more money for the same performance - I did buy the 9 volt box to replace all my fire alarms in the house - PERFECT!
"Absolute best value for standard batteries (especially when using subscribe and save). If you aren't seeking rechargeable, I haven't ever been able to distinguish any real difference in quality or longevity between these and other top brands of batteries (Duracell, Energizer, etc.).Between my kids toys and my Xbox controllers, we go through about all of these batteries in about 6 months, so subscribe and save is the way to go."
"let's face it batteries can be stupid expensive. I usually buy top name brand batteries but, after reading some reviews I decided to try amazons brand. I will say I think they are just as good as any top brand battery. I am very happy with the quality and life span of the amazons brand battery and will continue to buy them. Thanks."
Great batteries.
We go through a lot of batteries in my house. I have found that the Amazon Basics batteries last just as long as the Energizer I normally buy and the price is so much better.
I was very skeptical of buying a not very well known brand of battery. We have a lot of toys and go through a lot of batteries .As far as I can tell just as good and lasts just as long as more expensive name brands.
Seems to be just as good as the name brand batteries. Haven't had issues with any yet.
These batteries are great! I purchased these because I was interested in trying the Amazon brand batteries. In comparison to other batteries these batteries weigh about the same as other name brand batteries and they last just as long. Only difference is you save money by buying these! I'm sold on these amazon brand batteries and I will continue to purchase these in the future and I will recommend them to family and friends.
Work great. No complaints.
I might even say they're better than name brand based on the price and quantity you get. Use them in everything from kids toys to flashlights to gaming controllers.
"Bought these for our camping trip to use in lanterns. Lasted just as long, if not longer than name branded ones."
Just as good as the big name brands...excellent value.
I haven't seen any difference in how long these last versus paying more for Energizer and Duracel. They are a bargain and to me batteries are almost the same no matter what as long as they are good cells and stable. I'll keep buying these.
"For the price, these can't be beat. I don't have scientific measurements, but these seem to last just as long in my mouse, keyboard, remote, etc. as the more expensive brands do, for a lot cheaper. I like having a lot on hand so that I don't run out and have to pay more for them at the store, so I order these in bulk in different sizes and I'm always prepared. Overall, I've had really good luck with the Amazon brand."
Great buy!
"I started using Amazon Basics Batteries several months ago in my flameless candles, flashlights, computer mouse, remotes, basically anything that requires AA batteries. These batteries work every bit as well and last as long as any name-brand batteries I've tried, at a much more reasonable price point. I like the convenience of the large economy packs, delivered promptly to my door. Way to go, Amazon!"
"Just as good as the name brand ones I get at the store. LOVE buying batteries at Amazon, it's SO much cheaper!!"
Good Batteries.
These seem to be every bit as good as the name brands. Have used them in many applications.
Fine batteries for general use.
Who would have thought amazon batteries could compete with the other top brands. They definitely serve their purpose and I will buy again.
"Great batteries, very comparable to all the top name brands, but at a much better price!!"
These batteries work just like any other top brand battery out there. These batteries are not the low voltage batteries that you might've accidentally purchased because you were thinking you were getting such a good deal. Great batteries for a great price.
"Batteries worked well, just as well as the store bought ones but at a better price"
"I think my favorite thing is that they come in the convenient box. Keeps my junk drawer a lot neater without having batteries rolling around or stuck in baggies. Otherwise, they're just batteries. I haven't noticed any difference from the duracells and energizers I used to use."
"A nice size bulk pack of AAA batteries. Beats the prices of what walmart or target has. These are NOT rechargeable, seen some people asking if they were in the question box. Will do just fine for remotes, flash lights, kids toys etc."
"These come packaged into 4's, love that! I bought them specifically for the emergency lanterns I got and since they are packed separated into 4's I can put them with the lanterns perfectly. They work great and have had ZERO problems with these. Definitely recommend!"
"I haven't done any scientific research on how long these last compared to other batteries, I can only give you my layman's experience. I use the exact same amount of battery usage every day and have tried pretty much every brand of battery (I don't hear that well so I wear headphones for my television and I wear them the same number of hours per day).The AmazonBasics batteries don't last nearly as long as any other battery. My headphones start getting fuzzy about twelve hours earlier than they normally would with any other the batteries I've ever used. I went through this package a week earlier than I would a 24-pack of either Duracell or Energizer. In some usages this might not matter but for me, it just wasn't worth it to buy these."
Good deal. Good battery. No complaints.
Seem to last just as long as any other major brand.
"What can you say about batteries They work and are very reasonable. Amazon prime means no shipping cost. I haven't done any comparison between these and other brands.But then, I have a life to live."
"Performs well, inexpensive, A++"
Best Deal for the price of what you need
"Batteries holds up ,just like the big name brands ....use them in my radio ,remotes..they last a long time ...sure glad I bought them before I get the higher price ones"
Great for small gadgets and remotes. Don't expect to run anythinh more. Could handle a set of battery power hair clippers.
I bought these but will not reorder. They work but seem to go flat rather quickly.
do not seem to last as long as other batteries
Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.
"these are okay, not as good as Energizer, but cheaper"
The life of these batteries is shorter than name brand.
Compared to other AA Battery types these take the cake! I just LOVE these AmazonBasics Batteries.
Just received these today and they are dated 11/2026 so the performance brand truly has a ten year shelf life. I've had about the same performance from these amazons as with regular duracells recently. For the price I couldn't ask for anything more.
Great quality and super cheap! What else you can ask for
Just right. Quick shipping/adequate packing/as pictured described!! Thanks so much!!
These batteries light up my life! Well at least my TV and my kids turtle night light. My world would be so dark and lonely without them. The right price brought happiness to our world
Now my robot army will never run out of power again MUAHAHAHAHAHA!
Just what I wanted.
Love Amazon basics. Useful products at good prices.
So far. So good. Appears to perform as well as the national brands.
"Just like brand name, but cheap and convenient"
"Cheap AAA batteries. Really shouldnt expect much, just wish they would last as long as comparably priced batteries. I use them for the light i wear on my head at work. Typical AAAs last 6-8 hours constant use, these last about 3-4."
They seem to work well. We use them in all our electronics that call for it. Never had a problem and they seem to last as long as other brands.
These are great batteries for the price! I use them for my Xbox controllers. I game a lot and I use 2 batteries a week or so.
"Good product,fair price, handy quantity for household, great shopping experience. Thanks"
Grandkids and toys rather says it all. These are long-lasting and at a good price.
"Great batteries at a great price, what's not to like"
"Batteries work well, kids love having the battery stash for toys, can't beat the Amazon price on these."
Great bang for you buck on AA batteries. Will be buying again when and if we ever run out LOL!!!
These don't last like good batteries. But are a great price. If you have kids that leave toys on and run out batteries then these are good. I don't use them in the remote or anything I want to rely on for long term use.
"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."
"I purchased a box of these. First replacement for my outdoor weather info transmitter didn't work so well. Within a couple of days the receiver wasn't receiving a signal from the transmitter, so I changed out the batteries once again. Within 96hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitter and wouldn't display a temperature reading. This week I'll replace those again (3rd time in 6wks) and expect a low-battery warning just days after. Unsure if I should demand an exchange or full reimbursement. Maybe they do well in warm temps, but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a Duracell or Energizer."
Decent price for the grand kid's toys. Last a good time.
"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!"
"Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time"
These work great and last and much better price then store.
We were tired of buying expensive batteries and these work perfectly. They're not super light weight like some of the other brands so you can tell they're of equal quality to the name brands.
"We've been going through a lot of AAA sized batteries and have been able to verify that these Amazon Basics batteries last just as long as other name brand alkaline batteries from Duracell, Rayovac or energizer in low and steady drain devices. Due to the price advantage we will keep using these."
they are batteries at a low price how can you go wrong.We go threw a lot of batteries in my house and I am sick of running out of them . soi signed up for a reaccuring of these.they are cheaper then big box stores.
Love these batteries
"Everyone debates how long batteries last and these work perfectly fine. As a college student who spends a ton of time playing Xbox, my roomates and I went through batteries by the dozen and were always short. Instead of taking them out of any device we coud get our hands on (remotes, calculators, etc) we decided to just get these in bulk. They are much cheaper than getting anything in store and last long enough that we didnt notice a difference. A pair in an Xbox 360 controller lasted a good 4 months with almost daily use which is better than most batteries in my opinion."
"Last just as long or longer than the name brands! I game alot and have been using Duracell or energizer, whichever is on sale. Decided to try these and so far I feel like they have lasted longer than the name brands. Ill update if this changes"
"My go to batteries. Good battery life with these, and they cost so little"
I bought some over a year ago and I still have a couple of packets of 4. Gonna get some more soon
These work just as good as higher priced batteries. We go through tons of AA's in our home so I did the subscribe and save which saves us some money and gives me one less thing to remember to grab every month or two.
First time trying the Amazon batteries and glad I did. These batteries have out lasted the Duracell batteries we used before and are cheaper! Will definitely purchase again.
Last longer than any Alkaline I have purchased. Performance Alkaline Batteries.
Affordable batteries that last longer than Duracell!
Much better than big name brands!!!
"Literally. Bought these in May and they JUST ran out. These are great batteries (F the specs, I'll leave that to battery specialists. But these lasted way longer and better than a Plug and Play. Minus the cord when the battery died. Bought these again. Can't beat the price of effectiveness."
Lasted an average amount of time for batteries that I normally use in my Xbox controllers. Definitely worth the price tho.
"Lasted ten minutes in my flashlight. Changed out the batteries again, the next two lasted 12 minutes. Don't buy. Junk!"
"Two batteries came with my amazon basics mouse i bought. I was suprised that it took two years for them to die. Definitely buying again, highly recommend."
"No complaints, so far the batteries are lasting as they should for batteries of this size."
Like Duracell
"With several kids, we go through a lot of batteries for toys games. So many, in fact, that I have kept them on my monthly subscribe save. Previous to trying the Amazon Basic brand I had used Duracell Maxell. As both of the former increased their prices, I decided to try the Amazon brand. I actually expected a generic performance but was happily mistaken when they lasted as long as the name brands One of my children is special needs and has an electronic keyboard that uses 6 AA batteries. With Duracell, we got about 15 hours of use, Maxell was about 14.5 and with Amazon Basic I am getting just over 15. AmazonBasics are my new battery brand"
I was very surprised when the package arrived. These are AA batteries!
"An alkaline battery is an alkaline battery, no matter whose brand name is on it."
Awesome for the price. Lasts as long as the name brands
Pretty impressed at how much longer these last than regular name brand. I will never spend money on top notch batteries after using these. These last way longer.
Grabbed these fairly cheap and didn't expect much. I use these for my Xbox one controllers and have only gone through 2 sets so far. This pack looks like it will last some time until I pick up a rechargeable battery pack. Beats your dollar store batteries by a mile.
Fast shipping. Amazon basics last longer too. Been buying them for awhile
Way great battery! I love em. Cheap and last forever.
"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again."
Do not buy each have leaked within one recharge. Battery corrosion at base ruined my battery recharger as well. Warranty for 30 days. You can't use them all and recharge within 30 days
Two batteries of he the twenty were leaking in the Package on delivery. With a ten year warranty against leakage...that is not a good start
Half the box did not work and one set of 4 started leaking white battery acid within 5 minutes of putting it my sons toy. Asking Amazon for a full refund.
Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.
"I've kept a stock of these batteries for about a year (in a drawer in my living room) and used them in my air freshener with no problems. However, when I used them with my Pawbo toy (it's a remote cat toy), not only do they not last very long, but I just went to replace the batteries and saw that were leaking after only a day!"
"Maybe we have a bad batch because all the other Amazon Basics batteries we have are great.. So far numerous AA batteries are leaking in remotes, toys, and other electronics."
After 2nd recharge and use all but 3 are leaking corrosive fluid which has ruined my charger.
"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries."
"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."
"These batteries are the worst of any I've ever bought. They have corroded inside of toys, remotes, noise cancelling range headphones and an expensive gun scope that I own. I've tried AA and AAA, and even gave them multiple chances. The batteries in some electronic devices die within 24hrs. So needless to say, I have switched back to standard Duracell batteries. If you care about life and not having to mess with corrosion, do not buy these batteries!!!"
These night lights are worthless. They do not work as described on Amazon.
"To me, a battery is a battery is a battery. These were cheaper and I thought they worked just fine."
"These batteries don't seem inferior to the more expensive Duracells and Energizer that we have been using. We have been using these primarily to go in our XBox One controllers, and they last a few weeks to a month with pretty consistent use, about the same as other AAs we have used. The price can't be beat, even cheaper than Costco at the time of purchase and with free shipping in hassle free packaging."
I just wanted to comment that I feel the individual 4-pack packaging is unnecessary. I personally don't have anything that takes four batteries. Several twos and a lot of threes. I'd prefer a box full of loose batteries rather than having to search around for a knife to cut free what I need.
"Never had alkalines that die as fast. This has been consistent through the package, not just a couple of batteries. Same results when used in TV remotes, optical mouse, smoke detectors and small flashlights."
Life span long...performance upto satisfaction. Reliable. No failure. Only performance.
"These batteries works great. Bought the 48 pack for basic essentials around the house, such as clocks, remotes, wireless mouse keyboards, etc."
"Well, you know...these are batteries. They work....like batteries. Great price and I see no difference in their performance or duration compared to bigger brand batteries."
"No issues so far. Like the way they are packaged, very economical and space saving."
We always use these batteries and they work as well an Duracell for a lot less. We will continue to buy.
"Works well, good price."
liked it
The batteries linked and ruined my Game Camera. I think you need to replace my game Camera
Works both lights working with power
"I purchased a box of 48 AA batteries and the first 2 that I tried to use were dead the other 2 in the blister 4 pack worked fine, but a 50 failure rate is unacceptable. I will update how the rest of the box works as I try to use them. I will purchase a name brand next time."
always happy with the amazon basics batteries as they live up to expectations and the price is right
These batteries seem to work as well as other brands at a much better price point.
"Might be okay. But, they seem cheap. They have warm light (orangeish in color). They have the feeling that they might only last a year or too, and not multiple Christmas seasons. We are doing a timer test and have one that does not want to follow the standard timer. Also, the window suction cup things are to small for these candles. They will ultimately work, but are going to be stretched to do so. Picture is of the loan gunmen candle (screw the built of n timer!!!)."
"Good knob. Looks good. Logo faded/wore off in a few months though... logo is kinda why I bought this, so.........."
Purchased at a decent price and haven't noticed any difference from any other batteries I have used. Long as you can get them at a decent price I'd definitely recommend.
"Incredible deal for this prices, the batteries are long duration nice!"
"2nd time purchasing these battteries. They last a long time in everything i have put them into, baby toys,remotes,game controllers etc. Just as good as the name brand or better, Zer0 Complaints!"
"Good quality, long lasting."
Great batteries for the price
"I bought these to use in wireless microphones at my church. The receivers have battery strength meters built in, so I know when it's time to replace the batteries. These batteries last longer than the brand name I had previously been using."
I love getting these batteries delivered through subscribe and save. I'm never out of batteries anymore. It was a constant battle with my family to hunt down batteries and to remember to buy them at the store. They also seem to be long lasting.
Long Lasting and nice.
"Long lasting, reusable packaging."
"Reviewers aren't wrong.The Amazon Basics Performance batteries are long lasting. My grand kids go through a lot of batteries with the toys I keep for them. Buying them locally costs a fortune! These larger packages of the Amazon Basics make the price per battery so delightful. And they last with good power for a long time!Thank goodness for Amazon, and for their brand!"
These are as good as any batteries you buy in the stores.
These batteries are really long lasting. I use them for my Xbox one and I haven't had to change one pair yet. It does the job well
These batteries lasted a surprisingly long time. With all the remotes for the gaming consoles we use we've just gotten to the last 4 and it's been over 2 months. Super impressed!
These batteries seem to last as long as the name brands you would purchase at the store. I have saved a lot of money by buying these in bulk instead of running to the store every time I need batteries. I am happy with these and will probably order more when I run out.
These truly are long lasting I'd had them in my game remote and they last longer than the name brand definitely would repurchase
They last like regular high end batteries.
"If you're looking for cheap but durable batteries look no further. I personally like amazon products. I know I can count on them as much as a named brand, but for a 1/4 of the price. I got these on Prime day for a great price and the last a OK amount of time. I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy. If you're looking to save money from the expensive name brands, go with a Amazon brand product its becoming more common and competitive as a name brand product."
Batteries work just as well as Duracell or whatever other name brand you can find at the stores. Long lasting and great quality. Will buy agian.
Better than any other battery we've tried. Long lasting and inexpensive.
Long lasting and nice. Does not heat up or lose charge while on high heat or very harsh cold temperature. It is also very cheap!
"I needed some AAA's and decided to go with these since I no longer have an acive COstco membership. So far these batteries have held up very well in my remotes, several headlamps, and tactical flashlights that I regularly use. Great purchase"
"Great long lasting batteries. I ordered these to use in an LED book light. I have also installed them in a small flashlight. The Amazon batteries last at least twice as long as a the value brand I had been using in my book light. Good value, good performance."
Great batteries! Long-lasting. Great value.
I find these batteries last longer than Duracell. I use it on small light that stays on for 4 hours 5 nights a week. Great product from Amazon.
Works better than any name brand I have ever used.
"Outstanding value. Long lasting. I have now switched all of my battery purchases over to Amazon Basics (AA, D, 9V, AAA) I haven't experienced a bad battery in the whole lot."
Much cheaper and long lasting than most bargain brands. We use them in Xbox/Wii controllers mostly.
"So far, so good! Works and last as well as the most expensive named brand."
"So far, so good! Very happy with how long these batteries last."
"Long lasting, priced right and use these in various applications such as LED flashlights, mouse, keyboards, etc.Of course I shall buy again to restock."
Just like any other batters. And at a better price then most of the name brands.
Awesome! These last just as long as the big brands. A great value and great battery.
Love the amazon batteries. Great price and they last long!
Perfect quality. These last a long time!
They last forever!
Love!! Exactly what I paid for. It came in a nice cardboard package and I use it as a storage for the unused batteries. I've had these for months and the first pair are still going strong. I'm very happy with my purchase.
Love the long life at a great price . I use these daily and compared to the big brands works just as well
Seem to have a great life to them. I'm impressed.
These batteries last a long time and does not leak even after it runs out of juice. I use these to power my remotes and nightlights and have not experienced any problem whatsoever with it.
"We used these batteries in digital microphone packs for our production of Fiddler on the Roof (a long musical, btw). I wasn't sure if they would last through the performance, since digital microphones use up more power as they are always searching for a signal. The AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline batteries did not disappoint. I used Energizer MAXX (30 more power) in a couple of the microphone packs, and they died out before the show was over. The AmazonBasics had juice to spare! I will purchase these from now on. More power for almost half the cost!"
Longest lasting batteries I've ever used. I bought them for my Xbox One controllers which I used for hours at a time every day and I replace batteries maybe once every couple weeks.
Seem good quality. Will update after seeing how they last.
Same for these AA batteries as for the AAA batteries.
Great batteries! I have nothing negative I can say about this product. They work just as well as any name brand product you would buy off the shelf at any store except these are probably one quarter of the price.
Put these in our candles on November 25. They are in for 8 hours every night. As of Jamuary 17 almost all of them are still going!!!!!!!!
Lot of batteries for the price and the seem to work just as well as any name brands I have tried in the past.
"Lot of good batteries at a good price. Can you find CHEAPER batteries Yes but they're of worse quality. Can you find BETTER batteries Yes but it'll cost you. Both of those other options have their own usage scenarios, but these are a great middle ground that works in most average cases."
"Nice having all these batteries at a good price. Haven't tried yet but, how bad can it be."
So far so good as far as batteries go. I order them under subscribe and save. Makes the price even better and we always have plenty for our toddler.
"They are batteries, what else can you say"
Batteries...what can one say about them that wouldn't be too obvious LoL
"lots of batteries, good price, seem to last as long as brand name"
What a great deal for the price. I will never purchase batteries in the store again!!
Simple and clean. Love AmazonBasics
I love these batteries! I've got two 4 year olds that help me run through batteries as well as a flashlight I use constantly for work. I've noticed no difference in how long these last compared to higher end lines like Duracell. The price and quality can't be beat
I love the Amazon basics batteries and the aaa are no different. They last s long time and the price is unbeatable!
I am constantly pleased with the Amazon Basics branded products. Both the quality of the product packaging keep me purchasing them over other brands.I will continue to buy Amazon Basics!
They work but they don't last they drain really quickly only had them about 2 weeks and they are almost all dead. Very frustrating will not be buying these again save your money and buy Duracell.
"Love Amazon, but these batteries lasted 3 weeks in my Roku controller, Family Dollar store brand lasted longer. I do have A LOT of them though. Well played planned obsolescence :l"
As advertised!
Can't beat the price what so ever. Love AmazonBasics!!!!
"Need a backup stock of AAA that you are willing to dispose of instead of keep track of and charge Amazon Basics does the job well and I have no complaints.I use these for my remote controls, gaming controllers (xb1, xb360, wiimotes), my receipting calculator, Logitech mice, etc! Pretty much whatever needs AAA batteries, this is my solution. :DCompared to the prices of of Energizer or Durcaell 12-packs, this beats those big time while meeting standards."
"These batteries are awesome... we run 6-7 trail cameras on our ranch all year around to manage our ranch, and we are in constant need of changing batteries (and I mean constant). This package of batteries gives us the ability to order large quantities that we can store in one place, while it's also a CRAZY cheap price compared to all other battery brands. And they are great durable and long lasting batteries!! I'm forever hooked."
The batteries are great quality.What I liked the best about it is the was its packaged! It comes in a card box that can be open/closed and in it the batteries are packaged with a wrapper in a group of 4. Absolutely brilliant!No more loose batteries that you have to guess if they are old or new!!!Goodbye durable... Hello amazon basics!
I WILL BUY IT AGAIN
love it
Very good
Very good buy love having these available. My kids toys mostly run on these
"Love it , no better deals on the net"
Batteries come in small boxes of their own which makes it easier to organize and store. Love it !!
Always a pleasure to have a near unlimited supply of batteries! Thanks Amazon!
I AM GOING TO BUY MORE. YOU CAN BEAT THAT PRICE AND THE AMOUNT YOU ARE GETTING. LOVE IT.
Love the Amazon batteries. I think that last just as long as any other high brand battery but at a fraction of the price. I'll continue to buy and use these along with their other sizes.
"Love the batteries. Not sure what else I can say about them, they work -- Ill have to post an addition to let you know how long they worked."
Great batteries and great the price is great to I will almost definitely buy these again.
Love the price and quality. The quality is really good too. Ordered these for my office and figured I'd stock up at home for the price. They come packaged really well. I can always use extra batteries!
Love the price of these batteries. They don't last as long as bigger brands like Duracell or energizer but you get a lot of batteries for not a lot of money so I love it.
Great packaging!
Works exactly as expected. Love the value.
I have been buying AmazonBasic batteries for a few years now and love them. Great price and I have found the batteries last just as long as the name brand ones and cost less.
Love these batteries.
Very powerful nice price.
love them work great but while charging they leaked all over the charger and had to just throw 8 of them away
"In comparison to the name brand batteries, these are just as reliable. I cannot notice a difference between these batteries and the name brand batteries. Love them!"
Does the job. Love these batteries!
"Love these batteries, they are just as good as the coppertop or the bunny brand, and cost less too, what's not to love"
Love these batteries. Was delivered on the day they promised. These batteries are just as good as Duracell Quantum or better. You would be a fool not to buy these if you go through as many as I do. Great deal.
"Love these batteries - they are easy to purchase, delivery is speedy and they come right to your door :)"
Love these batteries they seem to have a good battery life and for the price you can't get much better!
Love these BUT 2 of the 4 packages were NIT warm lights. They are really super bright cold white. Can't use them.
Awesome lights! Compact and easy to pack but give off a huge light! Great customer policies too!
"I love these batteries! They're cheaper than brand name, they last just as long, and the packaging really is easier to opening. I'm never buying batteries from the store again."
"Love this candle. When lights are turned out, it truly looks like a real candle. I bought 2 more and will probably get a few more for Christmas gifts."
I put these in a set of lights I have over my door and my Wii remote the day they arrived back in April and they are still going strong at the end of August! Love these!
"Love this , got tired of buying the 2 name brands. My son goes through AA batteries like there is no tomorrow due to him using these for his xbox controller ( and yes, he has a rechargeable one also but.....it's always dead). For the money, I'll stick w/ the amazon brand batteries from now on"
"I love these batteries. I need to buy more. They hold their charge really well. I've replaced almost all my batteries with these batteries,"
"Great price, great battery life, great look, just great, love it :D"
I purchased these on 3/24/16 and last week I used a pair on a wireless keyboard. Within 1 hour my keyboard was blinking the low battery sign. I replaced the batteries with two new ones and the light blinked again within half an hour.My keyboard isn't the problem because I ended up using Eneloop AAA batteries and it worked fine the rest of the day.
This was the 2nd time that I have ordered Amazon batteries only to find they all had about a half charge.
Amazon batteries are awesome! Low cost and last long!
"While these batteries work, they don't last as long as expected. They lasted about 1/2 the time as a standard store bought battery (Energizer/Duracell/Rayovac). I will not buy these again. In contrast, the Amazon Basics AA Rechargeable is Awesome."
"Used it for a mouse - works OK. I have a battery powered egg beater and when I put these batteries, the beater did not perform at full speed. I had some Duracell batteries which I used and it was back to life!!So, I guess these are low powered, Very disappointed"
"Great deal, work perfect."
"As good as any brand, but lower price."
These batteries perform just as well as the big name brands and for a fraction of the cost.
Do not last as long as Copper Top!
Picture for proof. I had these in an Amazon basics wireless mouse and one of them exploded. It was only in there about 3 months before I noticed the batteries were dead. Upon inspection it was clear one of the batteries had a structural failure and exploded the end apart leaking fluid inside mouse.This mouse has NEVER been out of my air conditioned office.I have never had a battery explode inside a mouse before. These are obviously low quality. Do not put them into anything you'd be upset to ruin with leaky battery fluid.
more than half of these batteries didn't even last but three months while in storage. what a disappointment!
"lowest price per unit by far, great deal, that is what i was looking for. batteries work fine and last as long as any other"
I love Amazon and Amazon products but....MAJOR disappointment. While not much less cost that Duracell or Energizer the Amazon brand batteries were a ripoff! Only lasted a third of the time in the devices I have used the competitor's batteries in before.....bummer :(
"Make Amazon batteries YOUR BATTERIES ! If you haven't discovered this by now, that these alkaline batteries are fresher, longer lasting and more economical than wasting your money on dollar stores batteries or over-priced Duracell that may have been made years ago before you purchased them, get with it. Support a successful service that most of us can't do without !"
Great pack of batteries. What can I say It's a great big box of AA batteries. Power is good!
"Works......not sure if better than other brands, have only used two so far for clocks.....go fish. Five star for price."
"Needed badly for so many appliances, work well and will hopefully last long!"
Many batteries do not have full capacity. I read each with a meter before using. Often find one at .8 volt or below. I won't buy again.
"I'm not sure if it's coincidence it not but two electronics we've put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I'll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch"
"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries."
Jury still out. Only recently used a couple.
I'm not sure these are lasting as long as more well-known brands. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure.
Good Deal!
"Not worth buying, these are just a slight grade above cheap Chinese batteries. Your going to replace them x2 or x3 times as often as top of the line batteries. So take the price of top of the line batteries and divide it by 2 and then compare the price with these. Not bad for the price but not worth the hassle."
"Can't beat the price for all these batteries. Why would people go to local store and pay exorbitant prices for batteries which you can get at a cheaper price. Maybe they last as long say for instance like Duracell or Eveready but for the price of an off brand, it is still well worth it."
Meet expectations.
"So far so good, will keep buying Amazon Basics batteries."
I'm sure they will meet my needs. Thanks.
Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.
"Great price but they don't hold their charge for long. I find myself swapping out the remote batteries twice a year. At this price, it's not so bad but it's much more frequently that I'm used to."
"These batteries work for normal things. But when i tried to use them for a dog collar that is supposed to help with barking, they were too weak and had to be changed after three uses. Annoying."
"These die out super quickly. In saying that, I'm not sure if the items they were in sucked the life out of the faster but they still died. Used nearly a whole pack for little LED closet lights in a couple of months - only on for a few minutes at s time."
These just don't last as long as the name brand product. Found that we replace these twice as often as a Duracell equivalent. Won't be buying them again.
They don't last super long
"They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Xbox One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair."
They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Lowes are way better.
They work but clearly don't last as long as name brand batteries. If you want low cost batteries then buy these.
Great Product
Met our need
Great bang for the buck. Amazon batteries....Who knew
"A competing brand used to run my wireless trackball for two months, these last less than a week!"
"I purchased these batteries hoping they could hold their own amongst my other portable powered devices. Low and behold, I put these in a talking teddy bear and it proceeded to beat up the Energizer powered bunny in my house. I was very thankful for that because the darn rabbit's constant drum beating was driving me insane. After the bunny crawled away from the brawl bruised and defeated, the bear gave me a thumbs up and has protected me ever since. Thank you for these batteries Amazon, they have changed my life."
Only 32 batteries in the package when advertised as 36.
Some were nearly dead out of the box
Best looking batteries in the biz
"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."

They work well I really did no comparison to other brands but the price was a great deal less .
"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shopper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remotes that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. So, finding some that were affordable was necessary to keep everyone happy."
Great value
"What can I say, when I have nothing to say, but I have to in order to leave feedback"
"I can never have enough batteries. We use them so quickly, I love to have extra boxes. These were a good price and they seem to work well."
"great price, great product, works well in all my devices and flashlights, see no difference in performance compared to the national brands"
Great deal on these! Seem to have more initial power than most alkalines. Great for my electric razor! Get them if you have kids with lots of toys that eat batteries!
Works as well with the same time supply in very expensive name brands.
Will never buy anything other than amazon brand!!!
"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Waste of time for what you get."
More than 1/2 have been dead out of the box. Most other Amazon Basic products I have gotten have been great. Batteries have been beyond sub par so far.
"Have used these for a few weeks and find they do not last quite as long as Duracell, but they are 1/3 the price. The price difference makes them a much, much better option. I will always reorder these in the future instead of the competition."
Worked well. I got these for some remote control mice I had purchased. Much fun was had scaring the office staff.
so far they are good. just got them in today. so can't say how long thy will last. hopefully awhile.
Great batteries!
"i use to buy my batteries from Cvs, rite aid these are great quality and long lasting."
Wow had these in my Xbox remote for 5 days non stop use and still a full charge !!!!!!
"I was previously buying batteries at dollar tree, 4 at time. This will not only save me time, but money and they're great quality for the price! As soon as I opened, I put them to use for my Xbox one wireless controller to try them out and they have lasted much longer than the batteries I was using before."
Works great. You have to rinse it with hot water to remove all lint/ hair and let it dry. It's sticky again just like new ready to use again.
"you have kids, teenagers that like toys, remote control cars or anything that require batteries then this is item is for you.. easy to use.. dont think about it just buy it.. : )"
prefect and inexpensive
"Thanks, Amazon! I love the convenience of ordering batteries online and at a great rate. We put them into a battery organizer we have which is in our junk drawer (which is not junky thanks to the organizer). The batteries work well as far as we can tell, and it's great to get them at a low cost with free shipping."
Cant beat these batteries.
"Yes it met all expectations for speed, durability. My grandson Loved it"
"It seems every toy my 2 year old currently owns has batteries in it for the price, I can't find a better deal on a battery than these.I don't know about all that fancy ratings that other reviewers write about, but I know when I put these in a toy for my son, he starts smiling again. That's all I need from a product."
"My life changed when I bought these. I didn't know what to expect, but the best way I can describe them is bottled lightning. It's amazing -- these things deliver electricity to my headphones, remotes, flashlights, wireless mouse, and more. These will work in just about anything that fits these small cylinders. It's like magic.One problem I found is that you need to put them in the right way. Might take a few times to get it right, but once you do, you'll be happy. Also, does not fit in AAA sockets. If Amazon could fix that, it would be EPIC!"
"I'm the kind of person that always stocks batteries. With a small child that has lots of toys (not to mention my own toys) you never know what size batteries you'll need. C is a size only a few of my devices use. One is a lantern and the other is an electronic pest deterrent that I have to keep the deer away from my growing trees. I have always purchased the big two name brands in batteries and I always make sure to buy Alkaline batteries. My love for Amazon and their AmazonBasics products brought me to these and with the Amazon pricing and quality, I figured I couldn't go wrong.These batteries come in easy to open packaging and have the same shelf life as competing brands. I bet that one of those two brands makes these batteries for Amazon and simply private labels their name on them, as the quality is obviously there. I see no difference in longevity, shelf life, size or quality. If you're looking to save a few bucks but still have a top performing battery, look no further than AmazonBascis alkaline batteries. I hope you found my review helpful!My reviews are my opinions of the product received and just my opinion. Everyone is different and could have a different opinion of a product. I do not receive any monetary payment for my reviews, and I always keep them honest. So no need to worry whether or not my review is genuine, because it is. Also if you found this review helpful marking it as so would be greatly appreciated thanks!"
"So far, so good. My new source for batteries. I love me some Amazon"
"Last longer than Energizer. They're no Duracell, but hey, you can't beat them all, all the time! Am I right I'll pretty much be investing in these batteries for the rest of my life."
These are now my go-to batteries....sorry copper top. I used them for lights at my daughter's wedding and they are still going strong!
"my parents need it. Honestly, I am looking to buy a few, cheap. Good bargain for the money. Very comfortable and very fine . They are not for me, they do not ride, they are not too tight Very fast, receive it next day."
Best way to have electronics work is having them be charged or have batteries! Buying this pack will fix the needing batteries part!
My son goes through batteries like crazy so I bought him this pack for his birthday no complaints and they last a lot longer than dollar store batteries.
"These batteries seem to have enough power. My sons remote monster truck barely moves with new batteries installed from her byut work perfectly fine with new Duracells. However, for basic other stuff they do the job."
"These batteries are every bit as good as the name brands, at a very nice price. Will order again for sure."
These batteries are as good as any national brand.
I have been using Amazon Basics Batteries for some time now. They are just as good as the name brands that cost a good bit more. We don't use as many disposable batteries as we used to but even after being stored for some time the quality does not seem to degrade. There is no reason to waste money purchasing the brand names when the Amazon Basics are of the same quality.
stock up on these at a great price.
I need batteries that register 1.5V out of the box my camera flash remotes depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.3V fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.3V batteries
These we got for the flashlight for a birthday party. They work.
I have no qualms about the quality of these batteries.I only wish that every 4 batteries were not individually wrapped.
Shortest battery life ever... definitely don't try to save a few bucks here ...
"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far."
Terrible! Didn't last 2 weeks!
ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BATTERIES IVE EVER USED AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THEM
Great batteries for the price! I NEVER buy batteries from the store now!
stock up
Good to have A batteries at such a good price
"We tend to forget to buy batteries until hurricane season rolls around, so what a lifesaver this package is. We've purchased several different sizes, all good. They appear to last as long as other brands. Will definitely order more."
This box of batteries was a great value. Better than buying from the other box stores. I like how they came in an easy to open cardboard box. Each set of 4 inside the box is wrapped in a thin layer of plastic so the batteries don't roll around and make a mess. I used these to replenish all my kids' talking/lightup toys...as those toys don't generally work well with rechargables. I'm going to buy more of these as needed!
So far so good
"New source for batteries. I'll keep a box or two of these around the house from now on.Less packaging would be nice. A sealed box, then shrinkwrap."
The package just arrived and all seems well. I have no information on the life of these batteries. If they do well I would be glad to give them 5 stars.
good batteries
Great batteries
Great batteries for a great price
Great price
great price - perfect for what I needed it for
I did not know that amazon sold batteries.nice stuff
I usually buy Duracell but decided to try these Amazon batteries. They're good. Not sure I'd remember to buy them again but they worked well for me.
it's great
Long lasting
Needed some decent batteries. Gets the job done.
Nice
"So far so good, works well with my products and shipping was super fast. Came in pretty much next day and I chose regular shipping. Super glad I bought these."
These are good batteries
These batteries are nice for the money and they last as long as the big name brands. Thanks Amazon
Works great
I like that they come in a very nice compact package though I could do without the plastic wrap of four each. So far they work just as well as the ones I used to buy from Costco but I don't have to wait for Costco's sale and deal with Costco's packaging.
"Nice amount of batteries to have on hand, have not used any yet so waiting to see how these will perform!"
"My wee computer mouse sure eats batteries, thankfully these were available. I like having extras around for my wee LED flashlights also."
Good price and arrived quick!
"These don't last quite as long as Duracell, but for the price it's hard to complain. Nice basic batteries. No issues except for slightly shorter lifespan."
Nice Batteries
These works great for everyday use
"This is the first time I buy amazon batteries. Was a little skeptical at first, but this batteries work as good as the major brands. Very happy with the purchase."
They power things. They work. Also a good price!
Good batteries! Do their job.
"I like the battery pack, I haven't had time to try them yet."
"Nice box, good price. Only improvement would be to eliminate the 4pack wrapping. The clear plastic wrap seems like an unnecessary step when changing our kids toy batteries"
Lasting a long time in my remotes. Nice easy to open packaging.
would buy again.
Packaged nicely.
"Speedy delivery, convenient packaging - and the batteries seemed to last longer than usual in my application (wireless mikes) - still had 3 bars at the end of a 3-hour run, where most commonly I'd be down to 1 or 2 bars. Would buy again."
Fantastic prices these Amazon batteries are. Haven't used very long so I can't say how they perform yet.
Just received them and trying them out. So far so good.
They fit where they're supposed to and have good durability.
Nice product. As described.
Nice set of batteries at a good price point. Don't last as long as the name brand ones but for the price it's worth it to buy these. I only have amazon batteries in my house
Nice to have a easy to access package that doesn't allow the batteries to just keep falling out once opened like most battery packages.
I like that I can order these on-line with Prime shipping directly to my house in a few days. I use a lot of batteries during the holidays starting with Halloween through Easter. Not a bad price and they seem to last awhile.
Only confusion was the difference between our current dip switch and this one. If it does not work flip the switches in the opposite directions.
"Work great and is a rather convenient way to purchase batteries. Though, they package 4 per cellophane wrapping and it is kind of annoying to get off, but that's just me being nit-picky"
"nice , just found my new batteries , great price , expires 2026"
Great product!!!!
Great deal great product!
Standard product good battery life!
They do the job. Nicely packaged too!
"Some of the best batteries I've ever bought. Last a long time, and VERY nicely packages. Batteries are individually packaged into packs of 4 so that is very nice."
"So far so good, batteries work as they should."
"Batteries do not last! Don't waste your money on these. I've been using them in a weight scale where 4 batteries would last 4-6 months. With these batteries, I only get 10 days of usage. No battery life."
Only way I'll ever buy batteries again.
Dead on arrival...please stay away.
for the price they work fine.
"I have tried numerous brands of disposable batteries: big (costly) name brands, cheaper name brands,brands made companies that make electronics,ect.I would say these are better than the cheaper name brands ... But, not as good as the high dollar name brands. They fall in the middle, and for the price you really can't complain!!They are individually wrapped in packs of 4 , which is nice. We have used in Xbox remotes (last about 4/5 weeks with moderate use) Children's toys (seem to drain quicker in the toys) And portable CD players (average drain)Overall, I am happy with them and would definitely buy again!"
"they're batteries, they're cheap, and they work just fine"
"These batteries work great! No issue with battery life. I order this pack every few months to keep up with our computer mouse, video game controllers, and misc battery needs. Can't beat the price."
No complaints here! Very satisfied with these batteries. So far I've used them primarily in LED candles and they've worked great basically on continuously. I think they are comparable to the Kirkland brand that I normally use. I will buy again.
no complaints!
No complaints.
So far so good. I'll buy all my batteries from Amazon basics in the future.
"Works as good as the higher-priced, name-brand batteries. No complaints."
"Amazonbasics products so far haven't failed me now, no defectsGreat buy for batteries."
Works great. Just as good as name brand . Will get again
"I have been using these Amazon batteries in my remote controls in the living room and they seem to last a pretty good while. Cheaper than alot of the other high dollar brands with the same, if not better, result. Would buy again..."
"Work great! No leakage or discharge (so far) like we've had from some other store brand batteries. Not quite sure how long they hold up, but they seem to be doing as well as the name brand batteries."
"These batteries are certainly A+. They arrived quickly and are packaged in a box that you can easily open and close, so you don't have to have some fancy space contraption to contain them."
"In a box of 12 batteries, 4 worked for 2 months, 8 did not work at all, Total waste of money"
It only took my little demons 3 days to figure out how to jimmie this thing open. It was really great while it lasted though.
"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package."
Batteries popped open inside the motion detector lights making a mess and ruining the detector. I will never buy this brand again.
"Do not buy. Inconsistent quality, performance, some leak and ruin things."
Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.
They work great and a price nicely
Batteries work great. As expected. No issues with delivery or life span on batteries.
"These batteries worked just fine and unlike the last Energizer batteries, they didn't leak. I'll never buy Energizer again."
Good Deal for the price
Very pleased with these batteries. If you have children you know keeping a supply of batteries for all their toys is essential. These are about the same price as batteries in the dollar store but the quality of the big names. Will be buying more for years to come.
No need to spend money on large name brand batteries these work the same and i feel that last just as long and if they do not you get 3/4 the life span of a more expensive battery at a fraction of a price. Don't think just buy them
we will never buy any more!!!! they suck!!!!!
Batteries died after a week. Same appliance used Duracell batteries for half a year.
"Good price.... but (update 12/21/2016)Update - horrible batteries. Have gone through 8 out of 48 batteries and none have worked. Contacted Amazon, they state they will refund my money and apologized. Great customer service,but horrible product.Be aware of the refund/return policy with Amazon. Batteries are something I don't test when i get them, I assume they will work when I need them. Have never had a problem before now. When to put 2 AA's in an LED flashlight..... nothing. Tried 2 more.... nothing. Tried 2 more....nothing 2 more (guess what)... nothing again. Tried it my TV remote too. Same results. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outage.While the product gets 1 star (that's too generous) I do give Amazon and their Customer Service 5 Stars."
I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn't go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old addage You Get What You Paid For holds true.
"I like amazon products. But these haven't worked in any thing I've put them in. Nerf gun, toys.. nothing. Maybe they work in remotes....."
"No problems here! Using these for a variety of things, mostly just remotes and Xbox controllers though they have also been used in an external DSLR flash with no problems."
This is a lot of battery for really good price.
"It's true that these do not last as long as the big brands, especially in electronics (I opt for higher end batteries for things like my Mac mouse). BUT, the big brands are being knocked off all of the time. Even on this site, even with batteries purchased directly from Amazon, reviewers have found knockoffs.And knockoffs are not only a waste of money because they do not match the quality of the real brand, they can be dangerous. It is not unusual for knockoffs to lead acid into your equipment or device, and even to explode!So, I know that with AmazonBasics, I'm getting a safe and reputable brand.Perhaps if I were buying from a national bricks and mortar store, I would choose Duracell or Energizer. But on the web, AmazonBasics is the safe way to go."
"received the wrapping paper thank you.but no batteries ever came,nor were they in the package with my wrapping paper"
"Im sure these are fine batteries, but they never arrived, and theres no way for me to request a replacement."
"these apparently have been sitting around for some time, I used 2 in a TV remote and they were almost dead within just a few days. I exchanged the two for two more from the same pack, and again about 3-4 days later they were dead. hereafter I'll buy a name brand."
"These batteries don't have the power equal to Energizer or Duracell brands. If you get lucky and they power your device, they don't last very long. We still 3 unoped packs of 4 batteries each, but whenever we try them in most products, they do NOT work."
"Best battery buy in town. So far, no duds. I have been buying for the last 3 years and worth the price."
"unless they leak, this is a wonderful product"
"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas."
Basic performance didnt last a week in an AM radio.
"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose."
"Do not last as long as other cut price batteries. In my Canon digital camera I cannot get off more than 3 shots before the 'low-battery' warning comes on. I am going back to Maxell, which did much better for me.I would hate to see what the capacity of the AmazonBasics EveryDay batteries are!!!"
"YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE, BUT YOU CAN BEAT ME. WORKS WELL, ESPECIALLY WHEN GROUPED TOGETHER AND PUT IN A SOCK."
"poor performer, does not last long at all."
"I bought these because of all the ratings on Amazon but they don't last at all!! I am so disappointed. I used the in every device and every solar light and withing 2 months I have to replace them all. Now, with the the snow and cold, my yard is dark because I can't get out there. I will never buy these again."
"These are OK but they don't hold up or last very long. We bought these during Christmas hoping they would be great esp since alkaline but they barely hold up to the wear and tear of everyday use in a TV remote, let alone a kids toy."
"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Fast , good delivery."
Not as good as name brand but worth the price.
"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radios.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Noqw I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys."
Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.
"Don't last quite as long as name brand, but worth the money."
not bad
These are a good price. I don't feel they last very long. Perhaps they would be great in a remote or something that draws very little. I have them in my outdoor battery operated Christmas lights and I have had to replace them already (only 2 weeks of use). The name brand ones last all season.
"They don't last as long as the major brands, but for the price you can't beat it."
Doesn't last as advertised. Dead in no time!
"These batteries drain quickly. While you get a lot of them, the quality just isn't there. If you need reliable batteries, look elsewhere."
These are cheap and they Explode!!!!!! I was pumping at 2am and it exploxed in my pump. It leaked all over my pump and baby blankets!!!!! Ive never had this happen with name brand!!!!! Now I have to find time with a newborn to packed up all the batteries from all our baby items and return!! Not Cool!!
"They work and have a great price point.I haven't tested their capacity myself, but did spend a bit of time looking for reviews and stuff. These seem to be about on par with the Costco duracells. That's plenty fine for me and I really like the price and convenience.When you get right down to it, all I really care about with AA batteries is that I don't buy crap. These aren't crap."
They don't last as long as a Duracell but they are cheaper.
not even sure if the price and quantity you get are just as comparable than other leading brands. these seem not to hold a long lasting charge
"Despite what seems to be a great deal for a 48pack of AA batteries these aren't great. 2 stars only because of the deal as they're for light use. I use them only for my xbox controllers, I understand that the life is different with gaming (sucking up all the energy), but I've put a pair in before and about 2 weeks later had to change them. Not to mention, I have 2 controllers (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. This means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them. Overall, not great for gaming or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backups. I'll have to compare these to say Duracell, but from past experience I don't remember having to change them so often."
"Great battery, great price. NOT frustration-free though. Each row of 4 batteries was wrapped up so you had to open 12 packs individually."
i have bought the AA 48 packs twice now and they are terrible... They don't even last a month...
I ordered these batteries 2 months ago. I don't really have a lot of things that require AAA batteries. My tv remote finally died and I put in these batteries. And my remote tells me that these brand new batteries are low.
Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. What a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star.
"They do not last long. I literally added these to a flashlight that's typically never used. I used these batteries in that particular flashlight about 3 times for a total of maybe 3-4 minutes. I switched it on today, and the batteries are already almost depleted. I wouldn't purchase them again."
Been going through a pair a week in my Xbox One controller. I play about 4 hrs a day average so the performance is underwhelming.
"I used these in a mini led flashlight, which I use to walk my dog every night. I use the flashlight about 20-30 minutes every night and the batteries only last maybe 3 weeks."
They do not last as long and I had hoped. Meaning they run down really fast. Would not buy again.
"I'm a huge Amazon fan and I know the appeal here for most and me as well is the price but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and these do not last anything near the better more expensive batteries out that. If it's easy to change batteries then this is the way to go but if you have something it's difficult or a pain or you just don't want to the hassle I would suggest spending more and getting the upper brands, and by that I mean the more expensive, most expensive of the batteries out there, they really do last longer. It's a shame because you know they have the ability to make batteries last longer, all companies, and yet they don't just so we'll come back and buy more"
Great price but didn't last long at all.
"Ok for general use, but does not last long."
"These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remotes, clocks, battery-powered soap dispensers. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basics. Bought duracells at Costco. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. Don't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing."
"Triple A batteries , not much to say other than I was happy with the convenience that Amazon offers. No issues and am happy with my purchase"
I have a simple electronic keypad I use these batteries in. With the name brand I would go about 2 months. With the amazon brand i go 2 weeks. Not sure I am sold on this being an equivalent battery just yet.
My 8 pack batteries were NOT charged so if you are buying these for a trip or something be warned.
Arrived as advertised and ahead of schedule. Not quite as long lasting as a major name brand but good for the price point.
"Gave these a fair chance but the fact is they simply do not last as long as Duracells. I've gone through more than half of the pack I purchased and I am easily replacing batteries twice as fast for the same devices, same use. I won't repurchase."
"Some work, some don't. Some will power my TV remote but the same batteries wouldn't power a different type of remote. I won't buy these again."
"These are odd. Several times so far I have put them into some device and the circuit does not work so it seems dead. Tested the batteries with a tester and they read 1.6 volts, so they are fully charged. Put in energizers, duracells, that show 1.58 volts and the device works perfectly. Tried one of each brand and got mixed results. Good price but Ray o Vacs are about the same and no problem. I don't know what is wrong but for now, I don't like them."
"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY flameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocery store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. Don't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a bummer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that."
not so wonderful - I don't think these batteries last any longer than the ones I buy at the dollar stores.
Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.
Not suitable for toys. Drained within just a couple of days.
Not sure about these yet. The question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them. Will update later when i find out.
Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my headset. I won't be buying these again.
Not a bad price but after few times I realize these battery run out very fast. Amazon need to do better with that.
"Some loss power fast, in a TV remote."
"Marginal performance at best. Used one in my Turbo razor, and it died much earlier than other brands. It also dies quickly, with a steep power drop-off."
"I'm not too thrilled with the life of these batteries. They don't seem to last as long as energizer does. And in some things, they aren't even strong enough to get rid of the 'dead battery' reading."
"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before."
Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.
I have bought these several times thinking they were great but after longer term use have found they fail about twice as fast as Duracell. I will never buy them again and will not hold Amazon Basic in such A high standard. my next batteries will be Duracell
"What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!"
"I thought that this was a great deal, but the batteries don't seem to last very long. I feel like I am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote. I would equate these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries, but they are not of the highest quality."
I used these in my Xbox controller. Hardly ever lasted more than 2-3 weeks if I play regularly on weekends and a couple weekdays.
Don't seem to last as long as Duracell.
Worst batteries I have ever purchased. I use in the mouse to my laptop. Doesn't hold a charge for more than three days with limited usage (maybe 4 hours/day). Not worth the price.
"On second use, silver liquid leaked out of batteries, almost ruining the motor of a breast pump."
"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)"
"They seem to last just as long as the namebrand batteries. Since I have a grandchild that's got LOTS of battery powered toys, the more I can save on batteries, the happier I am."
Exceptional value. Shipped quickly. Well packaged. Nothing bad to say
Every time I brew a cup off coffee there are tons of coffee grinds in my coffee. I have cleaned my pot several times. Thank god I only have a few pods left. Will never buy this brand again!!!
Everybody's already talked about how great and dependable these batteries are - I bought these based on those reviews. Now I just wish AmazonBasics would put out coin batteries
"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac."
nothing special - seem to work just fine but won't know how they stand up to name-brand batteries for quite a while
Just batteries. Nothing special or bad about them.
"Nothing much unusual or extraordinary to say here: they're batteries, and they work fine. Probably only really worth it if you either are patient about shipping, or have Prime. Otherwise, you're not missing much by getting some batteries from the grocery store or somewhere vs. these."
Wow ! Let there be light !
If I ever need AA batteries too bad what I actually meant to get was AAA ... my fault.
Decent quality. Of course Great seller )
"Of the four used so far, two already lost charge, one so much as giving a negative read on a voltmeter."
They're the only batteries I use now. It's hard to beat the /battery cost. Every parent should have a stash of these and the Amazon AA's in their home.
We are very disappointed in the quality of Amazon's AA batteries. They have failed 3 or 4 times in various products we own. The most costlywas it's use in our small wall safe in our home. The 6 batteries failed after two months and we had to have a service open it at the tune of225.00. Another example was a radio and flashlights. We will have to throw the rest out.
Long lasting cheap batteries what more do you ent
Basic battery
good deal
Good value
How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!
I feel like they don't work as long.
"Love the price but for me,they just don't seem to last as long as my other brand."
ok
These seem to last almost as long as the pro cell.
Works ok
"Price is good but I don't think these batteries perform as well as their peers. Reading reviews from actual electricians, I think they agree.I love Amazon products but wouldn't buy these again (unless they were more than half off their competitor's prices)."
"I have a digital charger that has been very effective at recharging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a recharge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxell and others, I expected a more robust container."
Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.
"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK."
"OK, good price but don't expect Duracell longevity."
I buy a lot of these. I don't think that the longevity is exceptional but they are inexpensive in bulk. Worry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables
Don't seem to last very long changing brands
the charge holds a bit
They work
It seems the plus pole pins of these batteries are somewhat shorter than the poles of other brand batteries. The batteries didn't make contact in some of the devices I was planning to use them in.
THEY ARE OK.
Good product
"they seem to work well, not super impressed but sufficient."
The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.
They seem to die pretty fast.
Serves the purpose. Good for the price.
"Okay if you're using for household use, I tried to use with my speedlites for photography and these ran out entirely too quickly."
they ok same as others
"On average, these batteries do not last as long as the Energizer. They cost less to buy, but overall, there isn't much saving."
"No issues, unless I put them in backwards. Same quality but cheaper than the name brands"
Was very disappointed to see that one of my batteries corroded and leaked in a device within only a few days of placing it in the device. Will not purchase again.
"What can I say... I need them, they work, and they're less expensive."
"Going to keep my review short and brief, since the chances are that it will not be seen due to so many reviews already posted.If you're talking about rechargeable batteries, everyone knows that the Panasonic Eneloops are one of the best because they are the most reliable for discharging (usage, basically) and that they hold a lot of charge. While the non-rechargeable batteries do not measure in mAh, these Amazon Basic ones are very much comparable in every way. I found this to be extremely interesting since I have yet to see non-rechargeable batteries perform so well. Then I researched into this and found that they are made in Japan - the same place that the original Eneloop and Fujitsu batteries are made which are where the top notch AA or AAA batteries ever made."
"Bought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn't seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good."
5 of the batteries leaked from the package. Will not buy these again.
About 1/3 the life of energized or Duracell batteries.
All were dead
Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak
amazon sucks these batteries drain like the water in my toilet
"As soon as i place the new battery in my card alarm, ut says 1 bar charged"
Awful batteries don't work
Awful batteries.

"batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month"
Batteries very week. Would Not Work IN Several devices.
Batteries were weak and didn't last a week in remote

Don't waste your money. They last about 2 days in a wii remote.
Entire pack of batteries was dead!
garbage
Good price with ugly design.
Great price but these do not last very long.
Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option.
I feel like the batteries wasted quickly. It did not last as long as store bought batteries.
I have the wrong size batteries
i like amazon product.but this battery was not good.
I ordered AA
I used them for my Xbox 1 controllers. They do not last long compared to name brands.
"Idk why I ended up with AAA, when I orderd AA... Oh well"
Inconsistent. VERY short life.
"It didn't last for even one day,"
It goes off in week.
Junk wont charge
"Junk, they don't work"

LOVE THE BATTERIES.THANKS
More than half did not work
More then half did not work :(

None of them would recharge.
not good at all
Not happy at all very slow compare to others I ordered
"Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return."
Pretty sure they didn't really have a charge when they arrived
"Really good price for a reason, first two batteries I used were dead. Do not waste your money!"
"Save your money,these do not last half the time of Duracell"
Sent me old dead batteries
should buy duracell
Substandard...Dollar store batteries last longer
terrible
The capacity is suspect. I seem to have gotten a lot more out of Energizer.
The products that it was delivered but I could not find it anywhere
"These are absolute junk. I'm half way through the pack and so far every single battery has leaked.UPDATE:Ok, these batteries are horrible. Every single battery leaked, ruining some of the items they were in. In almost 30 years of buying from Amazon these batteries are the most disappointing thing thing I've ever received.Amazon, in case you are interested the lot number is JK150601"
These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.
"These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast"
These batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity.
These batteries do not last or work well. Spend the extra buck and buy Duracell.
these batteries do not perform as good as the cheapest ones on the market.
these batteries don't last very long
these batteries explode - terrible quality
These batteries have a very short life. Need replaced every week. Used ina solar light outside Very unsatisfactory
These batteries have an extremely short life. Below Amazon's standards.
"These batteries suck!!!!!!Stay away from them! Read bad reviews, they last only weeks."
These did not fit my device...
These did not last long at all.
These die way too fast.
These do not last long. Will never buy again
These suck. Had for a week. Stopped working. Garbage.
these were dead on arrival
theses batteries don't last very long not worth the money
they are not good as described. the power is easy to be used out.
they are terrible
"They are too cheap, please buy rechargeable batteries instead of wasting the environment!"
They die quickly
They do not last
they don't hold a charge like the top brands do.
They don't hold a charge very well.
They don't last. I would not buy again
They don't work and are dead!!!!!!
They fail earlier than brand names. I assumed Amazon would match in beat others. I won't order again.
they let for about 5 recharges
They lost power within minutes in digital cameras.
They paired these with a order that uses AA
They were dead. I'm baffled.
This is not what I received.
took WAY to long to receive. and then some were corroded.
Tore within one week and is baby blue and very shear not green.
Trash. Only lasted a few hours.
Tried them in 2 flashlights. Neither worked.
Used these for 2 insta bulb lights purchased from here also and they last about a week. Crazy!!!
"Utterly worthless, no staying power."
very cheap batteries
very disappointed in these!
Very dissappintes with these. Have had to replace almost all of them.
Very weak batteries
Wore out way to fast
Worst batteries ever....they work once and drain out...you try to use something again and the battery is dead!
Worst batteries I've ever bought.
Worst battery I've ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!!
Wrong Item
I only buy batteries from Amazon. Love the Duracell Procell deals but the Amazon branded batteries seem just as good. No way can I score these deals locally.
Not much to say about batteries but I really love the Amazon Basics products. Great price and same performance as Duracell or similar popular brands.
Amazon never ceases to amaze me...maybe thats why i ONLY shop on here! Thee batteries have great life and price. Bye bye duracell or energizer!
"I bought these batteries to put into my bluetooth wireless speaker so that I didn't have to always have it plugged into it's AC power source. After only an hour of using my speaker with these batteries, my speaker died! I'm sad and disappointed that the batteries only managed to give me an hour of listening through my speaker, and honestly I'm shocked too. I read a lot of great reviews for these batteries and unfortunately, for me it did not deliver the quality that I wanted and needed :(."
What can I say here. These batteries are fantastic. I'll never pay for brand name batteries again. This is the only way to go!!!
I have used AmazonBasics batteries in the past and they are the only ones I order now. For the price per battery you wont get a longer lasting battery!
THESE BATTERIES ARE VERY GOOD PRICE LAST VERY GOOD WHILE. USE THESE ALL THE TIME
These are great. We get them using the subscribe and save to get an additional 15 off!! You can't beat that price for a good battery
ordered the batteries with the LED lytes
Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
Ordered these for items i received from Amazon and they were packagedwell and preformed perfectly. Will definitely order moreAmazonBasics batteries. Da HYP
"Best price for a none name brand battery, however, they last just as long as name brands for a pack of batteries."
I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.
Much better quality than the Eveready batteries I normally purchase at a discount store. My telephone headset eats through batteries which is why I don't like to spend too much on them - the first time I used these batteries they outlasted them!
"Whoever makes these, Great job they last and last and do not leak. We have been buying them for a year now and not a bad one in the bunch."
"Great batteries for an outstanding price! Order here, not through your local store - you'll regret it! It's nothing better than having a drawer full of batteries, too, for those last-minute needs!"
Outstanding product....well made....high quality...no complaints here
"At .28 cents a battery...and free two day shipping if you are a Prime member this AA Battery deal is a no brainer! There is nothing else in a retail store near me that can match this deal.The batteries are first rate alkaline, and so far have been working great in all the gadgets I have put them in. I have started buying all my batteries from Amazon. The prices and quality just can't be beat."
Outstanding value. They came fast too! Will purchase again. No need to go into Costco and wait in the long lines just for batteries.
"Haven't used them, they look fine. Probably overpaid. They arrive in a fancy cardboard box, like they're collectibles or something."
Batteries made it here safe and undamaged.
Packaging of the product is perfect. Often when buying batteries in bulk they are not separated. These came in a small box with perfectly wrapped batteries.
packed in 4.
This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.
NOT MUCH POWER IN THESE BATTS
I waited to write this review until I had tried nearly all of the batteries that I ordered. Most of them did not have any power in them. The few that did work lasted maybe an hour. I pitched the remaining 6 because I cannot depend on them at this point. Maybe I just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries I have ever used. I would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience.
These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk
"I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days."
"Having had a problem with Duracell batteries, (most of them destroyed electronic items of mine, even leaking in the original wrapper) I noticed that the cheap Chinese batteries that come with items have given me no problem. I decided why should I pay the price for a name brand and have practically every one start leaking (all before the use by date). So far these batteries have been just fine. I'll continue to use them and check the condition a little more often."
You get what you pay for. These batteries are cheap and don't last as long as Duracels or Energizer. If I had to estimate I'd say they last around 50 as long as those mentioned.
"Now I know why these are so inexpensive! I'm baffled as to how they've earned such high reviews. I've used them in a variety of devices portable LED lights that I utilize maybe once every two months for events, in a battery-operated soap-dispenser, in tap lights in a closet/hallway, in toys... In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months. What a wasteful, useless product!"
"Not sure why I purchased so many batteries, but it is a wonderful feeling knowing that I have so many if needed."
Perfect packaging. Great price. Perf.
"I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries."
Came in handy for the holidays. All toys sent n with batteries.
Great batteries.
Great to have a load of extra batteries when you have children who use battery operated toys.
Inexpensive and works great!! We plow through batteries with three kids and every damn toy that is battery driven.
Item as described. Fast delivery. Perfect.
"Nice to have spare batteries when needed. At the price it is a great value, but they do not last as long as the Duracell but then those are 3x as much money. So for the price I feel this is an excellent deal. Very happy with these batteries.Highly Recommend!"
So far so good. And a very attractive price
what a deal
work perfectly
Perfect all those little things! If you are using high-drain devices please buy AmazonBasics pre-charged NiMh rechargeable batteries and a charger such as the 16-bay titanium charger!
Very nice item item as described delivered on time very prompt will shop again
Who doesn't need a pack of batteries Economical and last a long time. I keep mine in the freezer and have never had a problem with them not being fully charged.
Absolutely perfect case for a near-perfect phone. This case fits perfectly.After a few days of use you'll forget you have a case on the phone.The phone's smooth rounded edges make it near impossible not to drop the phone occasionally. This case is a must for the LG v20.The quality of this case is the best I have ever seen in a smartphone case.Well done!
"These work great! Very, Very Long lasting. Arrived early."
"Perfect for our emergency survival basement pantry. I haven't opened the box, and just sealed them in plastic."
Works like a charm.Some batteries were already dead/not charged at the factory.When they are being used they carry a acceptable long charge
They work well in my Xbox controllers.
Perfect for keeping my wireless mouse and other electronics around the house working. It's always good to buy in bulk since they tend to go fast seeing as how I have a lot of electronics.
I order these A LOT! works perfect for my son's toys and last as long as the major brands an so much cheaper. Also the packaging makes storage easy as well.
Perfect for my needs.
"Excellent value. These come packaged in little sleeves of four in a large cardboard box. Amazon Basics batteries have always been good performers. We've been using them for a couple of years and haven't had any issues with them drying up quickly or being lackluster upon first use. Nice quality, great deal."
"Always great to get AA batteries in bulk. Everything uses these things, we have like 20 remotes that are constantly chewing up batteries as well as flashlights and small candles. These work great and came at a great price. What more could you ask for"
"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk."
"We got these for our TV remote. We didn't need such a large package, but it was the cheapest option, so we went ahead and purchased the 20 pack. It was great to be able to save money over the name brands, and since it was Amazon brand, we figured they would be good quality (and we were right). It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed."
As far as performance goes they seem to be holding up well. They deliver the correct amount of power and work just fine in all the devices that require this size. Cannot beat the price on these.
Works well without spending an arm and a leg for the same thing!!!
You can trust Amazon to bring you great products at great price
Only battery's we buy anymore
As advertised.
Best deal for batteries out there. They last forever in kid's toys!
Great batteries at a great price. No complaints at all.
"Great price! These batteries work great. They're delivered in a nice sturdy box and packaged in groups of four, which is very convenient. Can't beat the price either."
Lots for very little. These are great batteries to have on hand.
perfect!
These batteries are great and long lasting. I refilled every little flashlight and wish I had more to spare.
Great batteries at a great price!
Wow! What a great price!
"Loving this amazon basics line! Great prices and I believe the Amazon brand works just as well as any. I bought these huge cases of batteries because I'm moving soon and I wanted to stock up. You get A LOT for your money! I like how these are wrapped because I specifically need them to store for emergencies, and I don't have to worry about them leaking.Just get the Amazon brand!"
Hard to beat for the price. Shipped fast and fresh.
"They all come in a box wrapped 4 in a bunch. You always have newly packaged batteries and not a mess rolling around, like the ones energizer sells that are all put together. Don't last as long as Energizer but still pretty long!"
Perform as predicted
Excellent batteries! Even better than some name-brand overpriced ones we've bought
"Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Read all the possitive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Dont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Clocks would be ok. Expect 1/2 the performance of the leading brands."
"I have been pleasantly surprised by the performance of all of the AmazonBasics products that I've purchased, and this is no exception.Battery life on par with traditional Energizer alkaline batteries, for a fraction of the price. Yes, please!"
"Cant beat it.. performs just as good if not better than the big brands, at more than half the cost.. Life span is awesome thus far.. ill never buy from the big guys again."
These batteries are fantastic! They perform just as well as any other name brand battery but they cost significantly less. I never have any worries with any Amazon branded item and these do not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks and get these batteries.
Great quality for the price. Will buy again.
Pleasantly surprised with these batteries. Powered my son's toy tablet quite well along with other remote control cars that they use.
Buy these. They do not last at all.
Pleased with the performance of these batteries.
"Great battery. They last as long as any other, I see. Great price, too."
Amazing quantity of durable batteries at excellent price.
"Great price, however battery life is not comparable to other brands."
"After receiving this box of batteries, as we made our way through them, we realized that the batteries were all close to dead. Now we are past the return date. Not buying these again. Would give zero star rating if I could."
"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!"
"I compared these against the Costco Kirkland brand and was quite disappointed with the Amazon Basic AA batteries. I used these in a flashlight test and after two hours, the Costco brand still worked fine, but the Amazon Basics were close to dead. I'm very disappointed with this brand and won't buy it again. For short term use, it's fine, but they don't last over time."
Terrible life. These are poorest quality batteries I have ever purchased both AA and AAA
Batteries leaked when in charging station.
Don't think they were as good as the ones I get at Dollar Tree. I will not buy again they were a waste of money
These batteries are very poor quality and do not last even half the time of standard Energizer or Duracell batteries
Horrible quality. These last 4 to 6 days in an Xbox controller and maybe 10 days in a remote. Horrible quality.
these are junk. you get a large quantity but they are not long-lasting and sometimes need to be changed after only a few hours of continuous use.i do not recommend these and will not purchase them again.
"Bought these and regret it. I must have gotten a bad batch since these were lasting only three weeks in my smoke detectors. After a few weeks, all smoke detectors using them started beeping like they are low on power. A battery tester confirmed the batteries were low. I replaced them with store-bought Rayovac batteries and haven't had any issues."
"Your milage may vary. My milage is after being recharged less than ten times, two different sets of the batteries rapidly lost capacity to hold charge (from full to empty in 30 seconds) and leaked, each time in a different devices, damaging at least one of them.. I'm hesitant to try any more of them.My opinion garbage.I have been using rechargeable batteries for years. Frys' no name, Energizer and Duracell all worked great. The AmazonBasics are no where near the level of the these brands in regards to quality."
"Multiple batteries leaked, ruining one toy and causing messes in other items. Poor quality."
Batteries working great so far. I threw the box in my freezer and take out what i need when i need them.
No complaints
"THE POWER! Yup, they work. No defective ones. They last as long as name brand AA batteries."
They work and were very affordable.
Great price lasts a long time. I stock up. Kids toys all seem to need batteries
"Uhhhhh, loads of batteries at a good price."
Great deal and price....
So far these have worked great and fit the need well.
Cost effective power.
Great deal on AAA batteries. I recommend.
Perfect price and convenience. I needed some for walkie-talkies I got for my grandkid's and this will last them a little while.
Tested at a higher voltage than other new AAA batteries and well worth the price
These batteries work as I expected.
Long lasting batteries at a great price. I would purchase them again.
How can you go wrong with batteries from Amazon You can't!
"Are a gift , haven't given yet"
Enough batteries to last quite a long time at a discounted price.
"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying!"
I did a simple test with 2 identical falmeless candles that run on 2 AAs. Amazon Basics AA kept the candle going as long and bright as brand new Energizers. Pretty darn good deal!!
"These were super reasonably priced. They last about as long as the dollar store ones, so if you have wall clocks or remotes that need 'em, you're good. If you have high-drain stuff, they'll burn up pretty quick. But it's still cool to have tons of AAs on hand."
So far so good. I haven't noticed them dying fast so they are much better than your off brand cheap knock off ones. We shall see how long they last.
"I was surprised, pretty good batteries!"
Sent these to my grandson to go with the gifts I sent him for Christmas. His mom was thrilled because there were more than enough batteries to accomodate his remotes etc.
"I bought these batteries as back ups. I normally use rechargeable AA Batteries. I got tired of being the only person in my house to recharge batteries as soon as they die and of people taking my charged batteries out of my controller. I only ordered an 8 pack and have had to use them in a dvd remote, my controller and two thermostats (yep, they both decided to die on me at the same time). I can't tell a difference between these AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries and the name brand ones I normally buy. For the price these are pretty good batteries."
"We use them on a battery operated fan on high. Fan says on high will run for about 11 hours before needing new batteries. These last for two nights, after first night it is running down but still keeps going. Pretty cool"
"Not bad. I cannot verify how awesome they are, but I'm not complaining about dead batteries all the time, so they must be pretty good."
"Very long lasting, pretty sure I'll order again sometine"
"Good price, time will tell on durability"
Price and Quality Tops
price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up..
Order these regularly. Work very well. Price is great as with 3 kids replacing batteries often.
Great batteries for great price.
"Great price on necessary item, seems to have environmentally friendly packaging. They are easy to store, as the box is flat and about the size of a small book. Performance of the batteries has been unremarkable, I don't have a sense that they last longer or shorter than any others and I've no convenient way to assess that. I'd prefer a built-in battery-life indicator, but that would surely increase the price, and I can just use a battery tester. I noticed that a favorite YouTube tech reviewer Linus Sebastian uses them, and he's a frugal fellow that reassures me that I made a good choice. I recommend them."
"Ok, batteries but can't beat the price"
GOOD QUILTY PRICE GREAT
Best price I could find anywhere. Not sure on performance yet.
"What can I say about batteries, they work, priced well."
Priced well and work great.
I haven't even used one yet but I suspect they will work. I stocked up on these because I have a lot of stuff that uses AAA's and it is a super price.
Not quite the performance I would expect from a product that Amazon puts it's name on. A bit dissapointed.
"When I opened the pack and put them in a device, it already said battery low."
Product as described
This is sth i never had with other serious brands. disappointing and returning
Batteries
Trying to contact seller. Product very tarnished and rusty like it's been used or very old. Very disappointed by appearance and quality
Pros*Good quality*Good valueCons*None
So far so good testing fully charged
purchased in sept 2015 went to change because light was not working . batteries leaked and ruined a special optical light . now checking all other light they are in .
"this was an ouststanding deal. I bought it through Alexa voice order. since I didn't get the Alexa price for some reason, I contacted amazon customer service and Amazon corrected the problem quickly, without more information and effort on my part. I *love* that about amazon.the batteries were in a plain box, wrapped in four packs. I often buy amazonbasics, both for the quality and the simple, clean packaging. I use a lot of aa batteries in items that do not work with my rechargeables. I don't mind finding space for 48. in fact the box of 48 requires just a little more space than a 20-24 pack of other batteries since other batteries use more packaging.put these in your wish list or save for later in your cart and watch for a great price to buy them."
Put these into a high power flashlight and took my dog out. Within ten minutes the flashlight was so dim that it was worthless. I would never buy these again!
"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."
Quality batteries.
These batteries seem to hold up as well as any other batteries I've used and they are cheaper than the name brand batteries I had been using.
"I purchased AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading brands out there. They are also much more affordable. We have used them in everyday items that need batteries. We mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. This pack has lasted awhile."
These are good quality batteries!
I bought these basically because they are by Amazon and I love and trust their brand to produce high quality products. So I bought packs of AA and AAA when I bought some flashlights on Prime Day. They seem to work great and I expect they will last a long time.
Easy to open and store . . . equivalent battery life with more expensive brands!For those of us who do not like 'real' shopping These are Amazon Prime 2 day delivery.
Quality and Quantity worth every penny
delivered on time.
Basic batteries at a good price. It is such a convenience to have them delivered to me. I will be reordering them for sure.
Quality batteries at a great price.
Great batteries. Work and last like brand name batteries
"Quality batteries, great price. Perfect buy for a household with toddlers. Also the packaging is great-easy to keep the new batteries in and use when needed. No loose batteries rolling around everywhere once you open it."
"These batteries get the job done for a reasonable price. While I haven't done extensive comparative testing, these seem to last about as long as the typical name brands."
Batteries are so expensive. It's great that Amazon came out with their own brand that is cost effective and has great quality! I've only used a few of them so far but they are definitely long lasting! Will reorder again.
very good
"I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I've ever used. They'd last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again."
"I purchased an 8-pack back in April. I used 2 right away in a remote and put the remaining 6 up in a cabinet. Last night (3 months later) I went to replace batteries in another remote and all 6 were dead. I purchased another box of batteries from a local store, installed them in the remote the remote worked great. Definitely a quality issue on some of these batteries based on other reviews."
"I knew that Amazon had essentials for sale, but I never thought they would be selling batteries! Much cheaper than name brands out there and have been just as good to me. None has been a dud on me so far so I'm pretty satisfied."
"I needed some regular batteries to toss into random things where my rechargeables normally get lost and forgotten. Normally I prefer amazon's brand, but these white batteries were just not that great. Some of them barely worked. They were very inconsistent."
"Great batteries, especially for the price. I buy all my batteries through Amazon now."
"For small amount of money, one gets quality AND quantity...really satisfied :)"
"Quality seems good. I just wish the buttons lit up on the bagel and frozen buttons. Also, the slots aren't long enough or deep enough for a good sized bagel."
To be honest...these batteries outperformed a big name brand. Period.
I think the price is really good for the amount. But I feel the battery life is not as long as my preferred choice of battery. Will go back to my original choice of batteries.Besides that I did not have any issues with them and they are perfectly good working batteries.
"These batteries are very iffy. I have Mag-Lite's that require 3 AAA batteries and they have always drained the batteries equally, not with these batteries. I tried using my Mag-Lite this AM and it was dead. Did I leave it on and set it on it's end Nope. I checked the batteries and 2 of them were still good, but the 3rd wouldn't even register any voltage. This has happened 3 times with 2 different Mag-Lite XL200's and these batteries.Will not purchase again."
"I thought I was getting a great deal, but I learned the hard way if you don' use them up quickly, they go dead in a hurry. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk if you don't plan to use them w/ in 6 mo.s. If your using them in medical equipment, I'm sorry to say I'm choosing another battery. I don't like bashing an Amazon product and there's always the chance I got a bad batch but in this instance, (medical equipment) you want power when you need, I had several groans from the bfrnd about his TV remotes eating up his batteries, I thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well, so I bought another mouse, but when I put 2 fresh packs in my ten's unit 4 ea. time they started out weak then didn't last 15 min ea.. set it's time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in. I did test the one's I took out before putting the new one's in. I didn't think to test them before putting them in....."
I've been ordering these since Amazon started to provide their own product as having a 1 year old means you always need to have batteries available at the drop of a hat! Never had any issues and always fast fulfillment on Amazon's end!
Great deal for our office's most popular battery.
Quick delivery of a good product.
Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with AA size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them! I tried it once before and pretty much melted down the item and destroyed the batteries as well. Apparently they are not made to supply as much current and they will let out the (magic) smoke. These came in quickly and are just what I needed
I saw reviews for batteries on the news and these were rated among best. I'm so glad I can get these from Amazon in bulk for a great price.
"Haven't used many of them yet, but the two or three have have used seem to be fine."
Last as long as the brand names at a fraction of the price.
"As far as batteries go, these are just as good as any others you'll find in the store. They do the trick! So far, I've been super excited about the Amazon Basics stuff that has been coming out and have been satisfied with everything I've tried from them. Can't wait to try some more stuff."
"I am not a bettery expert nor an electrician. There are a few things that I consider when shopping for a battery - shelf life, price and brand. When you buy a brand product, you are most certainly guaranteed a good long lasting battery. Hence I always bought energizer or Duracell. Amazon is also a big brand so I decided to give it a try and to be honest with you it's a great battery. Price wise, it's cheaper than other name brands. One other andvreallyninportant factor is the shelf life. This battery has a shelf life of ten years, while a lot of batteries have 5 year shelf life. This is important for someone who uses batteries on a less frequent basis, such as for remote control. I started using batteries more frequently since I have a ton of baby toys now and a lot of them require batteries.One thought that came to mind while I was writing this review is that I just wanted to share a quick and easy way to check if battery is dead or not. All you need to do is hold the battery over flat surface (let's say kitchen countertop) at one or so inches high and drop it vertically on the flatter side. If it drops and falls over it is dead. If it falls and stays vertical it is still good to go. A friend of mine told me this trick and it totally works!"
Best battery deal ever. Lasts a long time
really good price for good batteries not the best but at a ourth of the price ..ill take theses any day
Good quality and long lasting batteries. No problems and I will order again.
These are a great price based on others I've seen. They additionally have a very good life cycle based on individual price point as compared to more expensive brands.
"Really great value for batteries. So far have tried 12 of the 48 batteries I ordered and they are all working perfectly fine just like Alkaline batteries should. The box they came in was great and I love the no frills specialty that Amazon gives with these. There's no forced marketing on you to buy more of their batteries and the packaging was great. The price was fantastic for the 48 pack which would normally cost at least 5 - 10 more at a retail store for 24 batteries.Like I said, performance-wise these are great. I may order some of the rechargeable batteries in the future."
I bought an amope foot roller thingy and it was so weak I almost threw it away but hubby said to just change the batteries bc they were probably old. I put in some rayovac ones I had that were brand new and made it weaker than the ones already in it. I had just ordered these batteries bc of a great deal that was going on. I put them in the amope and they were very strong! I have to say I was surprised.
"They've been great batteries so far, since my wife uses a TI-84 and goes through duracells like no one's business. So, the subscribe and save feature saves me from getting yelled at for not having any batteries in the house, as well as she seems to be getting a bit more juice from them.Definitely recommended, especially if you're currently buying batteries from box stores."
"I really wanted to love the Amazon AA batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage. As a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 AA batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tester, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skip these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The 2nd light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tester shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours."
"So far, so good. I like how Amazon provides reliable basics that I can easily order through Prime and save myself a trip to the store."
Nice batteries for a fair price. I purchased these to include 3 new batteries for each mini flashlight I add to the Operation Christmas Child Shoe Boxes that are sent to over 100 countries for children in need. I will have 1 battery in each flashlight and 2 spares for the child.
These batteries work great although they don't last super long they do last a good amount of time. not only that they are budget-friendly
These were very reasonably priced.
Great value...
ship quicly work great
"I am not going to lie, these batteries are pretty good, they last a long time and they have a good price tag. I have noticed that these last very slightly little less time then higher brands but for the money I would recommend."
They seem to work well and with a 10 year shelf life why buy in two and 4 packs when you can save money like this.
"Work very well, lots of power."
"these batteries are better then the energizer that i brought before, they last longer and have more power. I am very satisfied and would recommend"
Excellent buy. Hold up well.
Good Value. Very happy with performance.Don G.
Great value and lightning fast delivery!
"Product works as advertised, no issues. Recommended."
"These have served us well here, batteries that recharge are economical for us in our family of four. Especially with two toddlers and all of their toys.When these are priced affordably, I can definitely recommend them to everyone. Makes my wallet happy when I find affordability and performance in a product being used constantly in our home."
"When I heard one of the consumer gurus on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the generic or lesser known brands of batteries were often as good as the name brands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other brands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosion. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries."
"The life of these batteries is really astonishing, I bought these quite a while ago and we still have so many left. I was tired of buying small packs at the store, just to run out a couple weeks later. These batteries last long and the fact that I can buy them in packs of 100 is honestly the best feeling."
"Last fairly long, comparable to other batteries I have purchased in the past. They come neatly in a cardboard box and are a steal for the price."
"I have switched to AmazonBasics brand after trying just about every brand there is. Good, reliable batteries."
"Great Amazon Basics quality at a terrific price. I've come to rely on Amazon Basics for superb prices and dependable, excellent quality."
"Quality and battery life is the same as name brand. Reminds me of the days when you could go to Radio Shack and get some good, inexpensive batteries. So far, I haven't had an AmazonBasics products I haven't liked."
Long lasting product good bang for your buck.
So far they seem to last and work very well.
Seem to last as long as any other battery of this size and a good price.
These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...
"These batteries are safe for children, because it features an anti-leakage style. Plus, it's eco-friendly so it's not just good for your child, buy also in your surrounding."
Same life as Duracell for a lot cheaper.
"So far they're holding up just like the brand name versions, but they're much cheaper."
We go through loads of batteries in kids toys. These last just as long as the best name brand. Save yourself money and buy these. I always do.
Good price and arrived on time. Waiting to see how long they last
good value
Product as listed. Satisfied with purchase. Would buy again.
Love the price. They seem as good as Duracells.
"Perfectly respectable battery.I have been using Duracell batteries almost exclusively since I first went to sea in the 1970s. No complaints then. Still no complaints.I bought some of these AmazonBasics batteries just to try them out. Nothing scientific--other reviewers have done that well enough.Basically I'm satisfied. When I'm at sea I'll probably stick with Duracells, but these Amazon Basics are getting the job done at home."
"Cheap, works, better quality then duracel."
Good as Rayovac
"OMG, best value on batteries we found."
"Don't seem to last as long as the big name brands, however, for the price you will get more run time per money spent."
Every bit as good as the high end brands but at a price that is more affordable. We use these in Halloween displays and know that the copper ones last about 3.5-4 hours these made it the same amount of time.
"Save your money, they don't last very long"
Junk...save your money... totally useless batteries that last hours if that.
These batteries leak not satisfied!
"These batteries work as long, if not longer, than the big name batteries. I love them! I swear by them in my remotes for my TV, sound system, Blu-Ray player, TiVo, and Roku!"
"Ordered these for my son's remote control truck. Put them in both trucks and within a week the batteries in both trucks exploded, ruining both of them. So not only am I out the money I spent on the batteries I have to buy a new truck that costs 50. Spend the extra money and buy Duracell!"
Work as well as any of the top brands. Recommend them.
"So... One day I was camping in the Wild West on the Rocky Mountains in Colorado... I was carrying my trusty Power Rangers limited edition collectors sword. Out of nowhere... A bear attacked me. I grabbed my trusty sword, but it was out of batteries so it did not make the swoosh sounds that adds to the effect of my swing. So I hurriedly went to my trusty AmazonBasics AA batteries, and switched out the ones in my Power Rangers sword. My swooshing sounds were amazing, and I escaped with my life (not my leg but that's okay). Thank you AmazonBasics AA Batteries for saving a life."
"I love the money Amazon brand saves us, these batteries work and last just as well as name brand!"
Work great for my wireless apple keyboard and mouse.JoseCARDS vs. DICE - Strategically Lucky - Addicting Card Dice Game
"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."
Important Part missing - the power cordStained and 2 different colored remotesNot acceptable
Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.
These seem to last as long as any named brand battery. I'm not sure what will happen with corrosion in the long term storage items - I'll post more if they show corrosion issues.
seem fine. doing the job. haven't had long enough to know if they'll last as long as name brands.
Seem like good batteries and a fair price.Just seems like they are always out of stock and thentakes a long time to ship them out when the do have them.
Seem like normal batteries to me
Seem okay. Too soon to tell.
Work very well and seem to last
"Seem to last , time will tell will up date later."
Seem to last/perform as well as the other brand you're thinking of right now and probably a better price. At least that's why I ordered them again.
Seem to be working out as promised. I just purchased them within the lst month and used reviews of others to choose them.
They seem to work as well as name brand batteries. Good price
Seem to work fine
"Seem to work just fine. Just as good as the big name brand batteries from what I can tell, maybe a bit better.I like the packaging."
batteries are batteries. Seemed like a good price
Seemed to die very fast.I only purchased amazon batteries about 6 months ago and already replaced them in more than one device that should last quite a bit longer.Noticed the same for the AAA
"seems just as good as higher-priced batteries. I have had good experience with an AmazonBasics wireless mouse I've been using for 1 1/2 years, and the reviews for these batteries are excellent. For the price, I am fully satisfied."
Seems like a very good buy
"expiration of 2026, about 9 years in advance of when I received these.Batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of 5 which is good to provide for protection from discharge after part of the package is opened."
"I ordered a 20 pack of AA batteries from amazon when they were on sale. Seems like my kids are going through batteries like crazy with their gaming controllers and such. My household ends up going through AA batteries like there is no tomorrow! So when i saw these were on sale, i had to order some. I decided to hide these ones from the kids, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. So far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his xbox controller for days now and they are still going strong. Same with the wii controller- which has a battery indicator even, still says full battery. So far, i am very happy with these batteries and plan to purchase more in the future!"
Seems like quality varies. Some of the batts work great and las long and in the same device some fail quickly
They're batteries and they work. Use them for camping lights.
Bout to go with an rc truck. Seems to be holding power as good as Energizer
Seems to be working as well as the duracell ones that I purchase from Costco. Comparable value and I didn't have to go to the store for them!
So far these batteries seem to hold up decently compared to more expensive name brands. Time will tell.
seems to last as long as other batteries.
Seems to work fine
"Great Bargain, were shipped on time and the packing was good with no damage, happy customer"
Several if these were dead but majority are good
"A gift, she is very happy with them!!"
as good as Duracell and the Bunny
Shipped fast and so far lasting like other major brand batteries.
Cheaper than buying at WallyMart and sent directly to my home! Shipped quickly and in a nice packaging. They have lasted pretty well so far. This bundle was better than the packs you see in stores that promise an additional 5 free batteries. Got more for my buck and they work greatly. Def. would recommend.
"Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with."
short battery life
They don't last very long.
"Cheap batteries, but they don't last long for me. I've been using them in my fire tv remote. I have to replace them every month. The batteries before these lasted for 6 months for comparison."
Didn't seem to last long
Noticed short life and not enough power for some items
These batteries do not have a long life.
These things only last about a week in a Roku remote I will not be reordering.
"They had such positive reviews, I suppose it's possible that I got a bad batch. I've bought the Maxcell brand quite a bit which is slightly cheaper than these and I 'd compare them to Rayovak, not quite Duracell, but good. These lasted less than half as long, crazy! I had high hopes as an Amazon fan. Sad."
they last about half as long as duracell batteries do. they are cheap but they are not worth it.
They really don't last very long
Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don't waste your money.
"I was disappointed with these batteries. I thought they were going to be a higher quality and work as well as the name brand batteries. I bought these to use in my sons' leapster GS explorers. My sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes. These batteries don't even last 3 days. 8 hrs of use at the most! Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer. Time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables. Do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock."
"We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don't waste your money, Buy Duracell instead."
"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it."
"They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long."
Batteries don't last very long
These batteries don't last long at all.
Dont last very long
They didn't last the Christmas season....not even half of it.
In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required. Digging deeper alkaline batteries only last as long as they retain the upper percentage of their voltage. Either I have a bad batch or these degrade quickly in remotes. I plan on asking Amazon why this basic is so short lived in peak voltage retention.
"10 year storage life is a joke. I had some that I purchased only 8 months ago and when I went to use them, they already have zero juice left in them. I double checked with a battery tester and got zippo - zero. Not recommended."
"So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term."
These batteries seemed to last about half as long as (Wegmans) store-brand AA batteries. Not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing that it's so many in a package. Disappointing.
"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one."
"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."
"should have bought the bigger pack, used most of these up already, forgot how much stuff I had that uses AAA batteries."
"These are just as good as Duracell or Eveready brands. So much cheaper to subscribe to these than giving up the big bucks at the store, and having to run out and get them too."
"I love AmazonBasics items - they're just the basics and do their job. These batteries are no exception. The price is good, and the battery life is on par with other manufacturers. I'm happy with these."
Can't beat for the price. Simple packaging and performs like any there battery.
"Simple, basic batteries. They do the job and they do it well. The charge is on par with many of the brand name batteries. A little bit more expensive than what I would prefer and that is why I give it 4 stars."
"A high quality product, right up there with any of the main name brand batteries. These batteries are long lasting, and reliable. Though the order is a bulk one, these are shrink wrapped into packs of 4, which is super convenient for grab and go situations. I would recommend this product, and I will buy again!"
"Very convenient, high quality, good price. Why not subscribe"
I use AA batteries in my double electric breast pump. I usually have to replace Duracell every 3-4 days but these I had to replace every 24 hours or so. Truly did not last long!
"So far so good. Only had these for ten days, and they work just great.Here is an update on these batteries. Having purchased a couple sets of these over time, I can honestly say you get your moneys worth with these batteries. I am not compensated in any way for my reviews, it is just an honest review of this product."
"Small for size,, and already separating from waistband. Will not buy again."
"I purchased plastic battery storage cases for the batteries I had been purchasing that came on a flat piece of cardboard covered by a plastic lid. When I lifted the plastic to get a battery, other batteries tumbled out and soon I had a mess in my battery drawer. However, Amazon's batteries are very special from the minute you receive it. They arrive in a small cardboard box that just fits in your hand and opens easily from the top for removal of a battery or two. They will never fall out of the box and make a mess. I have not had a problem with using the batteries like I did when purchasing a brand from a big box store that carried its name -- the batteries leaked inside my TV remote control and made a white stain on the top of my entertainment center. Since I use the remote every day, the batteries were not left alone long enough for this to happen but it did. I went around the apartment removing those batteries from every item I own and did not want to be ruined, cleaned the mess inside the remote and vowed never to purchase batteries from that store again -- not even the name brands they often sell -- my revenge on the store for causing a white mark on my furniture -- a petty but satisfying act that was my small way of paying back. Amazon goes to great pains to see that its shipments come in containers that are easy for its customers to open and I appreciate that and am happy to see that they have carried that philosophy to include even small boxes containing their AmazonBasics Batteries. Good Job Amazon and thank you."
"Rechargeable batteries are something everyone needs. Small devices like remote controls will use up a lot of conventional batteries throughout a lifetime, so these batteries were something I really needed. These last long, and they retain charge for a good amount of time."
Loved the price and when received that there were actually smaller packages of four instead of a bulk pack. Better price than Sam's or Walmart at the time of this review.
These batteries work the same as all the big name brands with a cheaper cost and not having to drive to the store.
You never really realize how many batteries you go through until you get these. I feel so great knowing that I wont run out anytime soon! Especially great when you need an emergency battery change.
An excellent buy for the amount of batteries.
SO BAD DO NOT EVEN LAST TWO MONTHS IN A MOUSE....A MOUSE!!!!!That's what I call utter garbage. Would return if possible.
Dollar store Sunbeam batteries lasted longer than these crappy things. So disappointing!
Amazon rulesHaha
"So far I love these batteries. You can't beat the price and they seem to work just as well as name brand. I've used them in various toys, remotes, and household necessities with no issues whatsoever. I plan on ordering all my batteries from amazon going forward."
So far I'm impressed! Holding up very well. Great price. I will be buying other sizes when it time to order.
"Good price. Too early to say how they last, but if they do, great deal better than the name brands."
Good quality for a good price.
Great value
Hope they lasts as described.
"I bought these after reading the reviews. They came nicely packaged. No issues so far with the things we have been using them for (toys, remotes). Will update if we have any issues."
"I've only had these batteries for a few days....they seem great they work! The price is great compared to the dollar store. If my opinion changes, I will update"
Seems to be good batteries so far
So far so good on battery life and shipping program. Love that these come in an easy to access box with stress free packaging. I'm still measuring them against my name brands but do wish there was an offering in rechargeable.
"So far so good, will update rating when finished"
So far so good. These batteries seem to work well at a fraction of the price of name brands.
So far so good. Will update if anything changes.
So far so good....work as well as brand name batteries and cost much less
They work
Time will tell how well they perform. They are a little less expensive than Energizer and if they perform as well I'll re-order them.
Working good so far. Haven't had any of them to be leaking or dead yet bilingual haven't used them all either.
So far so good BUT the test of a good battery is how long they last so stand by for an update later.
So far so Good !
"so far so good, but a little early to tell if they will measure up to top brand for less money"
"So far so good, great value for batteries and they seem to be working just as well as the others!"
"So far so good, had issues with duracells leaking, not noticing any less performance and no leakers :)"
"Typically I buy ProCell batteries... but, I decided to give these a try based upon independent reviews. So for I have been pleased with their performance but it has been limited to use in remotes so far."
No issues thus far. I just started using them so I speak for their longevity.
Only time will tell if they work as good as their price. I'll update the review when I know more.
They work. So far so good.
"So far so good. Great value. Well packaged, nice clean design and arrived quickly."
So far so good. Haven't had long enough to say if they last long or not. Liked price and the amount in package.
"So far so good. The charge seems decent on these (I was afraid they wouldn't last long). I haven't had to replace any yet. For the price, I'm very happy."
So far so good...good value overall time will tell how long they will last but will update if they don't last as long as name brands
"I haven't calculated the life VS cost break-even, but these have worked well in all of my devices. I would order again just because of the bargain and convenience."
So far the batteries work as good as the more expensive name brands. I love all of the Amazon Basics stuff I've ordered so far!
So far these batteries have been good even on my little girl's toys. I was afraid of trying them because of the reviews they don't last long... but so far I like them and I'll be getting more when running low.
so far these batteries seem to do well.... they were a little more expensive than the memorex batteries but I wanted to try them.... so far so good
This is my first time purchasing Amazon batteries. I decided to give them a try as the set that came with my Fire TV lasted a long time. So far they are great. They last about the same amount of time as Duracel and Energizer branded batteries. I'm always leary of off brand batteries as I've had several bad experiences. These Amazon batteries are great. No leaks yet. Great buy!
I'm using three now and so far they're good. I love the flat sturdy box they came. Perfect for storing. Also a lot more batteries than I realized. :-)
I have been using these batteries for about a month now and the half I have used have performed very well. The Batteries I inserted into 3 items when they arrived are still working.So far I have found no bad batteries included in my order.Would recommend based on performance of the batteries I have used so far.
No problems so far.
So far these batteries are just as great as other brands I've had and the price can't be beat. I bought two packs of 48 count. I was serious.
"So far, so good.Good price. Good performance.....so far."
Got these for some LED motion lights. So fare working great.
"So far, so good, first time we bought these."
"So far, so good!"
"Just started using them. So far, so good."
"So far, so good."
"So far, so good. I haven't had them in a device long enough to report on actual battery life."
"so far, so good. Seem to work as well as any I've bought and I definitely like the price."
"So far, so good. These arrived quickly and are well packaged. They seem just as powerful as their name brand counterparts. Think these will do just fine."
"So far, so good. They all seem fully charged and last as expected."
So many batteries for reasonable price! So happy about it!
So many batteries for the price. Will take me years to use it all
Enough batteries to power my remote for a decade. I would have loved this many AAs for my Gameboy growing up.
Works great in my xbox controllers and wii controls!
So much more affordable than even big box stores and last just as long as name brand batteries. I will only buy batteries from Amazon from now on.
So nice having a huge pack of batteries in the house. I never run out. These work super great!
not long lasting move on pay more get more
so so
Good price for batteries except it seems like they don't last near as long as name brand
"these batteries are ok but do not seem to have much power over time compared to the copper top brand. bought them for game controllers, so the family seems go through them like water"
"I usually buy the 5.00 24 battery special at Harbor Freight, but they were not on sale when I needed some, so I decided to get theseBoth of the batteries are supposed to be Alkaline, so you would think they would both last about the same length of time NO SOI use these in a Personal Pedi Callused Skin grinder, so they get a good workoutAMAZON's batteries just don't last as long.... and it's a NOTICEABLE differenceI'm going back to Harbor Freight's Alkaline's"
My kids go thru a lot of batteries. These are good for the wii remote and other items that do not draw a huge power source but flash lights and the such seem to go thru them a lot faster.
"So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Uh-oh, make that DON'T last. I don't take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I'm not gonna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left. Ticks me off, royally!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase."
"Low price, high quality, fast delivery. Can't argue with anything in the AmazonBasics line in my experience so far."
These batteries are pretty good have a long life would recommend
"SOLID BATTERIES, GREAT PRICING"
Great price and the product quality has been superb. Buy again - yes!
I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.
"Sleek design. Comes with batteries needed. I've compared the number to another scale that same day hours later and it displayed the same number. I'd say it's very accurate. Clear display, thin black platform. Your typical scale. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion. I'd buy again and would recommend to a friend. Solid product."
This is a solid product from Amazon Basic. I will happily order these again and again.
"I'll give them two stars for the price, but you really do get what you pay for. These batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the Kirkland ones I got from Costco. Or, maybe it's just some of them that fail too soon. I put several new Amazon AA batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use. When a couple of those devices stopped working, I tested the batteries. In both cases, only one battery was actually dead, the other was fine. That seems weird, weird enough that I'll go back to Costco for my next battery purchase."
"I don't know if I just got a bad batch or not, but some of these batteries are partially discharged. I opened a pack of 4, put them in a device and it gave me a low battery indication. I swapped them out with 4 more from the same box and they worked."
"Several of the (new) batteries do not work. Very frustrating to replace a battery in an appliance and gave it not work and not know whether the problem is the appliance or the battery. Plus some things require several batteries and so it is hard to figure out which battery is not functional...I've experienced this with a couple devices (one wireless mouse and one kids toy) and trying different batteries resolves it, so I'm pretty confident the problem is the batteries."
"Came with only 12 of the 36 batteries in the box. Someone can't count. Two previous orders came with all 36, which warrants a 3 rating overall I suppose."
"Lots of batteries, but I am going through them pretty quickly. I will switch to a higher quality battery on my next order."
"These batteries are great for remotes, but I'm on the fence when it comes to a video game controller. Since I can't say how many actual hours of performance we are getting per use in the controller, I've just noticed that there are more frequent trips to the closet to replace them than usual. Although, it was over the summer and game time was higher than usual."
"Just opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a meter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read 1v DC some read 0v dc and some read 2. volts. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 volt As you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 volts and packages of AA as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well"
"These don't last long, wouldn't buy again. Spend the extra money get good batteries."
Very happy with their performance thus far for the price.
"Same quality as other Alkaline brand, not much to say, it is a standard alkaline battery with AMAZON brand on it."
"They are batteries at a good price that work. I did not do any sort of power level tests or anything, but they seem fine for general use."
"I haven't used this brand yet, so I can't rate the use, however for my needs, they are exactly what I was looking for, long life, expiration date, grouped by 4, perfect for long term storage,"
starting to really like some of the Amazon basic stuff - these seem to work well for around the house remotes and small draw items like that.
"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."
as good as any brand name battery for a much better price
"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt."
"Lasted less than half the time of a Duracell alkaline battery in the same conditions. (LED candles, on continuously)."
"Bought AmazonBasics for all the new toys my kids were getting for Christmas, all of which have had to be replaced in the past couple months. Life of this battery isn't great."
"So far so good!, I put dates on these batteries to check the life line when installed into batteries power items. I'll have future updates on this items. Stand by!"
working good.
"Got enough now for any possible hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and other disasters that take out the electricity. YOU can never have too many batteries, just in case."
Needed AA batteries. Best price!
"I have bought these Amazon batteries a few times. It is just so convenient. And you might as well just keep batteries stocked and by this big one. Especially around the holidays. There is nothing more painful than when you 8 year old gets something new and you have to search the house for some other device that contains AA batteries. Just buy these. And when you run out, order them again. Why stress yourself out over running to the store for AA batteries when your child is screaming and crying over their remote control car. These last a long time as far as I can tell. I have rarely replaced them so far."
"Quite pleased with the longevity. I have a digital camera that eats batteries like a fat kid eats chocolate cake. If I was attending a concert or a family event, I'd take at least one spare pair of batteries as a back-up, which eventually ends up costing a small fortune. Although I've not done any scientific tests, these seem to last twice as long as what I was using and the price is much cheaper. These will definitely be my new go to batteries."
Brand new batteries that are very affordable come in a nice cartoon box stack. Work as expected.
"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more."
These batteries work as well as any batteries I've purchased for the things I need batteries in. We have these shipped automatically using Subscribe and Save and I it is nice to ALWAYS have batteries on hand!
good stuff here
So many batteries and they last a decent amount of time. Such a better price than going to the store!
"Very nice packaging! Love the price and the nice convenient packaging makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!"
Conforms to the widely-accepted AA size.Fits where all my name-brand AA batteries fit.So far have incurred no damage to my home or pets from their use.
"Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapper, completely dead... thanks..."
Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.
work very well...super charge
Much better deal than you can get anywhere else
As promised. Super fast shipping.
Just what I wanted. Last long enough to consider it as my preferred AAA batteries.
These were a really good buy.
"Super happy with Amazon batteries. Great Price! Batteries work just as good as other big brands. You won't be disappointed. I sure love them, and would definately purchase more in the future!"
These batteries are lasting as long as the big name brands...super impressed and will buy again! At the rate we go through batteries (4 children age 7 and under with the corresponding battery operated toys) this is a great find.
Last forever! Super pleased!
"I cannot believe how inexpensive these are. We've been using rechargeables (which are about 2.50 each) because batteries are so expensive, but these work great and for so cheap! With a toddler who burns thru all our batteries with lightening speed I cannot begin to tell you how thrilled I am with these. Not sure how long they last but hey, you get what you pay for."
"I have quite buying batteries anywhere else. These are long-lasting, superior batteries at an excellent price. Why buy elsewhere when they are available at Amazon and I don't even have to go to the store to get them!"
"So far these batteries have outlasted the Duracell batteries they replaced in my Xbox remote, at a fraction of the cost!"
"can't beat the price, but i could sweat my energizers last a little longer. i'll shoot from the hip here: i think the dollars/output is better than energizers, but if battery life is the only real variable i might go with commercial battery brands. please note- this is not carefully measures, just first glance based on kids playing with toys..."
Nicely packaged and full of powerExcellent service. Batteries are freshly manufactured.
My son goes through batteries like water so these are the perfect solution
"I thought these might not last as long bc they weren't name brand, but they were surprisingly wonderful! I'll definitely buy again!"
"Got a prime membership and decided because I didn't have to pay for shipping this would be a good deal, cheaper then battery's in the store. Well these are equal if not bettter then the duracells. Would recommend to a friend."
"We go thru a lot of batteries, seems to be a very good battery at a great price. Would recommend!"
Talk about Power ! its Amazon ! no need.
bought for work use. techs go through batteries like crazy.
"I went through all 48 in less than 2 weeks. I can't lie and say they were awesome, when they were not."
"Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in a home weather station, regardless if warm or cold weather. Cheap Rayovac batteries work just fine and I will stick with buying those locally at Menards."
Worst batteries I've ever used. I used them in a sensor light. They only worked l l/2 months while my prior Energizer batteries had worked for 5 l/2 months. I can see why these batteries are so cheap. I definitely would NOT recommend them to anyone.
"Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. How hard can it be, right Batteries don't last. Every device I've used them in began to have quirky little malfunctions (remote buttons don't always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse randomly disconnects from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned."
"I tried using these on my mini mist diffuser, amazon basics batteries discharges easily within a week. This is terrible in comparison to energizer batteries which lasts at least 3 months."
"Ok, terrible life span."
Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.
Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast. We put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within 2 days. They were timed for 4 hours so it's not on for long. We used Energizer batteries last year and worked for the 20 days that were on display and didn't have to change any. But I guess for 24 for 100 you get what you pay for. Will not buy these again.
terrific
Good price and fast delivery. I tested four of the batteries and each measured 1.62 VDC.
Love my batteries !!!! Thank You
"As other reviewer commented, thank you, these batteries expiration date was 5+ years off when we purchased them. We've not had any problems with any of them. Many applications just do not do well with those rechargeable batteries, so these fit the bill nicely."
It sure is nice never running out of batteries!
You cannot get a better deal on batteries than this. I have found they last a long time and are just as good as any brand name.
Thank You!
great
"I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected."
Great battery awesome price.
"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."
"Great price and Amazon has become a reliable name in our household. You know when you get something that has the Amazon Basics logo on it it will not only work properly it will also last as long or even better than any competitor. Thank you once again Amazon!I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected."
"Great product at a great price! As usual, Amazon is amazing!!"
"I was so glad to see these batteries in large quantities on amazon!!! I am so tired of paying so much for them at local retailers for packages much smaller. I plan on buying them from here from now on and keeping all my battery operated candles and lights in full use! The only reason I did not give these a 5 star rating is that I haven't used them yet but I usually by generic brands from the locals so these are probably going to be a better quality.Our household really goes through these daily for remotes, candles, string lights whatever....you name it we need batteries for it. :)"
Thanks for your review
thanks
thanks for quality batteries. prolonged electronics life by a lot.
"Doesn't get easier than this. Good products shipped to my office free, in two days:)"
The AmazonBasics brand has some really nice products and the batteries definitely fall within that category. Inexpensive and they last long too. Its nice to be able to buy in bulk and not break the bank and always have plenty of spare batteries in the cabinet for kids toys/gadgets.
Great buy- batteries where at my front door step with in 2 days
"These batteries are great, not too costly, and just get the job done. I also like the packaging where the bacterias are stored. I would switch out the new battery with my old ones and put the old ones back in the slot of the packaging. It keeps them together. I'm not sure if there are places that recycle these type of batteries around, but if there were it would make buying these a total must."
"The batteries appear to be working great. I've been using two AA's in my Xbox One controller for over a month now. If you can get a sale on these like I did, buy, buy, buy!"
The batteries are good and I have enjoyed the use of them but why do you package 4 batterie at a time with plastic. It's a hassle to unwrap. I feel like they are prepackaged for a trip to mars
These batteries work just as well as name brand batteries while being substantially cheaper. These are also packaged well. The cardboard box is slim and holds its shape unlike a normal plastic battery box. The batteries are shrink-wrapped together so they stay nicely in place. I just take some from the end and leave the remaining batteries nicely in their package.
The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. We hve a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fans fly. A little disappointed.
"The batteries are the very worst I have ever used. I use a wireless mouse for work, and I've had to replace the battery every 2 weeks, instead of once a year like my old batteries. By the time you figure out how bad they are, you will be outside your return window. A fail for Amazon if you ask me, and makes me question whether I should keep shopping with them."
"The batteries had very short life. Long time fan of Amazon.com, first time buyer of Amazon brand batteries. Replaced batteries in a digital clock. After about 3 months (I bought the batteries in August, and now it's November), the batteries were dead. I have had this clock for years and never had any brand of batteries that lasted so short."
The batteries worked perfect for my traxxas rustler rc remote
So far so good. They work - they seem to last a decent amount of time and the price is right.
The batteries work just fine. We use them in our remotes and game controllers. Their life seems on par with big name brands.
The batteries work well.
I opened up this package fresh and put two AA batteries in my Xbox one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I'm not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I'm not sure what's going on here Amazon.
"ALWAYS buy my batteries from Amazon Basics. GREAT price, delivered fast and with everything I need them for now a days, it is essential to have a stash around!"
"The best batteries you can get for the price, i have been using it in my xbox controllers so far i am satisfied with the results.Update: my controller batteries just died after like one month of use, i was rarely using my controllers(playing games). So, don't expect longer life from thess batteries. Still i am sticking with my 5 star for the price i paid."
"Awesome value at an awesome price. I LOVE how 4 batteries are shrink wrapped at a time. This makes it so much easier to put in my car, flight bag, backpack, and any other place for the what-if moment. I'll be ordering the aaa pack soon..."
"The best deal on AA batteries you can find! They work great, and I'll definitely be buying more once I go through this large amount!"
"Really love these batteries. As everyone will tell you, this is the best deal on batteries you will find anywhere. Unlike other store brand batteries, these are actually good batteries that work, and yet they cost a fraction of what Duracell and Energizer batteries cost. I don't think I'll buy any other kind of battery again Amazon batteries from now on!"
"Long lasting, and a great price."
"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again."
Not a single one was a failure and not a single one leaked. Overall a good product.
The charge is really bad. I used them all up super quick because they don't last. Will not buy again.
Works and performs just as long as other name brands. Great price for the number of batteries int he pack. Would recommend.
solid AAA batteries that last na expected ammount of time. packaging easy and this is a seriously convenient option. Will always use this now as the price point and convenience make any other batteries a less economical choice.
The good quality I expect from Amazon.
"I've had great luck with these. Some brands don't take a charge, at ALL with my fairly sophisticated digital charger. SO many brands show up as fault. These don't."
The lights seem to work real well. I have not used them for long put they are plenty bright enough for the closet I'm using them in.
"The main thing is - they work. Reliable batteries are great- and that's what these are, they just keep going and going and going, etc. :-)"
"Never again will my Fallout 4 excursions be interrupted by cheap gas store batteries, nothing but cats and raider smashing from here on out, thanks Amazon!"
"The latest reviews of name brand batteries have gone downhill lately. It seems they leak, rust, don't last, etc.. Perhaps Amazon is licensing older battery technology, or their manufacturer is anyway. So what These work better than the name brands! These are the only batteries I will buy, except Lithium Smoke Detector batteries. Amazon Any plans for Lithium batteries"
The only batteries that I buy now! Price is great and they seem to hold up as good as their more expensive competition.
What a deal!!!
Always a good value and packaging makes them easy to store and easy to use
One of the batteries was dead right out of the package. The other three in the pack was fine.
The package was open and had no batteries....
Great product and just as good as others on the market. The packaging the batteries arrived in was very large and amazon could do better.
The performance on these batteries are pretty good- happy to be able to buy some cheaply and in bulk as we go through many AA batteries with all the toys for my two year old.
Great price for a commodity product
The price is good but they 'battery life' is much lower than other alkaline batteries we use. I get approx half the life from these batteries - compared to Walmart RayoVacs
"These batteries last a while and for the amount of batteries you're getting, the price is great!"
Great price!! Love the Amazon Basics line. No problems with quality.
"The price was good, but we had some trouble with them working in a flashlight. They didn't connect right, and we couldn't get it to work. The flashlight worked with other batteries, though."
They put out power. The price was good.
The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very long. For some items they don't work at all. It's like they just don't have a lot of power. I will not be getting these again.
A++++ Seller. The Product was excellent and exactly what i needed.
"The quality of Amazon AA battery is going down. Now just after a few weeks, even when it shows full power from battery power meter, the Amazon battery cannot be used in many appliances. (bluetooth keyboard, soap dispenser...)"
Those of us in World War II can all appreciate what was happening in the South Pacific while we were elseware. I was in the North Pacific at a secret U.S.-Russian site where we were planning a joint attack of Japan. We hear nothing about what was happening farther South. The book ansered our questions.
"I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I've used them in toys, remotes, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that's all the use I got out of them. I unsubscribed to this item. No thanks."
"The package provided good quality batteries in a size I need most often, without including other sizes of less usefulness. I also appreciated the packaging, which is more accessible than the common drugstore packages (which can be a challenge to open)."
"So far, the seem like very good batteries."
Appear to perform as well as top-brand batteries at a fraction of the price. The storage box they come in fits nicely in our utility drawer.
"I ordered the 100 pack of AAA AmazonBasics batteries for Christmas, dividing between my kids for the grandkids needs. The value versus the largest pack of ANY brand available at most retailers is great. The reviews I read prior to purchasing were good, and so far, we are very pleased"
"The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon's rechargeable pack. Doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually recharge. Spend the money on duracell or energizer. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging"
"Worst batteries I have ever purchased - bought them for Christmas items like battery operated lights and candles but they didn't last even a week with limited usage. Spend a little more and get more for your and time, it'll save you in the long run!"
"There was a deal somewhere where I could get 48 AA batteries, I wish I could get that deal for these batteries."
"and then there's cheap. yeah cheap batteries alright but also cheap performance. these last half the time the C's house brand batteries, (in the same unit) for only just a little less money. disappointed as I was hoping Amazon might try to only put their name brand on half way decent stuff.there's a reason they send you a whole big box of 'em, ..... you'll go through 'em fast."
These alkaline batteries appear to be of good quality and provide excellent power output to my devices. Only time will tell if they provide long life in storage without leaiagel
"Batteries! These Amazon Basics AAAs actually have surprisingly good battery life. I hate that devices that use AAAs still exist, but I'm glad I can get a bunch of them from Amazon on the cheap."
"These are a great price compared to buying brand name batteries at the store. I will definitely have enough AAA batteries to last a lifetime now haha. They have been working well since I got them, and I'll try to give an update on when they start to run out of power. My only complaint is that I wish they didn't package the batteries in the plastic film. I feel like the box was sturdy compact enough as is without the need for extra trash waste."
"These are a great price. I'm not sure they last as long as a name brand battery, but they get the job done."
"I bought these thinking, Great I can save some money!...... Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)...... Seriously, these batteries last me probably 2 hours when using them a lot...... Not kidding.....I will not repurchase these......."
"For the money, these are an excellent buy and work very well."
"These are at the same price as generic cheap batteries, if not less expensive, and they last just as long as quality Duracell or Energizer, if not longer. I've stocked up on every type of battery with Amazon Basics."
"These pants have become my everything in the cold pants. I bike, I run and I ski in them. I stay warm, I stay dry and the best thing of all I can move with no restrictions. I'm ordering another pair."
I will never buy expensive overpriced name brand batteries again. THESE ARE AWESOME.
"These are batteries, they came packed together. I put them in remotes when the old batteries die and these make the remotes work again. 5 stars."
"I am a member of a wilderness search and rescue team and always need to keep backup batteries for flash lights, gps, and headlamps. These batteries are a great price and get the job done. They come sealed together which make them easy to toss into a back and ensure I have them when needed and aren't rolling around. I will be buying more in the future."
These are batteries. They power battery-operated electronics. The end.
I literally can't think of anything else you would say about batteries
But these every time
These are cheap and seem to last as long as any other battery I've tried. I'm seriously impressed with the amount of batteries I get. For the same price I could get 16 of my usual brand. This will be my go-to from now on.
Well I no longer need to ask if we have any batteries or move them from one device to another. These are cheap and they work as good as the name brands. I am very happy and everything in my home has a fresh battery. These are a great alternative to the normal Buy 4 for 20 packages in your local drug store. I wont buy another of those over priced packages again.
"These are decent but I find they last about 20 less than Duracell batteries, but considering the cost difference they are actually worth it."
"These are fine, for the price but not as Duracell"
"these are good batteries at a good price. with small kids in the house and approximately 9000 toys and remotes that need batteries, we use them often."
"These are good batteries, but they don't seem to last as many charges as some other brands I have used. They start to last a shorter time between charges. They were much less expensive than the other batteries so it probably all evens out."
Best place to buy batteries for a great price
These are great batteries at a great price. Plain and simple. Don't be a dummy. Just buy them because you know you need a case of extra batteries.
"These are great batteries for around the house and I don't notice any runtime difference between them and the other major brands. The price is awesome, and they work as expected. Nothing else to say about AA's really :)"
"These are great batteries to keep on hand around the house. There's nothing really fancy about them. They're basic, they work, and the mulit-packs are very affordable (much more so than the ones I usually buy). They seem to work just as effectively, but they were less expensive AND saved me a trip to the store. It's a win-win!"
"These are great batteries without paying the premium for name brands. Our kids go through batteries like their potato chips, so its nice to get a good product at a reasonable price."
"These are great batteries, at a great deal. They last a long time and we are very happy with the purchase. We did however have some that are DOA, I called Amazon and they took care of us, AWESOME customer service, as always."
These are great batteries. I'm not seeing any difference between these and the Duracell Pro Cell that are my standard choice. Good Value.
"These are great for the price! They do tend to die slightly faster than other batteries, but overall they are great for what you pay. I would recommend these to anyone looking for basic batteries. The come in a plastic wrap which is easy to open. The same can't be said about some battery brands."
Why pay out your nose for Duracell These are great!
a no brainer. these are great.
These are great. We go through AA batts like crazy in our house. Lasted just as long as the name brands but cost less. I will be purchasing again.
"These batteries are very long lasting and well-priced! I have been using them on voice recorders and noise cancelling headphones, and compared to other Alcaline and Ni-MH batteries, these are holding up pretty well!They also come with a cool packaging!"
"These are just AA batteries and I really can't get excited about them. But here's the reason I'm giving them 5 stars. I had typically been buying Kirkland brand AA batteries at Costco. The Kirkland batteries come loose in this large cardboard packaging with a plastic tray thing to hold the batteries. The packaging of these batteries, wrapped in 4 packs in a little cardboard container, is so much nicer for storage than the Kirkland batteries. The packaging alone compared to what I've been dealing with makes this a 5 star product in my mind."
These are just as good as the other name brands out there. I have been using them for awhile and so far none of my electronics need new batteries yet. Especially my wii controllers. Thank you Amazon! I am tired of wasting a lot of money on batteries!
"Now I have many batteries. No need to press Charges, officer. They know not, WATT they do.Is good batteries."
"This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference."
work but short life
These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.
"Arrived on time, battery doesn't last very long though even when fully charged, so that's my only concern."
These are perfectly good batteries that are affordable. I love having them on hand in bulk for those random times when I need a battery and do not want to go to the store.
These are really good batteries. We have gotten these a few times now and haven't had any issues with them at all. They work well in everything we have tried them in. They seem to hold up just as long as other brands of batteries do. These are a good buy. would definitely recommend these batteries to other people.
These are so a good value! I use these all around the house and they last a long time. I will never buy batteries at a regular store again!
These are solid batteries and last as long as the name brands. These are the only batteries I buy now.
These are batteries. They are afforadable and work like batteries should. Buy these batteries.
So far I love it very good price and all the batteries are fully charged :) (I checked!) I also love the package that it was in. I'm using it as storage for these batteries right now very useful. I guess all I'm saying everything that comes with this are useful :)
"These are the best bargin high performance batteries that I have found. At this price, why purchase name brand disposable batteries"
These are the only batteries I use. The price is right and they work for a long time in the devices we use them in. I will keep buying them when I run out of batteries.
Bought these batteries because of the 4 - 5 star ratings from verified purchases.....what These are the worst batteries I've ever used! 1 week of these batteries 1 month or more of brand name batteries.
They are batteries. They hold a charge and give that charge without malice and unconditionally. Unlike my ex wife.
"These are very good batteries at a good price. That aside, I contacted Amazon about my last set purchased, having seven batteries missing and the customer service promptly sent me a set to replace them quite quickly.It's impossible to have things go perfectly every time, and a lot can be realized by how a company handles things when problems surface. This couldn't have been handled any better."
"These batteries are a great bargain. I use trail cameras to monitor my property, and they chew up AA batteries 8 at a time. These seem to last as long as any major brand I have used in the past, but at a fraction of the cost."
"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."
"These batteries are a great price and they hold up every bit as well as the more expensive varieties I,'ve bought in the past."
"These batteries are a great value. They're very dependable. I have purchased several different brands of batteries and I would say these are by far my favorite for several reasons. Of course the price is 1, dependability is 2 and I can get them in two days with Amazon Prime. I would recommend them over any other brand I have used."
"These batteries are alot better than i thought they would be. I bought them thinking they would burn out quick, WRONG!!!!!! They have lasted longer than the batteries i was using before i bought these. I use them quite a bit in xbox controller and my kids remote control cars. Very good batteries and good quality for the price. I was very suprised!!!"
"These batteries are AMAZing. Honestly though, they last super long, and work just like a duracell. I have used the Amazon batteries for a few years, and I have been fully converted to using their brand on all my devices that use regular batteries. You will not be let down by the longevity and quality of these batteries. Plus, this is an incredibly good deal."
"These batteries are better than name brand. When used in a device that has consistent, and equal, daily use, these batteries lasted 2 days longer than the bunny and the copper top."
These batteries are cheap and last fairly long. We go through so many in our house with all the toys!
"I keep a good stock of batteries in my house. We have lots of flashlights and toys that require them. These are nicely affordable and I compare them to Energizer batteries, easily. (Don't look at 2nd pic if you're OCD )"
"These batteries are good, last long, but are temperamental. My electric trash can opens on a motion sensor. It worked great with the batteries for about a month, but then the trash can couldn't draw enough power in order to raise the lid. Then another week rolls by and the trash can works fine. I don't know if its the batteries or the trash can, but Im assuming its the batteries. Other than that, they work fine in everything else."
These batteries are great and last very long I would definitely recommend them to a friend or family over the Duracell brand better pricing
"These batteries are great, I used Duracell before for my remotes etc, but i am impressed with these, I am getting much longer life from them. I am updating this review, this will be the only battery I use, they last a long time, and are a good price!"
These batteries are great. They last a long time just like the more expensive ones. I use a lot of batteries so this was just what I needed.
These batteries are great. They last forever and are much cheaper than the name brands. Will continue to buy.
"These batteries are great. We love to have extra batteries especially around the holidays when it seems like every toy needs them. You can't beat the price and I think that these are just as great as the big brand names or at least I have not noticed a difference. We use them in everything from toys, to the TV remote, to flashlights etc. They come in a nice little cardboard box which is great to keep them all together for storage. Having loose batteries rolling around the junk drawer is never fun and they seem to get lost that way. I will buy these again for sure they are totally worth it."
Very trustworthy and reliable performance. Only batteries I will buy for their excellent endurance and great price
"These batteries are not very good. I bought them for the electric candles and after they were used 2 for 4 hours, the batteries were dead. My candles with everready are still burning after months."
"These batteries are okay they don't seem to last as long as brand name batteries, but you can't beat the price for these."
"The batteries suck. I have them in my mouse and I have to replace them every week. My Duracell's would last a month. I feel like they are only 1/2 charged, I put new ones in my flash for my high quality camera, and the flash was really slow and dim. Pretty crappy for new batteries. I am not pleased"
These batteries are terrible. All of my clocks (bought in this same order) need new batteries already because they are all dying. I now have to buy all Energizer batteries. :-(
"I decided I would try to see how long Amazons batteries would last. Well, I placed a AA battery into an LED candle 14 weeks ago and have not turned it off and it is still running. It seemed before I was replacing batteries left and right. These batteries are the BEST and I have told all my neighbors as well. I will NEVER trust any of my electronics, etc to any other batteries except AMAZON.Chatty0371 Port Orange FL"
There is no place to contact seller THESE batteries are the worst ! The last two days to a week. I would like a refund!
"These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I've replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste."
"These batteries are used for gaming and last exceptionally long. During heavy gaming use with three people playing games daily, it's not uncommon for us to get 6 months out of this pack."
"These batteries are as good as brand batteries. Actually better. Last a lot longer than brand, great purchase."
These batteries come very low charged. I took new batteries and put them in a computer mouse. Next day there was a Mouse Battery is very Low. Its not the first time.
"These batteries contain electrons and the electrons make stuff work. I don't know how, exactly, because I have a liberal arts degree, but, even though I don't know how they work, they still do."
These batteries do not last long.
"These batteries do what batteries need to do. I'm writing a review b/c this was an Alexa deal, which she told me was 5, and was charged 8."
I bought these for my cameras. They don't last any time at all. I won't buy these again.
These batteries don't last very long at all. Save your money. I don't recommend
These batteries have a short life compared to other alkaline batteries that we use. They are definitely basic batteries. I will not order these again.
These batteries were great quality and have worked as well or better than other batteries we have purchased.
These batteries have been working great for us so far. Excellent for all of todays modern Christmas and Birthday Presents.
"I use AmazonBasics batteries all the time, both the AA and AAA. I like them a lot and they last as long as any other batteries. I change the smoke detector twice a year to be safe but batteries in my clocks last a year before needing replacement. I'll continue using AmazonBasics because in addition to working they are a little more cost effective. Another great job Amazon.com!"
These batteries have worked well for us. We used rechargeable before this and they never worked as well as these. I would purchase again.
These batteries las forever and are at a great price compared to others. I use them in everything and never had a problem.
These batteries last about 25 of a stander energizer! Dont be suckered in by the price..... WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!
These batteries have been performing wonderfully in my clocks and other small appliances. The price is right with Subscribe and Save and I can't beat the quality or price elsewhere. They come nicely packed and shrink wrapped in four packs making them easy to carry. I will definitely continue to purchase.
These batteries last long and work great. I love buying in large quantities so when I am in need of replacing batteries in any of my electronics I don't have to worry about not having any.
These Batteries last longer than other leading brands. Will always order these from now.
"Please be aware that these batteries leak! I put these in a few electric candles and alarm clocks in our house, after a few days the bottom of the candles and clocks were coated with battery acid. No other battery brands have done this in our house before. I cannot tell you if they last long or not, got rid of them immediately."
"Great price, and shipped safely and Amazon was efficient with the packaging. I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for AA batteries, but these happen to work quite well."
These batteries provide power at a cheaper cost than most. Use these mainly for my Xbox controller because it eats batteries
These batteries seem to be really good they hold up just as long as nine brand we use them in our two way radios and our headlamps
"These batteries seem to work great and last plenty long enough for my use cases (remotes, computer mouse, flashlights, etc.)."
These batteries were a great purchase and I am very happy to have found the amazon brand in something that I use so frequently. I thought the price was fantastic for a package of twenty batteries. I use AAA batteries for a lot of things around my house so I like to order a substantial supply of them when I get new batteries. I couldn't have been more pleased when I discovered that Amazon has their own brand of batteries. I have never been disappointed with anything to do with Amazon and I am absolutely sure these batteries will meet all my expectations. When I received them I immediately put them into a clock that needed them. I also put them into my milk frother and a few other devices. The clock is keeping perfect time and the other devices are working at full capacity. These will be used in my remote controls and any other thing that requires this size battery. I will be ordering them in other sizes too. This is the perfect situation. I have found a great resource to purchase my batteries and have them in two days delivered straight to my door. These are a great buy and I recommend them to anyone needing batteries.
These batteries work better than the high dollar kind. I love them and will never buy another brand. They last a long time and have no trouble powering a battery draining device.
These batteries work great! I didn't have any problem using them in my battery powered candles this Christmas season. They lasted a long time.
These batteries work great. I would say comparable to top brands. We've used some for approximately one month and they are still going strong.We are currently using them in our game controllers and a clock...Will update as needed
"These batteries seem to last as long an Energizer. If you are a big battery user, these batteries work just fine for less."
"These batteries work just fine. I don't see a need for writing some big long review about batteries. All we care about is do they work, are they strong Absolutely and I will buy them again"
These battery arrive in a nice packaging. Super easy to open and store. The battery itself is great! definitely would purchase again!
These came with touch lights and they have been used for 7 days. The lights are already so dimmed and the batteries need replacing soon.
"...not even in a mouse, where I've already had to replace the batteries in less than three months, where premium brand batteries last the best part of a year or more.I thought these would be a bargain given the price. But the life is so short there is no benefit or savings. I won't buy these again."
These don't seem to last very long at all. I used them on my light in chicken coop. I replace once a week and only used it 2 or three times each week. Very dissapointed in this purchase. I usually buy our batteries from Costco.
These have been the worse batteries. I've bought these before and didn't have a problem but this batch doesn't even last a month.
"These have worked great in all of our flashlights, remotes, and all my kid's game controllers and toys. They last just as long if not longer than the much more expensive name brands."
I used to by the cheap chinese batteries from HF. Now that I've discovered AmazonBasics I'm now converted. These last much longer and are the best bang for your buck. I will certainly buy more when these run out!
These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries.
These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..
These seem to be normal AAA batteries. can't comment yet on life expectancy but for the price they could stand to be near the bottom performance and still be an okay value.
These seem to work just as good as any other AA battery but for SO MUCH CHEAPER. Seems like every battery operated device in our house takes AAs. I buy these as well as the Amazon rechargeable ones and they all work great. No regrets with this purchase.
"We use a lot of AA batteries with a number of wireless devices. For years, we have been I guess habitually dependent on Rayovac Alkaline AA Batteries 36-Pack. They have been as good as any other batteries we used and the price was unequalled, that is, until we began to look on Amazon.com. We then decided to try others, until we got a box of Duracell Procell AA 144 Batteries PC1500. They seemed to consistently last longer than the others. They were also usually 6 cents cheaper per battery. Undoubtedly, this was spelling: B-A-R-G-A-I-N! Actually, we remained with these, not even looking at alternatives until we kind of tripped over these AmazonBasics. Hands-down, these have been our best battery purchases. They are good, and originally were the cheapest yet! We don't even look for other bargains. I don't think it's worth the time or effort."
These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as I thought they would. For the little bit more I would get the Duracell or Enegizer ones.
"For the many devices that use batteries in our house, these were great, low-priced option. Will incrementally switch high-use devices to rechargeables for even greater savings."
"These were so cheap, but they work just as well as name brand batteries. Come in a cardboard box which is so much easier for storage than those cardboard and plastic things"
These work as well or better as Duracell.
"These batteries seem to perform as well as the name brands, and they cost less. In addition, they come in a nice box instead of being encased is plastic bubbles which take up a lot more room and make accessing the batteries much more difficult."
"We normally like to use rechargeable batteries but we have a few items that say not to use them so we bought these to use in those items. These batteries seem to work well so far everything is going well with them. They seem to be lasting okay, we did have a couple that seemed to run down quickly, we are chalking that up to the fact that my son left the device they were in on for an extended amount of time.We will continue to use the rest of the batteries and see how the rest of them perform. I will post an update if we find we have anymore that rundown quickly."
These batteries are exactly what you would expect. I have not had any issues with them not lasting long. I would recommend these to anyone looking to purchase batteries.
"Wow....the big A even has branded batteries at a discount compared to the copper tops. These work great, bought some double A's a while back which were great too."
"I think my kids eat these or share them with friends because I fly through them. These work great, sure they aren't a top lithium brand or something but for most applications this is exactly what you need and in a quantity that works and ensures you have them on hand when you need them."
These work just as well as namebrand alkaline batteries. I will buy them again
"These work pretty well, we used them for long term use in our Christmas candles for the whole month of December and they lasted the whole month."
These work really well and came in a very nice cardboard package. The organization of the cardboard package was much nicer than many of the plastic and cardboard packages batteries come in from the store. It was much easier to keep them all in the box (similar to a colored pencil box) than to try to shove them back in a half falling apart plastic package. They seem to work just as well as any storebrand batteries. I would definitely recommend these.
"While these surely don't last as long as big brand batteries, they are a good substitute when your kids have 5000 toys that required 3-8 batteries a piece! They do the job and power those things up just as any other battery brand would."
"They are batteries and at a good price, what else can I say"
"For the first time, a product that had packaging that was designed for the product and the product made it to me in one piece. as for the batteries, well, they are batteries and power my items just fine."
they are batteries and they make my battery powered stuff work so im not sure how this could get a low rating. for the price well worth it. that said they don't seem to last quite as long as other name brands.
Charged batteries at a low price.
They are batteries. Appear to be similar to the name brand batteries. Do not know if equal in performance or not and really don't care as the price is very inexpensive.
"They are batteries. They are cheap. They work. That is all, goodnight."
They are batteries. They work.
they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long.
These batteries last as long if not longer than other top name brands. This is the only way I buy batteries now. They are conveniently delivered to my door at an excellent price.
"These have been a much improved highly accepted battery replacement for the last order of Orange boxed Pro-Cells we received.Duracells were so short lived, it was necessary to get them out of service due to unstable charge, and even seals leaking and ruining devices.Amazon Basics items have been a way to save money consistently, and get quality that some manufacturers are skimping on.These have been no exception.They are dated: 2026, and I have no doubt they are a great buy.As of now these are powering many devices, and none have shown any questionable service."
"They are good batteries for the price but I find I have to change the batteries in my kid's toys more often than I did with duracell. Because of the price I would still buy them again, but if it's something you don't want to be swapping the batteries on all the time, I would go for a different battery."
For the price and the quantity you can't beat these. They are great batteries too. Last a long time
They work well so far no complaints. They are great little batteries and would buy again.
"Has power of Energizer Max, price of Amazon basic. Great for all the kids toys and remotes."
They are just what i was expecting My vote is more items should be designed for AA use.. Most AAA connection posts on wireless mice are insufficent for long term use. You guys know what I mean. You dont have to monkey around with a AA mouse.
"They are OK but not nearly as good as other batteries. They die far more quickly than other name brands. For example, I've changed the battery on my mouse three four times in just a few months already verses prior Durecell batteries that I changed maybe once a year. Several other things such as wireless Apple keyboard, remotes, etc., similar results, e.g., batteries wore out in a third or fourth of the time of Durecell. I won't buy them again. Discount not worth it. Result of purchase has been net negative."
They are okay. I thought by the reviews they would last longer but I'm only getting a little life out of them.
"Yup, batteries cheap. They are packaged like a PITA though and you ahve to rip these outa shrink wrap. Good for commercial resale in a store, since they are then packaged into smaller units for resale, for home use when you what to just dump them into a box and be done for the kids to grab like Halloween candy for all their gear - not easy to do that with. But to of batteries its still a good deal.. just expect some work opening them all up to dump them out."
"but I am not convinced that they last as long as Energizers. But, still, the price makes them well worth it."
Have batteries for a long time...they are pretty good...using them with cat coin box..nice...
"There isn't much I can say about these batteries. They are stand AA batteries that offer amazing performance at an amazing price! At 0.34 (normally 0.43) cents a battery, not only are they comparable to 1 batteries (Usually 0.25-0.50 cents a battery), but they are much more heavyweight and they last a lot longer! Between the 4 of us, especially our 2 kids, we fly through batteries like water and when we find a discount brand we like, we hold on to them tightly! I will be purchasing more AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries especially with the Holidays coming. They are inexpensive, high quality and worth every penny!"
"Great for the price, the have lasted as long as name brands. I will purchase more in the future."
"They arrived on time, as described, and have been powering the PIR lights I ordered for a few weeks now with out needing to be changed. I have no reason to complain."
"They came super quickly in the mail, they were very inexpensive compared to Duracell or energizer i would have bought at target and they are long lasting and work great!!!"
"They certainly do the job. They might not last quite as long as the name brands, but for the price difference, I think it all works out in the long run. They work for my needs."
"Their regular batteries, what else can I say about 'em."
"Not only are these the least expensive AA batteries I could find, they come shrink-wrapped in little 4-packs so it's obvious no matter what which ones are brand new and you can scatter them about the house like the battery fairy so there's always a fresh pack nearby."
"These suck! I may as well bought dollar tree batteries! We put them in three wreaths for Christmas lights that turn on for 4 hrs at night then turn themselves off with a timer and they burned out in three days, that's 12 HRS! Don't recommend...."
"I thought I was getting a deal when I saw these batteries. Unfortunately, they died after two weeks. I do not recommend buying this brand."
"Worst performance in AA alkaline batteries we have ever seen. We bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser pointers, and other applications. We are going back to name-brand AA batteries. This is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time."
they do not last like other batteries. i use in candles with timers... i get maybe 2 weeks out of them... 50+ hours.... i use to get months out of my duracell....
"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing."
"The fact that I have Amazon prime receive my orders in 2 days plays a major part in my decision to purchase these batteries. Which I prefer to order them instead of driving 30 min. to the store and waiting in line to pay. They work okay. I used them in a digital camera and they lasted a good 8 hrs of use. Of course I powered off my camera when not in use. But they lasted about the same timeframe as Duracell in my opinion. I have also used them in television remotes and I have had the same batteries in there for about a month now and they still work great. So overall, in my opinion, these batteries are a good purchase."
"I find myself wishing these had more capacity, but I'm also using these exclusively for a camera flash, so the nature of the beast is: high drain, changing out batteries often. They do the job, but don't expect energizer lifespan out of these guys."
I'm always satisfied with these batteries
"Great, long lasting batteries. I got them for my game camera, and after two months of use, they're still going strong on the first set."
"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months."
"They don't last. USed in electronics (like computer mice, computer keyboards) Energizer or Duracell last easily 3x longer. Not worth the savings. If its going in some kids game or infrequent use (where the battery would be dead later anyways) ok."
They don't seem to last that long as the ones you can get off the store. I bought them because I thought they were cheaper but Sam's club sells them cheaper and they last much longer.Update 1/10/2017Not only do they not last long but the new batteries that say are good till 11/2018 are pretty much dead without any use.Highly disappointed in amazon for this.
It's a great price but the batteries do not last long at all!
"The tips seem to be polished so much that they do not make good contact. I had a problem where these batteries wouldn't work at all, but the duracell ones that I took out would. After swapping back and forth a few times, I took them to my battery tester and found that I had to twist them around to get them to register. So I took my batteries to some sand paper to get the contact point to work."
They don't really last that long.. I had them in my mouse I blew through them really quickly. I wouldn't buy them again.
I've used Amazon batteries for many years and have never had a leaker. I can't say that about US made batteries...
"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well"
"Mine don't appear to have a charge. I bought them for a plant watering system that takes AAA batteries. I tried three sets of these AAA batteries in the plant watering system, which works fine currently with rechargeable batteries. They alkaline performance batteries don't work.I was hoping to get longer battery life from these performance batteries but they don't work at all."
They don't work. Still to regular brands.
"Hey, they're batteries, have an expiration date, fit as expected. I assume they last just as much as the high dollar batteries."
What can I say They work! )
These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.
"Bought these for a couple of baby toys, and so far, they have worked great. They are much cheaper compared to other popular brands!"
I bought these last year and they're still working!
"I tried these thinking they were much less expensive than the brand name batteries and they would likely last a similar amount of time. I was wrong. I primarily use these in remote controls. While I don't have specific test results, the Duracell batteries would last well over a year in my Dish Remote. I purchased these in February and have already replaced the batteries twice. Perhaps I ended up with a bad batch, but I won't be trying these again."
"The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkalines. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed. I used them, among others, for a wall clock and remote controller. Their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marketed and sold by Walgreen's for example. Take this into consideration before you buy them."
What a great deal! They last as long as any other 'name brand' batteries!
They last as long as any others. Why pay more
I only use Amazon basics batteries now. They last as long as name brands at a much better price.
Love these batteries. I keep them stocked in the cabinet. Two teenagers go through batteries lije there's no tomorrow. Glad I can save money with Amazon Basics. They last just as long as the name brand batteries. I keep the AAA and AA on hand at all times. Thanks Amazon...you make my life easier in so many ways!!
Cheap batteries. They last like cheap batteries.
Good batteries...
We tried these batteries out but they're trash. They lasted only 2-3 weeks in our tivo remotes which is amazing as we don't watch that much tv.
"bought these for remote control vehicle, they lasted pretty long, several hours , so they did the job"
They lasted really little.. (some of them) I use all batteries for same led lamps and 2 out of 4 Drained the Battery Quickly.
These batteries leak. What more is there to say They are the worst. Do not buy these.
"DO NOT BUY THEM.I got them because it said they were anti leakage. Well guess what.they leaked!!, completely destroyed my keyboard and I cant even open it up to get the batteries out. A waste of money and will also cost me a whooping 100 for a new keyboard and I cant use my desktop until I get a new keyboard."
They do what I need batteries to do.
I put them in my electronic devices and they started working. I guess I'm pretty happy about that.
AA Batteriers....they power stuff i want to use pretty good
They provide a good level of power and fit in battery compartments that are designed for AAA batteries. What more can you ask for.
They provide me with electricity. Let there be light. Seem to be lasting too so I have that going for me.
"These are okay. I use them mostly in my Xbox controller, they runout pretty quick. They are fine but I am looking into getting a rechargeable battery pack for it because I hate having my controller die mid game."
"They seem like a good value, thus far. If they last as long as expected, 5 stars may be in order."
They seem like quality batteries. I have used them in multiple devices and don't see any difference between them and name brand.
They seem to be lasting but only time with tell the quality of them. I wouldn't expect them to be bargain basement batteries. Probably somewhere between Rayovac and Duracell.
I've only used four so far so can't give five stars yet. They seem to be working fine but I'm not going to test one to destruction so it will be a feel I get over time.
So far so good.
"Just a bunch of batteries, they seem to work well and have a good lifespan. I use them in my wireless 360 controllers. None of them were damaged when they shipped. I'm sure I'll buy these again when I run out, but that will probably take a while."
"They seem to work well. I've only used three of the pack thus far, but that item is still going strong."
I buy these for my vibrator. They work just as well as the name brands but half the price. They definitely do as expected
I see too many people complaining that they don't have as much charge as they want them to but really The price is great! They help a lot when you have a 3 year old who constantly gets new toys that need batteries. These are the only batteries I buy now. I love them.
"They're batteries and they come charged and ready to go, there is not much of a review you can write about batteries. They power my daughter's choo choo train set, so I'm content."
"Between our toddler's toys and various household gadgetsremotes etc, we needed a lot of batteries! These battery value packs from Amazon are awesome! We've found that the Amazon basics batteries last almost as long as the big name brand ones do. They are a lot cheaper though and I don't see myself buying expensive name brand batteries anytime soon."
"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning."
as advertised
good Batteries
On par with most other name brands in length of time use
Perfect and a good price. No more running to the hardware store for batteries. So much easier.
Put them in the grand kids toys and they worked.
really they are batteries
Solid batteries. Never been disappointed by amazon batteries before
These batteries seem to work just as good as other leading brands and at a cheaper price point! I haven't had any leaks in anything I have used them in so far.
They are pretty much your typical AAs for a very cheap price.
they work
they work - what more can I say LOL
They work.
What can I say about a battery
work great. Well packaged.
Good qualifty...and price.
"Hey, they work and priced great. Nice to have plenty on hand for the million things that take double A. Nicely packaged in box, but then the plastic wrap around them is a bit much."
"bought these for wireless keyboards and mice, they work and seem to have a pretty long life."
"They work and they're cheap, but Duracell lasts longer."
They're batteries. They work as they should. They should last 5 years: hopefully so.
"These work as well, if not better, than other more expensive batteries I've purchased in the past. They last as long. They seem to have the same power as in pocket flashlights shine as bright, and I can have them delivered right to my door for less than I'd pay at the store. Can't beat that. I will continue to buy these and the other size Amazon Basic Batteries"
"For some reason I thought I was buying rechargeable ones as these showed up in the results when I typed in rechargeable AAA batteries in the search box. Must not have paid too much attention, oh well. They work as well as the so called high end long lasting brands and I'm still glad that I have them, as it's nice to have extras on hand."
No more going to the store for batteries for me. So far they have been working fine.
"I was intending to buy rechargeables, but bought these by mistake. They work fine though."
Works like any other brand and a whole lot cheaper.
They work fine. Not the longest lasting battery but dollar for dollar they do just fine
They work fine. Why would anyone buy half the quantity for more than 2X the price at some box store
"I dont know what I could possibly say that over 6,000 other reviewers have not already said.. so I won't even go into details. I needed more AAA batteries, and I am a amazon-junkie so I ordered their batteries. Popped three into a flashlight that needed batteries.. and I had light! They work.. Now how they will hold up over time, I do not know yet.. but they work for now and worked in my flashlight so I am happy with them!"
Works as well if not better than other batteries. Will order again.
They work good!
"See what I did with that title up there Anyways, my wife likes using AA batteries as if for each one we use and throw away a puppy is adopted from the local animal shelter. And since we've moved on from regular candles to LED ones in our home, we need more AAs than ever. Nowhere will you find a better price! My dad once told me that all batteries are made the same, its just the label that's different, just like antifreeze. I still don't know if that is true, but these batteries last just as long as anything else we've tried. Also, if you have something against batteries colored black or silver, you just hit the jackpot."
AmazonBasics AAA rock
"So far, they work great and have lasted a few days in my trail cameras, and I like the price."
"Seem to be working very strong in my flashlights!!! They last almost as long as the expensive batteries that i have been using. and these r one third the cost!!! I am highly impressed with these, This is the only brand of batteries i will be buying from here on out!!! I have only tested the AA and the AAA so far."
"They work great, have been lasting longer than the Dollar Tree ones I got for my mouse (which is what I primarily need them for)."
They make my stuff work I love it when my stuff works. They seem to last as long if not longer than name brand batteries. I will never buy batteries at the grocery store again!!
"Nothing wrong with these batteries. They seem to work just as good as the named brand ones I buy at the store and they defiantly work better than the cheap-o ones. I am currently using some in a battery operated lanterns, a flash light, and one of my youngest daughters toy. I have not experienced any problems with these.I really like that I can order good quality batteries at a good price and have them delivered to my door. Honestly we could always use more batteries at our house."
They're batteries. Not a whole lot to say about them other than they work.
They work great.and the price is really great!
They work great. Best value on batteries.
You can't beat the price. They work just as good as name brand. It's even cheaper in the subscribe memberships. Try them
they work just as I needed them to
"These work GREAT and are much more affordable! This pack will last about 2 months but that's because nobody else buys batteries in my house. They all take mine which had become too expensive of a habit for me. They work just as well (if not better!) than the brand I used to buy. I'll be buying other sizes of these to have on hand, especially since they don't break my (limited) wallet!"
These batteries perform just as efficiently and effectively as their more expensive name brand counter parts.
They are batteries and they work. I don't think they last as long as some of the more expensive batteries but really its hard to tell.
"I've been using the Amazon Basics batteries for some time. I get them on subscribe and save.These are not meant to be heavy duty or super long life. They last reasonably long for my purposes and the price is extremely fair. These are so inexpensive that I don't expect them to last as long as the name brands and therefore I don't worry about it. I feel they do a very good job for the way I use them (mouse, keyboard, mini flashlight, small radio, etc.) and will continue to order the Amazon Basics in both the AA and the AAA sizes."
"There working good in my xbox one controller, have not done extreme test to see how long they last, (they last long enough) for the price I can already tell there a better buy than any name brand."
"They work really well, they do not drain quickly so that is a plus since I need them for my xbox controller."
"They work we... Maybe don't last as long as the high dollar batteries, but the price makes up for that."
They work well enough. Probably don't have the longevity of a Duracell but for the price you're coming out on top.
Not bad. They do the job and so far so good.
"I can't really tell much of a difference in performance to give a detailed analysis, but that is a good thing, really. They work! They aren't garbage and they are a lot cheaper than name brand, so they are worth it. If I ever really tell a difference based on their performance on multiple devices, I'lll update, but for now, they seem to be just fine."
"I don't know much about batteries, but these work....so I love them!"
I've never actually paid attention to how long batteries last in anything. Still don't. These are working though!
No problems. They do exactly what I would expect.
They're batteries and they work.
works like they're supposed to. They're AAA Batteries after all. Either they work or they don't. Makes it convenient to order them online than having to remember if you grabbed them from the store.
They work. I don't know how they compare...but I received these batteries very quickly.
They work. :)None of them have exploded.
"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
Works like a charm.
"They're AA batteries. They seem to work in the kid's toys. Hope they are long lasting. No idea how they compare to Eveready, Kirkland, or Duracell."
They're AAA batteries
"They're batteries, and cheap. So far they've worked great!"
they're batteries
They're batteries.
"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know."
"AmazonBasics batteries are definitely the way to go. Or at least if you need AA or AAA batteries (the 9v batteries aren't that great). You get a higher quantity for less the price compared to going to Target. And for what it's worth, I really like the simplicity of the packaging."
"Yup, they work."
"These batteries work just as well as any other, but cost less. The voltages are the same as any other one I tried- and in some devices I'm pretty sure (since I'm not a professor of Battery Science) they last longer than other brands."
Good price and the batteries work.
They're batteries. They seem to last as long as big name brands for much less cost.
They're batteries. They work. They're incredibly cheap. What more do you want
They're batteries....they do what batteries are suppose to do....
Perfectly fine batteries
"As with my review of the other batteries I reviewed, they're batteries. They all work and provide approximately 1.5vdc as supposed to."
Came on time and in one piece. Haven't noticed a difference in quality between these batteries and any other name brand.
They're good quality batteries for a really good price! You'd be stupid to pass this deal up!
I buy amazonbasics batteries in all the sizes that they make. they're great.
"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but..."
CheapDon't last all that long
"This are so good I keep coming back for more. I've used other brands and the so called good fall behind in performance. The top of the line, are really good, but they put a dent in my pocket. I use this all around the house along with the AAA ones. To all give it a try before you judge them, maybe you end up with a smile and extra cash from the saving."
Batteries can be so expensive when you are purchasing small quantities. This AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries 20-Pack was a great bargain that puts the batteries at 0.33 cents each or less. They work well.
This batteries are the best. Cost is cheap but last like top brands. Have reordered these many times and in different sizes. I will never buy a different battery brand again.
"This is a good deal, and it's alot of batteries for the price. Ten year shelf life is great, even 4 or 5 years would be good, so if they last 10 that's even better."
"This is a great deal for your money, better than Costco! Will definitely order more when I run out of them!"
"For the price, this is a great product. However, it definitely does not last as long as Duracell. Estimate time use is only about 1/2 or 1/3 of Duracell battery. Would buy again just because the pricing for the amount is still better."
"This is a heckuva deal on alkaline batteries. I bought them because my grandtoddler has a remote control truck that keeps getting left on, and of course that eats batteries. I replaced my expensive big brand with these, and so far they seem to be lasting just as long. I am well pleased, and will add these to my purchase rotation."
This is a smart purchase. The box comes with the batteries shrink wrapped in packages of four. Perfect for sharing and including in a gift package.
"This is definitely the best deal you'll find on batteries, they work really well and hold a charge comperitive to high dollar name brands"
We go through a lot of batteries. This is probably the best deal around. Enough said.
This is the standard Cut/Past Note for a product that for no other reason works and does a job but the Amazon folk wont let you get away without saying something.
I love these batteries from Amazon. I plan on stock piling my battery stock with all Amazon batteries. I am truly impressed on the packaging alone! Quality all the way! Great job Amazon!
What a deal!!! This is why I love Amazon. Thank You for the savings
"Why, why, why haven't I been buying AmazonBasics batteries my whole life Seriously, this might be my new favorite thing to buy online."
Excellent purchase. This will surely last me a while as I go through a lot of batteries for all of my gadgets.
"With having a child an all the toys that come along with that, this was a great price and quick shipping,"
Can't beat the price. My son has a lot of toys and burns through a lot of batteries. this was a perfect solution
This was a really good buy. I needed for a work function and it was exactly what we were looking for
This was my first order of Amazon batteries and I will definitely be ordering more. The value is there and there's no compromise in quality.
"Sorry that I don't have a photo to show- slipped my mind when unpack aging, though this was probably the best packaged thing I've ever received through the mail.. looks exactly like all the other photos that people have shown. Love it such a good price."

"battery drains out fast, unlike duracell"
Battery's charge ran out very quickly.
Bought as a gift to go with the vibrator.
Brand names are better. These were not very long lasting. You get what you pay for.
Brought wrong size for the walkie talkies i purchased..but can find use for them

Good price

GOOD USE

Have not had the opportunity ti critique
Haven't use the batteries at this time and expect 5 star performance.
Haven't Used Yet........
I didn't feel like they lasted as long as other batteries
I don't feel Amazon brand batteries are as powerful as other brands.
I don't feel like they last as long as the name brand batteries.
I feel like we change the batteries more often with these.
I have not fully tested these AA batteries so I don't have them evaluated.
"I haven,t had them long enough"
I like how i got so many itd months later and i still got a pack left!!
i meant to order AA and not AAA.I shall reorder
I think it was recargable
I wouldnt say they are worse or better then name brand batteries. about the same
I'll be paying extra for energizers they last longer.
I'm super charged over the price of these batteries!!!!
Inexpensive but doesn't last long.
It is ok
It's a battery...
its okay
Just normal batteries a little higher priced than I could get elsewhere
Lasted half the time as duracell in the same product
Lots of batteries. Not a lot of battery life.
love it
lower value as they last about one hour but good for a flash light
Made in the USA would make this a 5 star
maybe it's just me... but they don't seem to last very long
"Meh, they work, wud gladly pay more for USA made tho!"
Needed them in a hurry - don't last that long.
Not as strong and not lasting long enough as the major brands.
Not bad i guess
not crazy about these batteries. don't last as long as others for same time period
not dead
Not sure. have not fully tested the performance of this item.
not the longest lasting batteries. but they're batteries... we've gone through the package really quickly.
"Nothing special, just alkaline disposable AA batteries at fair price."
ok
Ok
OK for AAA needs
okay
"Okay, but do not last long."
Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :(

Seems like it doesn't last as long as other battery brands.
"seems to not last very long, curious."
Seems to work well

So far they have worked well. I do not know how to compare them on quality yet.
Some don't last as long as I hoped.
"Some work, some don't."
The don't last as long as I'd hoped.
The sound quality could be better. It's cute though...
There ok.
"these are not comparable to Duracell, but it's cheap"
These batteries discharge fairly quickly. But okay for the price
"These batteries don't seem to last as long as others. I would not call them performance, just cheap."
These batteries have a tendency to leak inside of devices and cause damage rendering them in operable
These batteries just don't seem to last as long as Everready batteries.
These didn't last very long.

They ran out of energy very quick but it's a deal
They run out of juice fast.
They seem to die faster than most batteries.
They work a bit better compared to big chain generic batteries
They're batteries
They're batteries.
They're batteries. They work.
They're just batteries like advertised
This is OK purchased as battery does not last long with cost paid.
Use them on my outdoor solar lights. They lasted 2 weeks and they stopped working.
Very poor batteries. I ordered a box and so far about 50 are either bad out of the box or very soon after.
Very weak batteries.
Was kind of disappointed they are made in China when US-sourced batteries are readily available.
we'll see how they hold up
Weird but some didn't last long as they should
Worked great.
Works
Works for what we needed.
works like any another.
Good price for good quality.
"Great price for all these batteries. No complaints on the performance, but I've only used them in remote controls"
"Love these batteries, i never like to run out of batteries, all sizes i hoard. Great quality, and they come in convienent storage boxes."
Great bang for the buck.
Great batteries for a great price.
Seemingly sufficient at a good price!
Just received - I Will give an up date as I use them -specifically - for my new and my old (for comparison) Garmin etrex 10's My old one ate batteries like a small snack. So much so that I could not depend on it for a long hike. But I really like its' feature set and the new one claims 20 hours on a set of two AA's. I don't expect them to operate as long as a name brand - But I have been surprised before.
Works as expected. Time will tell if AAA from amazon are a better value.
"Decent batteries, though they don't last like the big name brands."
"I got these to use in my classroom for various things, so far there is no difference between these and the duracell i was buying. Tons of batteries for a great price."
I bought these to have constant ammo for my XBox controllers and I am convinced I will never run out. Solid batteries for the money.
Great price and awesome batteries.
top product. highly recommend !
My neighbor gave me several of these to use when I was out of AA and needed some ASAP. These are just as good as the name brands alkaline batteries and absolutely no leaks of any kind including the pair I had outside last winter in the LED light. That is why I reordered a couple different times using AmazonBasics for AA and AAA. Recommended highly and easy to order and priced just right!
Junk - after trying 10 batteries one worked!
Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money.
same as the aa batteries. toys
"Tremendous Value! My kids go thru AA batteries at a ferocious pace. Doesn't matter the brand, they burn through them. These last as long as what we'd previously buy at the store, but at a fraction of the price!!!!"
"Triple A batteries at an amazing price Need I say morePretty basic, hence the basic logo. Don't waste on a different brand, but Amazon Basics!"
"Great purchase, value and quality!"
Useful triple A rechargeable batteries that will always come in handy.
The batteries work great thank you for the order will be ordering more soon.
"The sole noticeable difference between these and the big name brands is price.Side by side, they work almost exactly as long as the copper tops. Which makes me wonder who makes these."
works as you would think..grat price
"These batteries seem as good as any I've used this is a totally subjective, non-scientific valuation, but there you are. I like the price and I'll buy them again."
Tried this out. Loved the box. The package of individuals of 4 each is nice but not convenient at times. We tried these on a high drain police radio and a low drain Samsung personal radio.STICKING WITH MAXELL. They out perform these and its noticeable for about 3 more. Better value.
Great batteries and can't beat this price.
"Got them today. Came in twelve 4-packs stacked neatly in a compact cardboard box.HOWEVER,Two of the batteries were leaking so I threw away an entire 4-pack since all 4 batteries were a little slimy...but two were definitely leaking from the bottom. Makes me nervous that I had to use these in my three 120/ea. trail cams.The only reason I gave this a 2 star rating is the price for 44 batteries (instead of 48) was still a pretty good deal."
2 of my candles stop working after 2 weeks!!
2 way radio drained batteries daily so too expensive
A Great Price but not a great battery. They just don't last as long as the brand names.
"About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away"
Adequate
Bad shelf life. No where near Duracell. For very light duty only.
Batteries didn't last a year. Last several batteries were dead.
Battery Life on these is short. Disappointing.
Battiers dont last very long
can only use my wireless xbox controller for a few hours with two of these

Dies fast

excelentproduct
Found they didn't last as long as regular alkaline batteries....would not buy again
Go with a brand name.
Good price but didn't last to long
Half of the batteries were just dead
Half the batteries were dead or low charged out of the box.
I feel like they barely stayed charged.
I just dont trust em
I meant to purchase AA not triple
i use this batteries for my sound recorder and they exhaust way too quickly.
"I was disappointed, they do not last but a few days."
I went through these like water - stick with Duracell or Energizer.
I'm feeling like these are running out of performance faster than other batteries I've purchased.
I'm not particularly happy four of them have already had to be replaced they don't last very long
It doesn't seem as though these have a lot of juice. They haven't lasted very long.
Lots of the batteries didn't work. Maybe just my experience.
More then half don't work
Nice cheap battery. Will not last as long as a regular brand battery. You can even feel the difference
Not fresh. Run down fast.
Not great for remote control car.
Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase.......
Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity.
Ordered rechargeable got regularl alkaline batteries not happy at all
Poor longevity.
product ok
Seems like these don't last long at all
Several batteries don't work.
Some batteries didn't work
"some battery is dead when I just use it, sometimes need change a lot of new battery"
started leaking shortly after reciept
Stay away from this brand. Doesn't last long.
Strings are not as long as described.
The batteries came vacuum-sealed in packs of 4 in this really heavy/annoying plastic.
The batteries do not last nearly as long as other brands.
The package was delivered with only 40 batteries missing 8 batteries although it was perfectly closed and sealed
These batteries did not work in all items needing AAA batteries. I won't be ordering them again.
These batteries do not last very long at all.
These batteries don't seem to last as long as other brands.
These batteries maybe inexpensive but they don't last long. I have to replace them frequently.
These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries
These die really quick.
These don't seem to last as expected
These don't work very well
These have not lastedn very long just a couple of months in wall clocks.
They did last that long.
They do not last
They do not last very long.

They run out of power very quickly.
they seem to wear out really fast
"They were cheap yes, and it shows. They don't last long at all. You get what you pay for..."
THIS DIES SO EASILY
Very poor quality. Lasted on one week in motion sensor that is used infrequently.
Very short lifespan.
My Son Goes Through Double A Batterie and WHEN I Seen This Good Deal i Jumped ON it Theses ARE Great Batteries and WELL Worth it
Two thumbs up
"I was a bit hesitant to order these because, you know, low priced batteries. But guess what Good quality batteries at a low price. What more could you ask These are as good or better than Duracell for less money.Well, go ahead and get them! You KNOW you'll need them.Go ahead."
"Ahh, they're batteries so not much to say except they work LOL"
Unbeatable price and very good performers.
"These are great every day batteries, they work just as good as the name brands."
Great batteries at an incredible price! They don't work like discount batteries and I will now be ordering my batteries from Amazon in the future.
After several months of use the batteries have proven unreliable for production use in microphones. Duracell and Energizer are much more dependable have a reliable run-down pattern.However they work fine for in-home toys and games where you want cheap batteries on the shelf for instant replacement.
untrustworthy...dies really quick and doesn't keep the delivery date.
"Do NOT waste your money on these. I bought a box of 48 in November of 2015. It is now March of 2016, and we've used about a third of them. The rest are all dead already. 10-year shelf life!!! ... nowhere close."
though i try to use rechargeable batteries whenever possible but sometimes it isn't. these batteries be they AA or AAA have been an outstanding value. never a problem just a product that delivers without breaking the bank.Updated 12/4/16- have since come back for more AAA and AA all good and a great value.Updated 3/7/17- another order with good results!
"Upon counting, visually inspecting, sampling, and weighed each one, results indicated consistent specs and quality as the ad listing had implied."
Great buy and cannot tell and performance difference from other batteries
used Alexa to order was not just telling her to order and not having to go and look this up
DO not buy this product I've received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. As soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Tried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn't so apparently I'm just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!!
"I would give it zero stars if possible. Every single battery came dead. Every. Single. One. Completely useless and a waste of time to try and fight for a refund. Usually I have great faith in AmazonBasics, but now I'm not so sure."
Good price and delivery
Great value for the money
Love it! Last long time. Good to use.
Never run out of batteries with this
"These batteries arrived quickly. For the cost and number, I thought think that these area a great value and would purchase again."
Value
What a great value .
Value for money
Value for money
"KInda look like .357 rounds, eh Seriously, great value and surprisingly good lifespan."
Great value.
"The picture looks like the batteries are white, but they're actually silver. Helps from confusing them with eneloops or other rechargeables."
Can't beat the value of these batteries.
so cheep! work great
They work great!
Great value and fast shipping. Seem to last as long as other brands
"they work!they look pretty!they are cheap!they come fast!recommended!8 more words are needed, so - if you need batteries, buy these!"
I waited to make sure they AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack)would hold up. Great value!
"Very competitive product at good price. I originally rated this le, but learned I had. made a mistake in my install."
Great price for AA batteries. I needed a lot of them to maintain battery-powered Xmas window candles. These seem to be working fine. Easy-open cardboard package is very convenient.
"I hoped that an Amazon-branded product would have decent quality, but these batteries are just terrible. Their charge will last for about 1/10 of the usual top brands. Very disappointed. I'm never buying an Amazon battery again."
"I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users."
"My Mother in Law owns a home decor store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks, etc. We ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store. Once they were on they only lasted about 30 minutes. She then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries. Really disappointing and a huge hassle for her. Have never had batteries last such a short time. We were very unhappy."
Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.
"The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Wii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V"
"All 20 of the batteries are dead (no power). Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon's name on it that is useless, especially as a Prime member."
"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better."
Many of these batteries are not working at all. Very disappointed.
"I have several Amazon basics products and always tell my friends how much I love them. after purchasing Amazon basics AA batteries and AAA size, I was very disappointed. every single battery lasts a day or two on a power toothbrush, an xbox wireless controller, a roku remote and other daily gadgets. I am extremely surprised, since I buy batterie brands like rite aid, acme, Walmart, etc."
Exactly what you would expect. Very good price and nicely packaged.
Hi folks... these are just good all around batteries. Used them for years.
Perfect and I love this product.
Work great for the price. Very comparable to the big names
Very good Alkaline Batteries! I was surprised at the performance and longevity of these batteries!
"So far, these batteries are very good. I like to have a large quantity on hand so I don't have to always be buying a battery. The price was real good and I have nothing negative to say."
Nice for the price!
These are great- I use these and the AAA and they've performed well for me. I'm giving 4 stars because I haven't formally tested them but I do order them regularly.
These worked very nicely-no complaints-I use a lot packaged very nice as well. I got good use out of this Amazon battery-try it!
They seem to last as good as Duracell procell
Amazon's doing most things well and have been for quite a while. These Amazon brand batteries are as good as the other copper top!!!
Very pleased with these batteries as I ordered both these and triple A's and was amazed at the life of these batteries. will absolutely reorder as needed.
Very good batteries. Much cheaper than the others.
"It's great, works nicely"
"Lasts as expected, very good battery quality"
"Cheap, good and Prime 2 day delivery. How can you go wrong"
"About 1/3 the price of anything in Wal-Mart. With 3 kids, we use a lot of batteries."
"Work fine, very good price, good batteries! Word to the wise check the good to date on the Batteries, if possible! Some places lower the prices when close or past good to date. Past a good chance or bad of leakage."
These batteries work well and have a good life expectancy. Excellent product and great price.
"The Amazon product line seems to have decent products. These batteries are no exception. There are many reviewers who will say these batteries are terrible, good, great, awesome, unsurpassed, etc. It seems the general consensus is these batteries are great for their intended purpose.First, I recommend you take a look at C (https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35H8Y36S43CSG/refcmcrdppdp) review. This is a highly credible review as he put in his time and effort to test the batteries out. With that said, here are my two cents on batteries I have previously bought on Amazon:Rayovac: Smart choice for your portable digital electronics, lasting just a little less long as other leading brands. They are perfect for powering low-drain devices like clocks, radios, remote controls and low-powered flashlights. If you're looking for an affordable and reliable battery, get these. But it only works for me on 3-5 uses using my eyelash curler. These are good and cheap batteries. I use them for simple things that don't require a lot of power, such as my computer mouse. They do not last long, but for the price I pay I don't expect them to. if I want a quick battery that isn't going to cost more than a couple dollars I usually go with these.Duracell:Despite the shorter use by date (3/2021) than my recently purchased Energizer Industrial AAA alkalines (12/2026), these ProCell (Duracell) alkaline AAA cells have the highest open circuit voltage I've ever measured. I admit to being a price shopper, opting for 48 for 15 (Prime) rather than 24 for 11. If I get results similar to the ProCell AA and D cells I recently purchased, the AAA's should be good performers. Sadly, they are a too-tight fit to use in my recent Surefire Titan (flashlight) one AAA cell LED flashlight - but that is on the Surefire. I received decent life on these batteries besides using them in a flashlight (remote control car, remote, smoke alarm (7 months) and others. Good batteries for the right price.Energizer:I have used these in my mouse for my computer, my Xbox 360 Remote and my cable box remote. Part of me feels like these didn't last as long as they could have, but my mouse never gets shut off and my Xbox gets used relatively often (I'm not a gamer, but I use the system to watch movies).I read other reviews where people say that one of the sellers is selling used batteries I didn't have that experience. Mine arrived in a package that didn't seem to have been tampered with prior to shipping.I just ordered some Duracell Procell batteries. I want to see if they'll last longer than these did and they did not.Energizer Lithium:I put these batteries into all of the electronic Z-wave door locks that I own, because the Duracell alkaline batteries that I had been using were dying very quickly (they'd only last a about 2 months, and rechargeable ones would only last 3-4 weeks). The locks are very low-drain because most of the time they are just sitting there, but when you unlock or lock it uses a large burst of energy. And that's exactly the type of device that lithium batteries are recommended to be used in. I installed these about 4 months ago and they're all still showing 100 charge in my system control panel! Granted it only moves in 25 levels so it could be anywhere from 76-100, but still even if it depleted at a rate of 25 every 4 months that means they'll be good for at least 1 year before being replaced. That's about 6x longer than alkaline batteries would last, or if they live up to the claim of 8x then I'll get 16 months out of them. Either way I'll be saving a lot of time and money not having to swap out batteries every few months, I can now put it on my yearly to-do list instead.I also use the 9V batteries in my smoke detectors, and according to the specs they should only need to be changed every 10 years instead of the 2 years that I was getting with alkalines. Sure they are 5-7x more expensive (depending if you buy in bulk or not), but I'll gladly pay that price to not have to get up on a ladder in the middle of the night to swap out beeping smoke detector batteries all the time.Amazon Basics Batteries:The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand like you would get with the Energizer lithium. For the most part, they will perform like all the major brand with the exception of Rayovac. I find these last longer than then. As for regular Energizer and Duracell, I feel the difference is negligible. Some may or may not last longer than the Amazon brand while the others WILL last longer. I suppose it depends on the application they are used for.So in turn, yes I would recommend these to the typical consumer. The price is cheaper, the quality should be comparable to the rest. I would give them a try. If they are crappy then youre out a couple of bucks. Probably the same price when you decided to order the liver and onions you didnt like at so and so :P"
Very good price this this many AA batteries. I'm very pleased at this buy. Now we'll just see how long they last!
"This many batteries at this price How is that even possible Amazon is really competing against other product's prices with their amazon basics line. I bought these a while ago and will be buying again. Batteries in my household go by quick. This pack of 48 is great for my needs and the batteries themselves pretty good themeslves. I'll admit that Duracell are better in terms of performance and durability but they can be expensive sometimes. I feel like energizer are also a step above these but for the price, you can't go wrong. They do last long (depending on use) and seem like a better option compared to the cheap batteries found at gas stations of dollar stores. Great purchase overall."
Really good working.
Very good deal and quality!
Very good product.I find they work better than some name brands.
All are working as they should. Very good purchase.
Good quality batteries at a reasonable price.
Very good value and price! I could get batteries at the store for maybe 10pk or 20pk for 16.99-32.99 I rather buy all my batteries here!!!
"I've ordered these before and was very pleased. I've just recieved my second set and the quality has held steady. My 5 kids are hardcore gamers and we go through batteries faster than toilet paper, it seems. These are solid performance batteries at an excellent price. I used to buy my batteries in bulk at Costco, but they've raised their prices significantly, so I was thrilled to find these on Amazon for MUCH less. Highly recommended."
"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
Great batteries. Amazon brand is excellent.
No issues. Batteries have lasted longer than other store name brands. Very happy.
"these batteries last a long time, very happy to have found them on such a great deal"
"Great products, great quality and a really good quantity . Thank you , I'm very happy with my purchase."
"I just received these and immediately tested all 24 with my trusty digital multi-meter....22 tested excellent to better than normal, and two tested right in the normal to little less than normalto what any commercial brand battery tests...therefore, I'm very happy with this shipment, but I'll review the life-span in the field with daily use in our irrigation drip system-timers and post that when I have results. thanks Amazon!...I will buy these again!"
Amazon will become my battery supplier in the future. Very happy with the purchase.
"Ok, I'm hooked on these batteries! With 4 kids in my house, we go through a lot of batteries. I'm constantly buying them and they are very expensive. Amazon batteries are so cheap and they have lasted just as long as Duracell and energizers. I am very impressed and will keep ordering these over any other brand. Very happy with these batteries!"
Very happy with this purchase and I am hard to please! Thank you !
"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!"
These are every bit as good as the big name brands for a fraction of the price. I have found my new go to battery brand!!!
"Very impressed with this batteries, I am an energizer consumer and had been for years before descovering amazon basics"
I ran a test with these batteries because I was skeptical. I ran a Sennheiser wireless mic transmitter for nearly twelve hours and the receiver ran for over 16. These are great numbers. I can get through a full day of shooting with a handful of these.
"These batteries without a doubt have lasted longer than any other we've tried!! :-)As long as these continue to provide such long lasting quality, we'll keep buy them!Thanks Amazon!"
These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries.
They were very good
As good as any other brands like rayovac or that other one I cant think of .
very nice
Very nice product and I'm very happy with it. My experience with this seller was excellent. I would not hesitate to deal with them again.
Been using these batteries for almost a year. Very pleased with them
Seller has a real value pack in this quality battery for the price. Very pleased with the manner in which the product was boxed and then packaged for delivery - Very secure packaging and this was important considering the product. I'll be buying again.
Bought these for laser tag guns I purchased for my sons birthday (each requires 4) and they have literally played all night and morning and they are still going strong. I've bought much more expensive brand name batteries that haven't lasted this long. For the price I'm very pleased with this purchase!
Stock up. Always top notch..no leaks yet. Main brands have wrecked many of my Mag Lights and other equipment. Very well made.
This is my 3rd order of AmazonBasics batteries. Very pleased.
First eight batteries I tried barely had a charge at all! Don't wast your money.
"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it."
Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.
"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these."
"Good price, good product"
Love Amazon batteries seem to last long.
"High quality item, just as described. Very fast shipping. Very satisfied customer."
I am very satisfied with these batteries. I have ordered them before and not experienced any problems. Good quality and value.
"Lot's of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don't know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a TV remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me."
"Very short life. I was really expecting a decent battery, but unfortunately it wasn't."
Horrible. Amazon batteries are the WORST!! I have a battery operated little decorative light string. 2 Duracell batteries will light those things for weeks. 2 amazon batteries last about (and I'm not kidding) maybe 4 hours. Complete waist of money. Dollar store batteries are better. Do NOT purchase these
"I didn't have high expectations for these batteries - inexpensive as they were. But they've managed to last at least as long as the name brand we've purchased in the past! With a 4 year old and several battery operated toys, we seemingly traded our consumption of diapers for batteries - we need to buy them by the case. Trying to keep the toys off when not in use and 'save' the batteries is a concept my 4 year old does NOT grasp. So while he's having a great time with a toy in the evening, by morning it was dead. So fresh batteries to the rescue. AmazonBasics batteries are not only cost effective, but they have a life span at least equal to previous name brand batteries we've bought.We will be buying more of these (probably a LOT more!)"
"I was not expecting much when i bought these batteries. I was proven wrong. Weve had these same batteries in everyday devices, including a kids toy that is used daily, for 2 months. With duracell batteries i was replacing them about once a month in this very same toy. They are still going strong. I will be buying these from now on. Name brands do not compare to these batteries."
"Four in the batch leaked and caused a mess in my charger and device. I threw out the remaining to avoid future problems. In addition, the batteries didn't hold their charge. I presume I must have received a bad batch based on all the positive reviews."
I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work.
Spend the money and buy a name brand. These seriously do not work at all. Such a waste of money
"These batteries are ok, i've already had to replace them in my wireless keyboard, which had previously lasted 6 months on el cheapos from harbor freight."
These batteries DO NOT last. They are a waste of money.
These batteries don't last long. Waste of money.
These batteries last 5 minutes. Waste of money.
"I just open several new, cello packs to use in a motorized window shade cartridge. Loaded them up, plugged the cartridge in - nothing. Took the batteries out and checked each one in a battery tester. 3 of the 12 batteries were good. I opened up several more new packages and tested them before loading them into the cartridge. One out of every five had a charge, and the ones that had a charge were not strong charges. The rest are going to battery recycling. When it comes to batteries, you get what you pay for."
"These are awful. So far I've used them in my toothbrush, and have had to replace them 3 times in 6 months. I've also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that 6 month period as well. Seriously I usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector. Waste of money."
Terrible batteriesDon't last longDon't depend on theseYou're better off buying batteries at the dollar store then here
Stopped working after 6 months. Had to throw them away. What a waste.
Have tried these in various battery powered devices and they fail very quickly. I won't use them any more as I don't like having to dispose of dead batteries
"So far so good, but recently one of the AA size batteries made by Amazon was totally dead. The others so far seem to be up to par, but I wish this dead one could have been eliminated before it was sent to me."
"They perform well and the price is fine, but it's not entirely clear when it automatically switches you to AA size when you choose the larger quantity. Amazon snuck in a box of AA on me that way when I was expecting these AAA. Bad, Amazon. Bad."
Way better price than name brand like engergizer. I have a little boy who needs batteries for everything. This way he don't break the bank.
Great value and packaging is awesome!
"Long life, great price!"
We aren't running out of batteries now for game controllers. They seem to work just as well as any name brand.
"We buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we had a way to get them to us. Theseas as long as the dollar store batteries. Some items 2 weeks, others 1. I will not buy again."
We've ordered these several times...seems like they actually last longer than other name brands!
Works just as well as the pricier name brand version. We have 3 kids under 5 and go through batteries like its our job. Will continue to buy these from amazon from now on.
we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. i have installed them in multiple products and they are barely lasting any time at all. we will not be buying these again. maybe amazon can provide us with a new batch as maybe we just got unlucky with ours.
"Have been using these for several months. We have young kids so many toys that go thru batteries like crazy. So far, great purchase."
We love Amazon batteries! They seem to last as long as the name brand and are a fraction of the price!
"Great batteries. Very strong, and last as long as anything else out there."
We ordered these batteries all the time! The price is so much more reasonable than name brand batteries and they work just as well. We have a toddler running around our house so as you can imagine ever single toy we own needs batteries.Totally satisfied with our purchase every time!
We've been using this in our backyard laser tag guns. We have played many times and I have not had to replace them yet. They seem to be keeping their charge very well even with our guns.
We've ordered these batteries twice now and they're great. They really last in my kids toys and for the price you can't beat it. They last in a furby that's played with just about 14 hours out of the day for over a week (which is awesome!)
"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
They're not strong enough to power my kids' toys... so far they only work with tv remotes. :(
"For the price,they are well worth it."
Well i am a fan of the Amazon Basic items. They are life saver for me.I don't have much to say as Amazon basic quality and economy prices are well know to everyone.Thank you Amazon for the Amazon Basic items.
Well I just received my second order of these batteries and of course they will come in handy with the holidays here. I have several of those artificial candles on my mantelpiece and they go through batteries like they are free. So now I am sure I have enough to get through the next several weeks!
"I wasn't sure about buying these at first. Now I'll be buying more when I'm through with the pack. I use them for my Bose Quiet Comfort 15 and they work better than Duracell Quantum, and way cheaper. I'm not to sure on the time difference between them though, I just know I'm not changing them out as often."
Batteries work as advertised. Well packaged and pleased with this purchase.
"Can't beat the price. Well packaged, door to door what more can you ask"
nice price
"I have used Amazon Basics before and so far I have liked their products. When I was needing more batteries, I noticed Amazon had a line through their Amazon Basics company. I ordered a set and thought I would give it a try. I have not done any fancy testing for the life or usage you get from these batteries compared a name brand one, but they do work and appear to have lasted about the time amount of time."
Nice batteries for the price. Second time I've bought these.
Great batteries at a great price! These really last a long time and are great for all the battery operated Christmas decorations.
These have to be the best batteries for the price. I am always having to buy batteries for all my electronic devices. When I found that Amazon had their own brand I figured I would give them a try. I have to say that they really are just as good if not better than the major name brand batteries.
"These batteries are, umm, batteries. They are high quality. They last a decent period of time."
"I use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basics product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the AAs as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch"
"These batteries are fairly priced for their quality. Which is to say, they need replacing 4 or 5 times more often than a name brand battery."
It's been quite a while since I've needed batteries and I didn't want to pay the brick-and-mortar prices. They came well-packaged and according to Amazon they keep well. I haven't needed to use more than 2 but I can say that it came fully powered and I hope they keep as well as advertised!
Went through these fast at a wedding I shot. Used these in my external flashes. I'm sure it was the power of the lights but man they went quick. Lots of bang for your buck though!
decent quality
Great value for a ton of batteries for our way too many kid toys !
"I love these batteries. First they are priced cheaper than the name brands but offer the same performance. They come in no frustration packaging instead of the terrible clamshells that most batteries from the store do. The cardboard box offers a handy place to store them in without being cut by the plastic or having them fall out of the pack. Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be powering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision anytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback."
"I like to buy some things,like these batteries,off brand and in bulk.No leaks,work well in all of my AA devices and battery life is,likeany store bought one,dependent on my use and quality of device.I will purchase again."
What a great price. Love having extra batteries around the house at Christmas time.
"Great price, I haven't compared them side by side with any other batteries. I haven't notice any differents in performance."
These worked for about 8 hours and then were dead. What a waste!
What can I say. They're AA Alkaline Batteries and they're affordable.-1 Star because the packaging was GIGANTIC compared to the size of the actual batteries.
"Sets the standard, no more no less, better price than competition, so should be a clear choice!"
What can you say it's battery that works good life span. Time will tell if they leak or not. Great Buy!
"I won't need batteries for a long time and comes in a real nice strong case, love it!"
I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.
"What happened to the green and silver amazon batteries Those worked great. These new ones are terrible. Very short battery life. I've been through two boxes of 48, thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time, same results."
a ton of AA batteries for cheap. What is there not to like
"What is there not to like Combined with an alkaline battery charger (like the idigital one) it works great and the batteries are really cheap. So what if these get fewer recharges, you get 4x as many for the price. Just don't charge them in a regular charger, it requires a special battery charger that specifically has alkaline support or it will explode."
These batteries do the job.
Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.
"Amazon started this wonderful company way back when. Can you remember when there was NO Amazon, neither can I. The company became so successful at selling someone else's products, Amazon decided to start selling their own, thus Amazon Basics was born. Amazon Basic encompasses so many products, that are sold at such a reasonable price with excellent quality,that you should always look for Amazon Basics first.Recently, my Amazon Echo's remote, stopped working. I use the remote so much as a Bluetooth, information giver etc etc etc, and guessed correctly that the AAA battery had run it's last mile. I had one battery left, inserted it and off we went. I realized I need to obtain a new supply of batteries, and entity Amazon's website. I found the Amazon Basics batteries,meets price and in a quantity of eight. I am now prepared for the holiday onslaught of battery needs. Just insert into your product and off you go.Recommended. prisrob 10-20-15"
I'm not a battery expert in any way. I just know that I needed batteries and these seemed cheap. I've used them in many devices and can't tell any difference in performance or longevity.
AAA batteries at a reasonable price. No difference in longevity than any of the major brands. Just cheaper and delivered to my door. What's not to like
"Have not had a chance to use batteries through to test lifespan, but for the price, what's not to like"
"I like that they come in shrink-wrapped sets of 4 each... It keeps a mess down, plus grabbing a few is really easy.They seem to hold up pretty close to the other top brands, though I've done no scientific testing! I assume if there is a difference, for practical purposes, the cost-savings would heavily outweigh the performance. However, if you're going to space, you might want to really test which batteries last longest - down to the minute."
You can buy these at a good price and they seem to last as well as any of the big brands. So I will continue to buy these batteries.
"They're batteries, what's not to love"
Good batts good price. Would repeat.
"Amazon does a good job with these batteries. When you have young kids and lots of electronics, buying in bulk and buying quality is key."
"So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again."
"WTH!! Went through these extremely fast - it seems there were many DUDS filtered in with a few good batteries!! by the time I realized this, it was over thirty days, so live and learn."
"A less costly alternative to the name brands, which seems to work just fine."
"These batteries are just TERRIFIC!!!! I did not want to pay the price for those small pkg.Copper tops.I never thought that these would be just as good.But,Amazon you proved me wrong. Great Price and Great Deal.."
Work like batteries! Who reads reviews about batteries
They are batteries. They work. Trust me. They're inexpensive. It's amazon. Stop reading reviews on batteries and just buy some.
"They last a long time, have a good value, and are delivered to my door. I really can't complain."
These work as well or better than name-brand batteries. Anyone with kids knows the batteries end up costing as much as the toy after replacing them multiple times. I buy them in bulk in all sizes.
Why buy expensive batteries from Target or Lowes or Home Depot These much less expensive batteries are sure to do the trick! They work just as well at a fraction of the cost its a no-brainer purchase.
These seem to be just as good as the name brands and are a much better value.
"I use a lot of AAs in my xbox control due to my headphones. Name brand batteries were nickle and diming me, and then I stumbled upon a Amazon deal of the day and next thing I know I have a box of these. Literally can't see a difference in name brand batteries and these, and these are much much cheaper. Will only ever buy Amazon Batteries from now on"
I bought a pkg of name brand batteries for almost 9.00 for a pack of ten . Now these batteries I bought were about the same price in all the flyers in the area as well as the local stores . Long story short these Amizon basic batteries work much better than the batteries I bought ( more than once so different lots ) than the more expensive ones . I have lots of flameless candles that come on twice a day and I was going thru lots of batteries . Not any more . And they are running strong in other things too . Who would have thought . Fully expected to be dissatisfied to be honest because of price difference . But no . Great product .
Why notI gave them a shot and I do not notice a negative difference from other brand batteries. The positive is the packaging. They come in 4s and so you do not have to open the entire pack for a few.
"Why ever pay retail store price for a simple battery. Shelf life is so long they will still be fresh years from now. There are only a few battery manufacturers in the world. Hey Bob, what brand we running on the line today.20 each."
"Yes, they're AAA batteries, and they work as advertised... batteries come in a perfectly sized compact box, which can also be kept for storage purposes. Great shelve life too!!"
"Pretty cheap, good, long lasting batteries. We bought these and are currently using. I was a little worried buying cheaper batteries, cause most of the time they hardly last. These do though! Anyways, no issues with it at all, great bulk buy too."
"Amazon batteries work just as well as other brands, why waste your money!"
"They're just like the high performance AA batteries you can get anywhere else, except here they don't cost as much and you can get a whole ton of them all at once."
Love love love Amazon batteries. Every one that I've ordered performed just as well as the name brand batteries.
"Great batteries, last a long time with full power."
Great price for alot of batteries
My husband uses these in a night vision scope. He says they last longer than the name brand
Very happy with my purchase of these. We fly thru batteries at my house so this was a good investment. The ones I've used so far seem to be working great and haven't died yet.This would be great for Christmas time toys!
"So far these have held up. No reason to just but a few of any brand battery... So I bought a whole bunch. They're good. I don't keep track of how long Duracell or Energizer or Amazon run in things because remotes, video games, etc always go through spells of being the favorites at different times at our house. I know they work :) they're cheaper! The way i do tell is how fast I go through them and I still have a lot left from this same pack. So considering, these are equal to the other name brand and costly batteries that i've been stuck on for years. Time for a change )"
great deal seems like good quality
Great product
I'm happy with the product and the price! Amazon basics is my new battery company!
Fast delivery and great price.
Very happy with them. Work as well as name brand ones that are twice the price.
Best batteries that I have purchased.
Good batteries. Great price!
I was skeptical buying these batteries but they last just as long as the Duracell batteries that I have bought and longer than other brands I have triedI use them in my LED lights and candles so yes I use them daily
Love buying batteries from Amazon. For this many it is a great price and you don't have to carry them home from the store.
LOTS of batteries for cheap! I've used a few of them and appear to have full charge for stuff I put them in. I like keeping stocked up on all batteries so I always have them on hand when needed. Will definitely but AmazonBasics batteries again.
Have used about half of these now with no issues. They seem to last as long as the name brands and in this house double AA are always needed.
They're batteries that do what they're supposed to do and last a long time. What else is there to say Will happily buy these again. :)
Lots of batteries for a real decent price. Will have check back to confirm they are a great deal !
"not worth the money, they did not last very long, batteries would go dead, will not buy again"
These batteries only last 2-3 days in my tv remote
BATTERIES have a very SHORT LIFE... WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN..
Hassle free packaging and long expiration
Good price and work well.
"These don't last long. Won't be buying anymore, wish they had been better!"
but do last longer than Duracell
do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries
Amazon Basics are killing it with alot of their products working great and being very reliable and these batteries are another great reason to buy into the Amazon Basics Brand :D
Cheap batteries poor performance. I put two in our Roku remote and they died within a day. Same thing happened with the TV remote.
"These batteries work. They don't last as long as I'd like but they do work fine. They came in frustration free packaging that I ended up needing scissors to open because they batteries come shrink wrapped in a little box and getting the plastic off of the batteries was NOT frustration free. So, three stars because they work but aren't great. I will probably not re-order these."
Put these AA batteries in smoke detectors and they immediately start the low battery beeps. Pulled them back out going to see about returning them all - or they will goto recycling. :-(
They don't seem to be working very well - - last a day or so in the remote
I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.
Excellent quality batteries.
Good batteries.
"Wonderful quality batteries, and they arrive in a nice little case. Recommended! (Love Amazon Basics -- all products in this line I have purchased have been superb.)"
These batteries are awesome! Just as good as the name brand for a fraction of the price! Great job Amazon!
So far I can't tell the difference from other name brand batteries. Wonderful to be able to purchase batteries at this price and be delivered free by being a Prime Member.
Over half were dead or real close to.dead and ones that did work lose power really fast. Very disappointed in Amazon on these and their aaa.
Great price
"Same or better quality as other batteries at a price that beats the competition, by a considerable amount in most cases."
Great value. So far they seem to work just as well as name brand batteries for a fraction of the cost.
"I needed some and the price is good! Liked the packaging...they don't all roll out when opened at one end (no so with some of the normal name brands)! Seem to be lasting as long as the other brands (but I will let you know if that statement changes).Amazon is a good brand. I'll reorder when I need more!Yep, I recommend this product"
Work as well as the name brands and alot in price.
"We love these batteries. We use them on everything from led candles, remote controls, watering timers, and toys. In our non scientific testing, they seems to last just as long as any name brand battery. We keep ours in the refrigerator until we need them. No charge issues after a year of storing them."
"These are fine and the price is right. I normally get the box of 48 Maxell batteries and... this is not objective... but I feel like those batteries last longer. Still, these batteries are fine and do what they're intended to do. They're certainly not long-life though."
"Good batteries, minimal packaging. Good price per quality."
These seem to work as well as any in normal devices. They don't last long enough in the high drain but they are much cheaper than putting the lithium in everything
"Work just as they should. What more can you say, they're batteries, they work"
Work fine
Buy a bunch before they realize how great these batteries are and raise the price.
Great batteries. Work well in our devices needing this size.
They worked as expected. No complaints
work as good as expensive batteries
Work fine. These are really nice and they are cheap.
Work great
"never run out of AA batteries again, Amazon to the rescue!! i keep these on subscribe save one month i get AA the next AAA and so on...great batteries for the price!"
They work well and I have not noticed a decline in performance from name brand batteries.
These batteries are quite the bargain! Work great for me.
"Work great in some devices but not some (like some brands of cordless mouse). Still, a good value for many uses."
"Work Great, Great Value"
"So far these are holding up very well and for the price, couldn't pass them up."
"Lots of 'em, and cheap. And they work, no leaks and last as long as 'the other guys' out there. When you have kids and 4,000 toys that take (and eat) batteries, you can't beat the price and reliability. Thank you Amazon!"
"Great inexpensive batteries, good as any on the market!"
"Got these for a great deal, and they last just as long as the name brand!"
Great deal!
I decided to order amazon basics batteries because I've ordered some other amazon basics stuff and they seem pretty quality. These have worked fine since I've started using them and I haven't had any problems.
These batteries are a great price and work just as well as name brand batteries.No complaints by me.
These batteries dont quite hold up to the same time and durability of Duracell or other name brand but they are a great alternatives! More than worth the price.
These batteries work great! I love the price! You can't beat this price anywhere else even with coupons!
They work as expected and so far are lasting in the devices!
They work just as good as Energizers
Work just fine and better price than in the stores!
"Definitely Batteries, Definitely AAA! Work great! Great Price!"
"Will buy these again. They work great, last at least as long as Duracell and Energizer, and they are a good value."
Work great. Battery life is better than I expected.
Work just as good as the name brand batteries. I will only be buying amazon batteries from now on.
"I'm really happy with these, they really surprised me. They're head to head with top brands eg. Energizer, Duralast, Raovac. I'm definitely going to buy my batteries from here now, they're such a good deal for such great performing batteries :)"
Cheaper than the store! Work just as good.
Work just as well as name brand and cheaper.
"great deal. for me, they work just as well and just as long as the name brand batteries. I love that they come in handy easy to story cardboard boxes as opposed to large bulky plastic packages."
Work just as well as other but cheapeR!
"Cant see any difference from the more expensive Duracell batteries. Great price. Use them for flashlights clocks, and remote controls."
"These are some of the most inexpensive batteries I can find and I go through a LOT of batteries due to all of the battery powered cat toys and human toys I own.My cats have five toys that use AA batteries and my Xbox controllers use AA batteries, so I feel like I am always switching batteries out on one thing or another. In the past I would buy the cheap 4 packs of batteries from the 99cent store. They were decent, brand name and lasted about as long as the more expensive ones from a normal store. However, the 99cent store stopped selling the 4 packs and the 2 packs aren't worth the price and effort of making a special trip to a 99cent store. I bought a 16 pack of regular Duracell extra long life batteries at Target recently and went through those batteries just as fast as the 99cent store variety. Not okay.That's when I took to the internet. Good ol' Amazon has their own batteries for a much cheaper price What Perfect!I ordered a big ol' box of them and they truly do last as long as (or longer than) the name brand batteries I have purchased elsewhere but for a much better price.Now my nocturnal cats can play with their toys all night while I sleep and I can play Xbox until my fingers bleed, all for a better price. :D"
Work just fine
Wonderful batteries that seem to be well-worth the price we paid!
Bought them as an add-on and will order again when we need them. Work just like any major name but at a fraction of the cost
They last as long as the name brand and save some bucks too !!
Cheap. Work like any other.
Work.
No problems so far. Seem to last a long time. Very happy. Great deal.
Batteries arrived on time with Prime. Batteries are packaged well for shipping and storage. Work perfect for TV remotes and kids toys
"I've become a big fan of the Amazon Basics line of batteries over the years. They work just as well as the name brands we're all familiar with and I have never run across any of the Amazon Basics batteries that were dead in the box. We seem to run through the AAA size in various remote controls like crazy around here, so buying them in the multi pack box is both convenient and a money saver."
They work just as well as any other battery. No issues with leaks or other battery problems. Cheaper than most competitors as well.
Batteries work pretty well and you can't beat the price
Batteries 1.5 volts supply current what else can you say
No issues with them.
"Seem to work ok, but less than Energizer in my camera. Otherwise they are a great item with a great price."
"These work well in heavy duty use, I use them for my bicycle lights"
"Work like batteries should, got a bunch cheap"
Work well and cheaper than name brand batteries you buy at the store.
Work well.
"I used to buy bulk energizer batteries at the club stores but these are cheaper, delivered to my home, and work just as well. Will definitely continue to purchase."
So far so good with these Amazon Basic batteries as i have only had them for a short period. Only time will tell how they perform or if they are prone to leakage over time.
They work!
"Work well so far, but cannot tell yet long term"
"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."

"I go through a lot of AA batteries, and AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries are among the best I've used for the price. Costing less than 25 cents per cell, they cost about 40-50 less than name brand batteries. I use the AmazonBasics batteries in all sorts of electronic devices, and I don't see any noticeable difference between them and the name brand alkaline batteries. These are excellent batteries for the price."

worked great
Worked as advertised!
"Worked as expected, they last as long as Duracell's so far. I use them in my digiscale and instant read meat and infrared thermometer."
ok for the price
Worked great and no issues. Price made purchase affordable for family and able to use desired item that needed batteries. Great product and price.
"What a bargain! These seem to last about the same as the generics you'd buy at your local department store, but at half the price, especially when you get them on subscribe and save. Worked great to battery up all the Christmas goodies this year."
"I loved these batteries until 2 nights ago when one exploded in my camera flash. Not worth saving money on batteries when I now have to replace a 400 professional Nikon Flash. Battery acid leaked out of my flash door and all over my Nikon D600 camera and then on my hands before I realized what the loud,pop sound was."
Worked great!
Worked great!
"Worked perfectly, as described."
"These batteries work just as good as any other alkaline battery, have not had one leak yet. and the price can't be beat."
Seemed to work just like any other batteries. My boys have had them running in their remote control cars for hours.
So far works great
These batteres worked great.
"We always seem to be running out of batteries no matter how many we purchase. I have used other Amazon Basics products in the past, so I thought I would give these a try. The batteries appear to be very similar to any other AAA battery one might purchase. I do have a better tester, and was able to confirm the ones I tested were fully charged.We have been using some of the batteries for a week or so now in various items (weight scale / remote), and they appear to be performing just fine. Of course, the real test will be to see if they last as long as the batteries they replaced. But, at least for now, I am going to give them 5-stars based upon how they are currently performing."
These are working pretty well for me. They might be lasting SLIGHTLY less long than brand name Energizers. But they also cost a little less. Overall I'd say it's a push between brand names and these based on cost per time they last. But they work fine.None of that is said with any kind of scientific testing. That's anecdotal based on how often I feel like I'm replacing batteries.The short version is that I'm happy with these and would buy them again.I got a pack of AAA's too and those work fine as well
"Used 4 from this pack right away, and they seem to be fine."
"This item is at amazing price point for all of us that use lots of batteries !!Usually I buy my batteries for much higher price ,The price is super rightAnd working rest so farHighly recommend"
"Typically, I stick to Duracell so I was sceptical about 'Amazon brand' batteries. And buying them definitely gave my family more fuel to tease me about my alleged Anazon addiction. So far, they're working well. They're keeping the Wii Remote alive, which is vital to our Netflix usage. Plus, the price was amazing (8.49 for a 24 pack of AA, wow!) I'll update my review if this opinion changes.UPDATE: I bought these on June 10th, 2017. On that day, I replaced the Wii remote with 2 of the batteries. Today, which is July 12, 2017, they needed to be replaced. Subsequently, I can say that these lasted just a little over a month. Note that the remote is used a lot. Duracell batteries usually last almost 2 months, but since they cost over 2 times what these cost, I'm still overall happy with the Amazon brand."
Are a real budget beater
Cheap Quality Batteries
does what its suppose to do but doesn't really seem to have a lot of juice in them
Good so far
ok
Worked and cheap.
Works as expected. Item arrived working and in good condition
Great value and works just like any other battery. Very economical and good deal.
Works as expected! Can't beat the amazon price!
Works as good as any other alkaline battery out there at a much better price. I will definitely buy again!
Works as good as Duracell but half the cost and twice the batteries
Keeps the remote for the TV working so my lazy butt does not have to get up and manually change channels!
"I purchased these for the office and they worked so well, I order a set for home. With an 8 year old boy, we go through an insane amount of batteries. These work as well as the name brands. Definitely will be purchasing again."
"Bought these for use in a wireless mic transmitter. With that being said the transmitter gets use very consistently for the same amount of time every week. I went through a box of Duracell and would change the batteries every 3 or 4th week consistentl. With these Amazon Basics Battery I have been changing every 4th week. In short, my experience is these batteries perform just as good or better than the Duracell."
"works as intended, purchased this for my point and shoot camera"
Works.
"The title says it all.It's nice to buy cheaper batteries. My kids go through them at an amazing rate. I think that they also give them to neighborhood kids. Amazingly, as soon as I bought these, their battery usage dropped so this box will last longer than I anticipated.The Amazon Basics batteries seem to last as long as name brand, although I haven't done any scientific testing. I know that I have no problems with them in my flashlights.These are definitely at the top of my listOf things to buy from Amazon."
"We go through a lot of batteries so I started buying AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (100-Pack). I find the these batteries last as long as other name brands, so I'd rather buy this big 100 pack of batteries and save money."
Lasts as long as the name brands for a fraction of the cost. I also like the minimal packaging that is also easy to open.
These work as well as name brand version.
works fine.
I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.
Just cheap batteries.
"As advertised, works fine. Fast shipping. Have bought before and will but again."
Seem to last pretty long. Good quantity
So far so good. They last as long as expected.No problem.
Works good and price is great
Works good love the packaging and for a good price
Cheaper than other brands but work just as well. Will buy again!
Good deal!
Great batteries.
Great lasted about a month and a half running four hours a night in me led candle
Works great
works great
Works great - good product good quality
Love this battery and price is good. We always get this for my kids toys and our lanterns. Works the same as the branded ones but cheaper.
"Works great so far, only small gripe is they stink (like paint thinner). Weird yes I know, but nonetheless they work and that's all that counts!"
Works great what more can I say. Several months in the mouse so far
Works great we use them for our kids toys and remotes and other things in the house. Will definitely buy again. Last a long time.
"Update 6/16/17: Purchased product again and they are working in the devices that they did not work in prior. Also, I believe the batteries are lasting longer than the batteries I purchased prior (maybe fresher... )When they work, they work great. I have a number of 'devices' that for whatever reason, they do not power up with these batteries. I can replace with a non AmazonBasics battery and it starts working. I do not see any difference in length, circumference,etc so not sure what is going on. With that said, they work great in this devices where there is not a compatibility problem."
Cheap batteries and they work well. What more is there to say
Amazon Basics really makes some good products!
Batteries! Yeah!
"These work great and are such an amazing value!! We will continue to buy amazonBasic batteries! We have them in remote controls, electronics, kids toys, you name it they are in it and they last a good amount of time!"
"These work great. I purchased these to use in my audio recorder for my college class. It is a 4 hour class Mon-Fri and i keep it on the whole time, including the 30 min lunch break, i just pause it. These batteries have lasted much longer then the typical energizer batteries i have used for this class."
Works Great!
Exactly as described. Works great.
No complaints. Works just as good and lasts just as long as the name brands. They will give a pink bunny a run for his money.
Works just as good as other name brand batteries. I can't speak for longevity as these are used in devices that either gets used a lot or sometimes not for a week at a time. So far I would buy again.
So happy I found these batteries. Constantly replacing batteries for toys in the house. These work just as well and much cheaper
"Better price, quick delivery!"
Seem to be long-lasting. Works just great.
"Just got a large box of these home and installed them in two thermometers, a couple LED/fake candles, and a flashlight. Everything turned on like normal and appears to be functioning fine. My only concern is that these felt a little lighter than the (used up/dead) name brand batteries I was replacing, but these were much, much more affordable."
Works just like the more expensive Duracell or enigizeer batteries for a fraction of the cost. The last just as long too.
Works well for the price point and is completely comparable to name brand batteries. I will be purchasing all of my future battery needs from amazon basics.
I am so glad to have found these batteries on Amazon. They work great last as long as most popular brands with the added benefit of being much more affordable. Thank you for such a great product that's affordable. I am now able to stock up on all my batteries never be without one when I need one.
"Works perfectly, I'm interested to see how they hold up over time."
"So far, the batteries are working well but I've only had them a week so it's still way too early to tell to see how long they last. I use them in my TI-84. But, I love that the price is cheap for a small pack."
It lasted me little over 3 months on the firetv remote and I use the remote daily.
"great product, fast delivery by amazon!"
works awesome and can get them on good sales!
So far so good
"These batteries work pretty well. They don't seem to outlast Kirkland or Duracell, but they are a good value for the ."
Works well. Fairly easy too program for your specific area.
Love these batteries! Wonderful price and a great product!
"Batteries work well and last a 'normal' amount of time. I'm not a battery expert, nor did I compare different types of batteries in some type of battery experiment, but I didn't notice they died out any quicker than your average battery.... I'm satisfied!"
Worst batteries ever. I bought these and put them in the drawer till needed. I have thrown out every single one trying to find 3 that work.
WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline
"I don't even want to give this a star, worst batteries ever, lasted 15 minutes top. Do not buy"
"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money"
Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.
"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME."
"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !"
"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order."
These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.
What went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I've ever purchased. Make that the worst batteries ever purchased. I've used over half of them so far and I'm getting about 25 of the life I previously got from Duracell and other brand names.
Our experience with all Amazon batteries have been bad. They dont last nearly as long as a Duracel or Energizer. I literally replaced my computer mouse battery with an Amazon AAA battery 2 days ago and its already out. We have to replace everything that has an Amazon battery constantly. Will not buy these again.
Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.
"Worst product. Have to trash it out, because I was so upset. Did not serve the propose I bought it for."
"I will never purchase batteries online ever again! I should have never believed that this is Unique Japanese technology that enables better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures, because frankly IT DID NOT EVEN LAST FOR TWO DAYS FOR MY DIGITAL CLOCK THAT HAS FOUR PLACEMENTS OF AAA BATTERIES. At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that's that, have a good one!"
die hard Ray O Vac user but due to price I am trying these based on reviews.
Finally I have enough batteries! A nice supply of batteries that seem to last as good as any and better than many. They came in a package that was good for storing them. A very useful battery as many products use them today.
"Brought these because, I'm always forgetting to get battery's. I now find it easier to buy forgetful things from amazon. These battery's are lasting a nice amount of time. I brought it for my WII and haven't had to change the battery since I put it in. Great buy for a great product."
Batteries are perfect
Good batteries and a fantastic price.
Bargain
"Good bargain, great price and last as long as brand name batteries."
"Great batteries, last a long time. Great price and great bang for your buck!"
I've been using AmazonBasics batteries for the last few years and they have worked perfect in everything. From toys to electronics they work just fine and have solid battery life.
Price - great cheaper than box storesQuality - lasted longer in my trail cameras than any other battery i have purchased in the past 4 years
Seem to work fine I love Amazon what a great price
So far so good
"They don't hold a lot of charge, but it's a lot of AAs"
"When you have kids, you go through AA batteries like they are water. These are great and last just as long as the name brand versions."
"These are a great value and seem to last almost as long as Duracells. I would recommend them. I've had a pair in a remote for almost a year now, still going strong."
"Don't last long in my remote or the bathroom toilet light, which rarely comes on but is used every night.But then again, ALL batteries don't seem to last as long as they used to. So comparatively to Duracel, they're worth the ."
I bought an 8 pack that worked perfectly so perfect that I later bought a 20 pack. The 20 pack I had an issue with that was quickly resolved. the issue wasn't enough to deter me from buying in the future. These are really good batteries and I'll definitely be buying these again.
Function as promised!
I think these batteries last just as long if not longer than the other more expensive brands.
Great batteries for a cheap price.
Love this product. I wasn't expecting this before I bought it. It is a lot cheaper than the other product. But it's actually working pretty well.
Good deal.
Great durability and long lasting at portion of price
"These batteries are good, but do not have the power and length of service as the copper top batteries. The main benefit is that they have not leaked and ruined my electronics like the copper tops do."
"Well made and work very well, so why pay NAME BRAND prices I shall buy these again!"
"I bought these batteries mostly because I was giving gifts to my nieces and nephews and they all needed either AA or AAA batteries and buying packages separately can get really expensive. I have been using these AAA batteries in some of my own electronics and they work well. They don't have the longest life but they don't die super fast either. I can get a good amount of use from these batteries. Of course it depends on how often and how long I use the devices but I don't notice a dramatic difference between these and higher end brand name batteries. For the price, I am happy with these. I have not had any leak and none so far have been duds. I am going with 4 stars. Not the best you can buy but certainly worth the price!"
"Cheaper than others but work just as good, if not better."
great product and price
great buy
GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE
nice inexpensive batteries
Performing very well in personal grooming items. Sturdy and long lasting.
"WONDERFUL PRICE! As I buy these on the subscribe and save monthly plan. Thus the price is unbeatable. The product itself does the job just as described.LOVE THE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE monthly discount plan Amazon offers.Glad this product is available on the program. ONLY WISH THERE WERE MORE ITEMS AVAIABLE TO ADD TO THE SUB SAVE PROGRAM bc I would definitely order more!Overall this product does its job well, It is well priced due to the Sub Save program and I will continue to receive this item every 5-6months"
Exactly as described!
Great price on a great product. Affordable!!
"Great value, no issues!"
These batteries worked great! Just as good as any name brand battery but at a fraction of the cost and delivered for free!
excellent price for so many batteries. they don't discharge quickly. i'm pretty sure nothing has died yet that i put these amazon batteries in.
fantastic batteries at a reasonable price
The batteries are good.
Would like to see larger bricks of batteries 250 - 500 easier to ship to the boys overseas we can't mail the lithium so these will have to do but we need to send in larger quantities
Great Quality and good performance
Batteries work well and the price is very affordable. Would recommend and buy again in the future. Thanks for this great product Amazon!
48 batterys for only 15 Very good deal!!! Nice batterys also work perfectly.
"5 stars for value, would recommend to a friend."
Gets the job done. Wouldn't know the difference between these and name brand.
These seem to be of higher quality than name brand. Definitely worth it.
Wow these Batteries are Amazing - No Joke - and for the price... you can't go wrong - thanks Amazon.
wow what value i just found my new brand of batteries last just as long as the duresall and eneagiser
"Dude. These lights are so amazing! They are the perfect addition underneath our kitchen cabinets. I really love the remote, which allows you to not only dim the lights, but it also has a timer! The individual lights came with two small screws to install, as well as 3M tape. We used the screws for a more durable effect. The lights also came with brand new batteries in them to get you started! As an interior decorator and stager, I'll tell my clients about these. Great product!"
I received AAA batteries and have reordered AA batteries as originally ordered.
Wrong size!! Just awful. Not worth money
All those Christmas toys now work!!!YAY
"I was super excited to try these Amazon brand items and I'm sure glad they are branching out. I really just dislike Walmart and they terrible customer service. So typically I purchase batteries from BJ as I have two kids with tons of toys! Amazons prices for their batteries beats BJS by 5 to 6 depending on the size plus even at BJs you can't get a 48 pack of AA. The packaging was and simple which is fine because it does nothing for me. I must say that I like opening the package better with Amazon than normal batteries because I hate the thick plastic it's hard to cut and sometimes sharp, plus Amazons packaging is better for the environment. I just installed some batteries yesterday and I'll update as to how long they last"
Works as good or better than the Rabbit brand for less money.
"Not bad, not great. They do as their told."
So nice to have a big pack of batteries for whenever I need them. These were a great deal and way cheaper than buying them at a local store. Work and function as expected and described.
Yep
They're batteries. They make things that run on batteries work. They're cheap. They don't die after 30 minutes.
Good value and quantity for the price. Will keep buying.
good
"Best bang for buck on batteries, and always good to have a small stock of them on hand for whatever you might need.split this with my roommate, and so we now each have some AAA and we also split a pack of AA, great for the controllers that dont get used regularly, toys, remotes, whatever, if you plan ahead, it is worth it."
you always look for them and don't have them. Now I just get them every other month on auto-order
I have so many devices that require AA batteries. This was a great deal. These batteries last nearly as well as any I've ever used.
"These batteries work in all the AA devices!!11!! I'm talking Xbox 360 controllers, Xbox One controllers, Wireless Keyboards, Wireless Mouseses, TV Remotes, Xbox 360 Remotes, Xbox One Remotes. I imagine they would work on other Controllers and stuff too as long as they take AA batteries and not AAA batteries because those are smaller you know. You can take a AAA batterie though and wrap it up in aluminumun foil and itll work in a damn AA device except that the battery gets all hot in the foil and I get scared thinking it might explode on me and I feel like I hold the Controller over my damn Pecker a lot because thats just where I hold you know, and it might hurt me, you know, down there, and I need to make sure I keep it all in tact for just in case if I ever get the chance to meet a woman maybe a mexican or something i can order off the internet for less than an american girl because i dont have too much money but i'm good at xbox specifically, i never have owned a damn playstation"
All perfection as usual for Amazon
You can't beat them for the price and quantity. How many times do you need a battery and cannot find one but with this many it takes a while.
You can't beat these batteries when it comes to price. My son has seemingly a million toys that require batteries and it's always handy to have some around when he leaves them on (thomas the train motorized engines). Buying these from Amazon saves me a lot of money vice buying them from a major retailer. Thanks Amazon!Pro: cheap and reliable
This is my second time buying Amazon brand batteries. My son is an avid gamer so he eats batteries like crazy!! You can beat these batteries. They are a great price and last just as long as the name brand! I'll buy again and again!
"I don't use a lot of the AAA size, but I needed a couple -- and I wanted spares. They're top quality, and a better price than local stores (including house brands)."
you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me
You get a lot for a great price! I mainly just use them for my xbox one controller and they last for quite a long time!
"They are batteries. You get a lot for a great price. They work. Yay, batteries!"
Great batteries for an excellent price! Why pay more Free shipping with Prime. It doesn't get any better.
"At first we were completely happy with the Amazon Basics line of batteries. Reasonably priced and what we thought was good quality. Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. This is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be switching back to Duracell Procell."
"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer."
These batteries are good for the remote or other things that arent using constant power. Ive burned through a lot of these quickly with electronics that require energy for extended use. The jurys still out on whether its better to buy a smaller pack of higher quality batteries or this pack theyre both basically the same price.
Not the best.
"You can't beat the price, but I've had some of these batteries just die on me after less than a month of use."
"Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries."
"The price and packaging on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something."
"Good batteries just tested them, but there were only 98 batteries. I want my two batteries-- grr"
"I am just speechless with these batteries. They are probably the best deal for good quality batteries you will ever find. I feel like they should cost more because they are really good and last a long time. In a way, I feel like they can compete with Duracell batteries."
They worked just great!!
Great value and great product
Every bit as good as top brand name batteries. Why pay 2-3 times more This is a super deal.
Very happy with these!!
"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment."
they work. I don't know the life span or how well they work.
they are batteries. they work. who could ask for more
They are batteries: not exciting but they work.
Yup. Batteries. They work.
and they work.
Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don't fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees.
Great case to keep everything in its place! My husband love it!!!! Holds a lot of cds!
"After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice. And because you can turn the pages, you can spot the cd you want to play without the hassle of taking it from a case that is falling apart. After storing them cds, all the cases and printed covers went straight to the recycling centre. We have a small version to put those cds my husband would like to listen to whenever he must drive away for work."
"A few dollars more, but I am boycotting amazon"
"My initial impression of this was very good. The material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my Hama CD binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget CD binders.There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. By that I mean that 25 pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spine.This is where the first problem with this binder lies. Because each group of 25 pages shares the same anchor point in the spine, the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs. They bend and arch, and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film. With long-term usage I suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension. It also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages don't sit flat. It may even crack or bend your discs.I look to my Hama 120 binder to see how it *should* be done - it only has 30 pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in 3 bundles of 10. This spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tension.After just 2 weeks in storage I opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dog-eared by themselves. This is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs. Again, it is not a problem I have seen with my other disc binders, my two-year-old Hama binders look as good as new.Overally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price. If that's all you want you will probably be happy with the product. But sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder. I feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope."
Pros: Standard Echo. Cons: Older generation Echo. Other Thoughts: Arrived on time and was new in box.
"Pros: Got it for under 50, much impressive sound than 2nd gen. Has every other functionality. Cons: May be not trendy looking as newer, but still sets well on my kitchen island"
Pros: I love the Alexa series so when this one went on sale I had to get it with a camera. Now I can watch my security cameras from my couch or even drop in and see whats going on in other places. The audio is nice and loud and the picture is clear Cons: I wish I could stop the screen from turning off I keep thinking its unplugged but its saving power I guess
"ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SCREEN IS SMALL, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE DEVICE. FOR THOSE THAT PREFER A LARGER SCREEN, THE ECHO SHOW WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE."
"I wasn't sure I even wanted this item, but caught up in all the excitement surrounding the Alexa enabled devices. Well....after getting it home I became addicted and ordered two Echos for the entertainment stand and today I have to Sub coming. I can't say enough for the product as well as the quick service/pick up at the Target store. Great service and product!"
"Pros: Works good like Alexia Cons: setting it up is a , HASLE had to call verizon three times Other Thoughts: I WOULD RECOMMEND IT"
"Pros: Relatively easy to setup and works quite reliably. Cons: The mirror cast function didn't seem to work well displaying video while it was steaming to a Windows 10 laptop. Other Thoughts: This product was recommended to me by a coworker and I was skeptical at first, but the product has turned out to be what I now rely on for most of my entertainment access."
"Pros: I WOULD recommend anyone who was going to purchase anything , newegg is the BEST PLACE TO LOOK ! Cons: No compaints"
"Pros: Allows you to cut your cable. With many apps to download and many apps that allow you free use of services such as streaming as long as you have a Cable provided (at least for the internet), you can log in and stream. You can use apps like Kodi and TubiTV to watch many shows. My favorite is TubiTV. Yes, there are commercials but not as many as other services.Buy this, check it out, enjoy your freedom from cable TV! Cons: Don't really have any complaints."
"Pros: I'm a subscriber to DirectTV Now! So i pay a yearly discount and get over 450+ channels streamed to my TV for 59 a month, I pay for Prime/Netflix. combined, My cable bill was 172.00 I get more choices options, and I got the components to run it off ethernet, so no lag.I have un-metered fiber optic, so I can stream a lot, given how my family is good at leaving it running. Cons: TV's in which HDMI ports don't extend out make this difficult to install, My 4K TV has side ports took me like 4 minutes. Wireless is pointless and get the ethernet addon"
Pros: Very satisfied I am about buy online this side wonderful service good Quality seal pack and good packing Cons: Great Other Thoughts: I am satisfied thanks
Bulk is always the less expensive way to go for products like these
Doesn't seem to last as long in some devices as other brands but good for the cost.
ive not had any problame with these batteries have ordered them in the past been very pleased.
Well if you are looking for cheap non-rechargeable batteries that last quite a while then these are perfect. Nothing more to say.
The battery life is much poorer compared to name brands like energizer and Duracell.
These don't last as long as name brand of batteries like Duracell or energizer. They are cheaper but I'd rather pay a little bit more and have them last a lot longer.
I am not a fan of off-brand batteries and so far have been disappointed by off-brand battery performance. I have decided to give these batteries a try and thus far they have performed as expected. At this time I have a number of Amazon batteries because they are low cost.
"just got em so I can't really comment on how good the do the job, good price, quick delivery but have only put two into one of my keyboards but they can go up to a year so who can say after three days"
we have many things that need aa battery they are great
This my second order and they seem to work as good as name brand and ship to my door.
This was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great. Just as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price. This will be the only way I purchase batteries from now on!
"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"
I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks. On an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again.
I use them for my Xbox controllers and they last pretty long. Great for a cheap price.
3 of them exploted and damage my charger that I bought here what is going to happen with my charger not satisfied with the batteries
"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity."
The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.
"At first, i was not sure and going to get the name brand batteries, Then i was like, let me just give them a try, its made by Amazon so i must be good. When i got them i was very happy because they are Great batteries. Last very long time, the big plus is the price . You get a great product for a low price."
Excellent
Good deal on a great product!
great value
"AmazonBasics AA batteries save me a lot of time and money going to the store and buying them pack by pack, it is very cost efficient to but these for my budget friendly family of 5.I love that this is a big pack of batteries, 20 in all making the price drop down to about .38 cents a battery. I use these in everyday things from remotes, to flash lights. They work just as good as the more expensive batteries saving me lots of cash.I turn to the AmazonBasics brand when it comes to all of my office needs. I can't complain about any of their products I bought so far. Now it's time to buy a big pack of AAA batteries from AmazonBasics. I highly recommend these batteries to anyone out there looking to buy a great quality pack of batteries. These are great for products that have a highly running life like babies products or toys. They defiantly can keep up with my family without wasting ton of money."
"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"

A battery is a battery these work just as good if not better than the name brands like Duracell or Enginzer
"Great batteries at a very reasonable price. I haven't one any extensive scientific research on them, but am sure they'll rate well with the top brands. AmazonBasics products in general are quite good."
Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.
Got it and it's already in use.
I bought the smaller pack last time and didn't realize how quickly it runs out. Very happy with this amount of batteries.
Good deal for rechargeable. They all work and seem to preform well.
Can't get too jazzed about inexpensive batteries -just a good deal all around.
"Nothing beats being able to buy electrical/electronic power sources from a vendor large enough to sell self-branded goods at reasonable prices relative to brand name product. So far I have had satisfactory results with these batteries, and I expect I will continue to purchase them in the future."
"a good stock pile of batteries for a decent price. do not last as long as the 'name brands' but for the money, they are ok"
Works great for everyday AA battery needs
"I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack. The price was right and the batteries are working very well. This is really a bargain."
I love amazons batteries. Always there to save the day. I use subscribe and save to make sure my kids are never without batteries. It helps so much.
"A great deal, and the batteries have a good life to them. I will buy again when I start running low."
"All I buy now is AmazonBasics when it comes to batteries. They are long lasting and a great price. I have tried the AA, AAA, and 9-volt. As a cheap shopper, I am pleased with their performance and price."
"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these."
"The most batteries for the lowest price. I have not comprehensively tested these for longevity, but like the ferocious Zerg, their sheer numbers can dominate other units."
"A lot of batteries for a great price, i bet you will never see that at a supermarket! Thank you AmazonBasics!"
I happen to have remote controls in our house and this item certainly is a must in my living room.
"You know you need them, so why not get a bunch. I'm the battery guy for the kids toys, so I have to keep them on hand at all times!"
"Worked exactly as they are supposed to, good price, good quality. lasting a nice long time, A good buy."
"A good deal, well packed in reusable package"
Seem to work fone for a fraction of the price!
"So far, so good. Great bundle for a good price."
A+
great batteries at a great price. I ordered them and they arrived the next day too!
These batteries are as good or better than any brand of alkaline battery on the market today.
A+A+A+A+A+ FAST DELIVERY JUST AS DESCRIBE
A great deal for the price. Let's hope these alkaline last longer.
Switched form Costco batteries to these Amazon battery. AA and AAA are great. Unfortunately 9V is off from the standard size.
Came fast. Great price. Seems to last as long as expensive batteries.
Good batteries for a good price. Will be buying more when I run out.
"So far I have had no complaints with these batteries. I was hesitate at first because they were cheaper than your big name brands. I figured they may not last long. But I was proven wrong. They have lasted just as long as the big name brands, and they are a lot cheaper. I buy these for work and for home. They do not disappoint me at either place."
Great Value!
Batteries. Gotta have them
Another great offer from Amazon that delivers perfarmance and price for your electronic agenda 1
"Great deal, better than local stores"
"These batteries are a lot better than i thought they were going to be. Some of them actually lasted longer than your name brand batteries such as Duracell Energizer. I will definitely be ordering these again in the future. This was my first time buying this many batteries once and i was never let down. Arrived on time, with no problems."
"clean design, good power"
Back up for my motion sensor lights
The price was good and so far the batteries I have used work fine. I do not have a battery tester nor the time (if I had a battery tester) to test each and every battery as others have done. I am just going to believe that they will all work just fine.
Great buy and excellent batteries but I ordered this size in error. I returned and received and immediate credit.
"As advertised, I have not had any problems."
Good value for the money Will order again
great batteries
Very nice packaging. Good batteries.
These don't last long at all.
Mistakenly bought these thinking they were a better quality of their rechargeable batteries. They actually do better in my electric toothbrush than Energizer. It's faster and they last longer. Definitely my battery of choice where rechargeable batteries won't do. Glad I accidentally bought them. Lol
Works great. Just as Amazon advertised.
"So far so good have to wait and seen how they last, so will update later."
Almost all used up. Very handy having batteries when products arrived.
The only thing cuter than a AA battery is the AAA battery. These come neatly wrapped in individual packs inside a long skinny box that makes you wonder why you didn't purchase AmazonBasics a long time ago. Save yourself the money of Duracell and Energizer and just go with the flow.
They Work! Also lasts a good amount of time!
Seems to last just as long as the name brands batteries for much less money. Also like the easy-open packages.
"Just as good as name brands, lasts longer and no mercury."
"Love these, never had any problems and you can not beet the price! I not only buy them for home but also for my job."
I'm going to have enough batteries until Jesus returns and then actually after when I'm left behind. Great bargain.
I don't think I'll ever buy duracell again
"AMAZING DEAL!!!So many batteries for an amazing price!!! In the stores, you get half the amount of batteries for double the price.100 will re buy.work great. FAST SHIPPING TO! (ONLY TOOK A DAY)"
I have truly been converted form any other battery brand to using AmazonBasics! Very happy with the life of these batteries!
"You put these little cylinders in stuff and it makes them work -- flashlights, remotes, kitchen scales, clocks."
Amazon basics AA batteries are satisfactory for the cost. Being Alkaline the seem to work fine in most things.
When in ordered there batteries I was not sure what to expect. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I tested each and everyone one for voltage which was 1.61V and made in Indonesia. The last batteries I purchased were Energizer's Industrial grade which also carried the same 1.61 volts. The expiration date on these Amazon basics AAA's is 2027 so I expect them to have a good shelf life I believe these batteries will perform every bit as well as the energizers I last purchased. I took advantage of the snail mail delivery I received a 5 Amazon credit which made this deal even better. From the reviews I've read I would highly recommend purchasing these batteries over any name brand for General use purposes as I'm not sure how they would stand up too I drain situations. But I will get back to you on that one with my next purchase.
"I use these batteries mainly for wireless mouse and kid toys and I gotta say I'm very satisfied, they perform the same as any other battery manufacturer I have tried in the past. Highly recommend it!"
2AA batteries are good quality and last as long as the name brands
"Multiply pack of AAA batteries! Amazon brand of AAA batteries in a pack of 36, great value, great price!"
"I buy these in bulk for kids toys and for the 20 LED flashlights i have scattered around my house and car. Good value, and I like that they are available in large quantities."
I started buying these large packs of Amazon batteries because of the great value and previous experience with Amazon Basic products. These batteries seem to work as well as my Energizers and Duracells at a fraction of the cost. I will be buying more AA and AAA when I run low. That should take a while with this large pack.
Work great and are a great price. Can't beat that! These seem to be on par with low to mid tier brand battery live so can't complain.
Batteries seems to last as long as top brand names and the price is phenomenal. I use a lot of the Amazon Basics product s and have been happy with all of them.
"This is a great buy and last along time, Amazon Basics is great ."
Don't waste your coin of the expensive store brands. These work great.
OK
These batteries are ok for the price. They don't last very long in a device compared to other brand name batteries. There is a difference! I wouldn't buy them again.
Works great and holds chaege as well as and battery I have had
"Great price, and I'm very pleased with performance."
I love these batteries. Affordable and have worked well in all our game console controllers and kids toys that are frequently used!
Amazon batteries are an excellent deal. Good battery life and a very reasonable price. It seems crazy to me that I used to purchase batteries at the store after having bought the large packs for cheap on amazon.
GREAT!
"First of all- buying batteries is never fun . It's also quite expensive. I fell in love with the fact , I could buy these Amazon branded batteries through prime and get them in two days .But guess what. I got them in 1 day!!! Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive."
WORST batteries EVER. I thought there would be no appreciable difference between these and Duracell. I was wrong. Mouse was VERY sluggish and would sometimes stop working with these batteries. Replacing them with another set of these batteries did not help. My husband thought the computer had a virus. Problem SOLVED with Duracell. I will not be purchasing these batteries again. Amazon FAIL.
"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other brands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer."
Perfectly sent perfectly usable
"I just love Amazon's batteries. They last just as long as the name brand batteries, but are much less expensive."
"Arrived quickly,great price seem to be high quality so far"
"Everything we have around the house uses batteries, so we go through them fast. I like purchasing in bulk because I don't have to purchase them as often and they are a little cheaper that way. I was a little nervous to purchase the AmazonBasics brand, because I wanted to make sure that I purchased a quality battery. We normally purchase Duracell.I am happy to see that the quality is just as good as the other brands we've purchase and at a fraction of the cost.We will be purchasing these again in the future."
I thought I would give these AA batteries a try. I have always used Kirkland brand and never had a problem. These are a few cents cheaper. I will see how long they last compared to Kirkland brand (Costco).
Battery purchases don't get any better than this. The price made me curious as to the quality of purchasing Amazon Brand Batteries over any of the major brands. I have been very happy with the quality and the price just cannot be beat. Would definitely purchase again.
Great price. Great packaging. Great Great Great!
So far batteries seem to be working fine. Will buy again.
Great price! Just began using these batteries so their lasting ability is yet to be determined. DFD
"Love the AmazonBasics AA Batteries. Also bought the AmazonBasics D Cell batteries previously. Getting just as good life out of them, if not better, than the two major name brand batteries. Highly recommend these batteries either in AA or D cell. Will buy again...."
These were exactly as described arrived on time (or maybe earlier than the delivery date specified). They work just fine I'd buy them again. And the BIG plus is they were a LOT less expensive than buying them from a brick mortar store work just as well! No problems :)
They work. What more could I say.
I tested the lifespan of these batteries with my Wireless mouse. Lasts just as long as Duracell CopperTop AAA.
no point in spending money on brand name batteries. these are a great product at a very reasonable price. i don't buy any other brands.
These AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries are actually AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries and work as such. Unbelievable.
Great product!
VERY SATISFIED ....
I just put 4 of these in my flashlight they worked. It is too soon to see how long they will last. I have had great experience with other amazon basics products ( the wireless keyboard mouse set)So I decided to try the batteries-- so far so good
AmazonBasics are the BEST batteries I have ever purchased! They last WAY longer than any others and I love the price!
"No issues with these batteries. I've started buying all of my batteries from AmazonBasics, especially the AmazonBasics C Cell Everyday Alkaline Batteries (12-Pack) for the holidays and AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack) for everyday items.Bottom line: I would recommend this to a friend."
These are great. I used to have to go to Costco to get the equivalent number of batteries at a discount. Now I can get these batteries in a couple of days from Amazon.
"Amazing Value, they shipped free on Amazon Prime and they are as good as any other."
"made my day or as life goes on, I won't have to worry about batteries. and at a good price."
"The only way to buy batteries. Large quantity, and great price."
"First time I've ever purchased Amazon Basic batteries, and I am quite pleased with how long they last!"
"Ordering in bulk for batteries makes my life so much easier. I have kids, and they always need a battery for something! I have AAA, AA and other sizes on hand all the time, and I love never disappointing them! They have tons of battery operated toys and games and Amazon makes it so much easier than running out to the corner store and paying double!"
"Yep, they work! And it is nice to know I have backups."
"They are batteries, they power the remotes, kids toys, flashlights, and the thermostat and are doing a good enough job of it"
Works great with all of our devices. Seem to be good quality and last as long as the major battery brands. Will definitely purchase again
I was looking for an alternative to the forever leaking Rayovacs. So far so good. They seem to work well.
"great price, very good batteries"
AOK-AS ORDERED
"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again."
arrived and worked like a charm!!
"Arrived on time and exactly as described, OK, Amazon has me hooked on some of their Basic lines of products. Great deal for what you get. Have ordered before and very pleased with the performance."
Product as advertised. Arrived on time and in good condition. Good value! Will buy again.
"As expected from Amazon, there were no problems with the ordering and delivery process. So far I have installed several batteries, but it's too soon to tell how long they are going to last."
GREAT VALUE
The Amazon batteries seems to have an acceptably long life compared to much more expensive brand names. My one complaint is that they recently upsized the box the smaller package was much more convenient to store the batteries in.
you can't go wrong with this. quality is as good as brand name products.
These batteries are just as good as the name brands like duracell or energizer that I normally would purchase. I have a wireless keyboard that takes AAA batteries and I've noticed that these batteries last just as long as the other brands mentioned above. Save your money and purchase these.
"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review."
Have had zero issues with longevity or voltage. As good as the major brand batteries
"People kept saying, They're as good as Duracell but I didn't believe it until I tried them myself."
"As a Mom of 3 young kids, we go through batteries very quick! I've tried all types of batteries from name brand, to various store brands. Amazon compares to the top brands I've used, and in fact I would consider it a top brand. They last twice as long in my son's wireless PlayStation controllers than the Toys R Us brand we were previously using. You can't beat the price for the quality and I will only buy Amazon batteries from now on!"
"I have used these batteries for several years. As good, if not better than any other top name brand."
"Price per battery is great. I checked the voltage on some of them and they were all at 1.6V. I think they will last at least as long as the brand name batteries, although I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn they are all made by the same people and just labeled differently."
Great !!!A lot of batteries.Last long and don't leak.
Lotta batteries. at a good price.
These were OK. I don't think I'll but them in the future. I prefer Energizers.
I am disappointed in length of battery life.
Works with everything and has good battery life.
Great size pack of batteries for a great price! Thank you!
"Awesome little batteries for flashlights, remote controls etc. They always have the greatest deals on Amazon and Amazon prime especially. I love the fact that you can get batteries at an awesome price in a hurry when store prices are ridiculous."
Amazon Basics - you are my hero. These are great batteries. I use them in my Apple keyboard and mouse and they have outlasted the brandname batteries I used to use. I get on average an additional 1-2 weeks of use out of each set of batteries which is an additional money saver. The shelf life seems to be normal for alkaline batteries.The packaging is biodegradable which adds to the convenience and value.
"Bye bye big name, expensive batteries!! Holy moly! I never knew that Amazon sold batteries. In all the years I've been shopping here! I came across these while searching for batteries to use with my son's toys (they all take a ton) as well as for use in products around the house. I took a look at the reviews and decided they were definitely worth trying out! Of course I used my Prime shipping and they arrived in 2 days. Once they arrived we put 3 in my son's toy train and BAM! off it took with speed! Even my son said wow, the train is going faster than ever haha! I'm currently using these in his toys, the wall clock, the meat thermometer and many other items! I certainly recommend these batteries. They came packaged nicely in groups of 4, tucked into a cute little cardboard box. At a fraction of the cost of the big name batteries and they work JUST AS WELL if not BETTER!"
"I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. Other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it."
These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
I love these batteries. I am so happy that I bought them. Batteries are super expensive at my local retailer. It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me. I hope you found this information useful to you and thank you for reading.If you found this information helpful please click Yes on the link below. I greatly appreciate it.
awesome batteries. Work just as good as energizer or Duracell and a cheaper price. worth the purchase.
Great for the price
"Super value for alkaline batteries!!!,heck even for normal non alkaline batteries this would be a great deal"
"Awesome price, awesome batteries. I will never buy batteries anywhere else again, this deal is hard to beat."
"Awesome price, especially on Subscribe Save. Haven't had much chance to use them (that takes a while with batteries), so no issues as yet."
Never spending a small fortune on other brands! Work great!
"Awesome value for the price, works great."
"They work, great value"
Boom-Shacka-Lacka-Lacka! Great price!
"We love these batteries! Better pricing than the bigger brands, but work just as well and just as long! Go Amazon!"
Awesome..great deal!!
Died after 5 uses in my coffee frother wand. Won't buy again.
They for really fast
These are bad batteries with very short life. I returned my first order assuming that I got a bad batch (despite the expiration date years away). Started using the replacement order in late May and already have to replace the batteries.I love Amazon Basics products and Amazon service but this product is a big dud. This is the first negative review I've ever written about a product on Amazon.
Wrong item.
These batteries are bad. In any device the last only a very short time.
Many of the batteries are no good.
Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.
"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again."
It states that the batteries last a while. But I use them for my TV remotes. And I ended up buying Energizer a few days later. They do not last. I changed batteries twice the day I got them in mail.The triple A were no better.
"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.
"Bargain, inexpensive"
Great batteries at a great value.
"I used these batteries in one of my game cameras, but the life of theAmazon Basic battery did not last as long compared to name brand batteries. I really don't believe they are worth the savings when the Basics probably didn't take half the pictures in the game camera as Duracell. I will use these batteries in remote and my kids toys."
"Using my el cheapo multimeter (Fluke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerance for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available."
Nice cheap batteries. A lot of them for the price . Will buy again in like 2 years lol
Always need batteries and these come at a great price.
As expected
Batteries
Batteries work great!
Didn't seem to last as long as the standard USA name brands
Good price and good batteries
great value. I will purchase again.
Long lasting and no leakage
Such a great value!!!
These are great. the price is amazing. We go through so many batteries. Love having so many and will buy again when we run out
"THESE DOUBLE AA BATTERIES ARE SOME MYSTICAL STUFF RIGHT HERE, THEY WILL LIGHT UP YOUR FLASHLIGHT (as long as it uses these) ALL THROUGHOUT THE YEARS!!!!"
"They are batteries, what can I say. Bought as gifts to go along with the candles."
They are batteries... They do last a while though in the R/C toys we got for x-mas. I would buy these again over more expensive name brands.
They're batteries. They work. Simple as that.
Work
Works like they should.
Batteries are awesome!! They are cost effective and last just as long as Energizer or Duracell. I have used these in both low drain (toys and small electronics) as well as high drain devices (Cameras and high powered LED flashlights). Using the Subscribe and Save makes them even more cost effective.
So far so good
Batteries are larger than normal and do not fit my audio gear or guitars... if you need these for sound or audio I'd pass...
"Batteries are very good, but packaging is horrendous, which is surprising because usually Amazon does a great job with hassle free packaging, but every four bats are packaged in tough plastic. Would have been better to just place the lot of bats in a simple box without the individual plastic wrap. Will not buy again with this packaging."
"I use these in my wireless mouse and a radio. I have not had to use them in my mouse yet. I have used 4 of them in one of my radios. The radio is still going strong after approximately 8 hours of play in the park and elsewhere. By the way, my radio is a small one, not a big boombox. If that makes a difference."
"Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap"
Batteries came on time with no issues. Not expecting much out of them seeing how they are basic but should work. You get alot for a decent price.
"They're normal batteries, I just love that I could order them online and have them shipped with the wireless mouse I ordered the same day and have them arrive at the same time!"
These do not last at all. I have a very mini desk fan that takes 4 AA and they need to be changed every other day.
These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.
"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand."
This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.
Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again
stock up for christmas!these last pretty much the same as the name brands.
Perfect! Thank you
Do you have battery-operated items Do you need AA batteries to power your items These AA batteries will power your items.
What's to say They're batteries and they're from Amazon. Just another staple item you'll need at a great price. Why shop anywhere else
Great batteries that batterize your battery needing lifestyle.
I don't think I will ever go back to Costco to buy batteries. The price is awesome for the quantity and they last just as long as name brand batteries.
2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.
I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China
Came as advertised. Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great. Even the paging they sent it in was greatPlease Vote YES on my review!! Thank you
Great product...they seem to last just as long as other batteries that cost twice as much!
Difficult to be excited about AA batteries but everything about the purchase was as advertised. They were well packaged and even arrived several days early. They are working well. My regret is that I did not order AAA batteries at the same time.
These are working very well for us and they are economical to use-which we do a lot of.
"These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. We also ordered AmazonBasics AA batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box."
Batteries were packaged good and seem fine
We like them
"We have been using these batteries in some kids toys and they work fine. I haven't noticed them lasting longer or shorter than others. We normally purchase the Kirkland brand one from Costco, and these appear to be equivalent. Its great to have a large supply of batteries on hand when you have kids!"
Batteries work fine and are less expensive then all of the others on Amazon for sell. Nothing more to say!
"These work great! First time I ordered them, but they were a great price. I love ordering from Amazon and hate getting out of the house so I will continue to order these."
Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.
"Work well for the most part. One pack had defective batteries, but the rest so far have been fine. Last decently long."
"Batteries! So far no problem with any I've received, they do the job!"
"Average batteries, functioning as expected, at a great price. I think I'll see if they've got some AA's at a comparable price."
They're batteries. Excellent.
As expected
"They're batteries, they work. I'll post about it I see they don't last very long, but I've gained a lot of trust in Amazon brand products so I'm fairly confident."
Good batteries for cheap!
they are batteries...what more can be said How long do they last who knows just got them.
good value
Everything was fine except a few of the batteries brand new out of the pack I purchased a couple weeks prior were corroded with battery acid seeping out.
Batteries did not last anywhere near the length of the Duracell that we purchased. Did a side by side test and the Amazon batteries were down to 50 to where the Duracell batteries were still at 99. Will do some more testing to make sure the test were equal. We bought two new trail cameras and we put one set of Amazon's batteries in one camera and one set of the duracell batteries in the other. We will now switch the batteries in the cameras for the same time frame and see what the end result is.
Some of the unused batteries stored in AC room show signs of deterioration within six months of purchase. Poor battery performance
"Trust Amazon Basics products. Work like the top name brand products, but at a greatly reduced price. Use these in my bike lights."
"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat."
"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. At first I has hesitant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong...."
Battery replenishment
great price
"Beautiful batteriesI put 3 of them in the Trimmer, it run like brand newI haven't heard its motor sound so powerful in more than a year"
"Gave these batteries a shot, because we've had great luck with AmazonBasics products. I just purchased the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. These batteries do not last. I have a flashlight that uses 4 AAA batteries, and have gone through 8 batteries in a one week span. These die very quickly. I have had a similar experience with the AA batteries on a wireless Mac keyboard. Would not recommend these batteries."
"i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 aa battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thru for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-26really good product"
Great batteries for a awesome price. Could not ask for more.
Great price and works fantastic
These batteries have a lot of power.My calculate acts like its on steroids.
Best Battery Deal! They last as long as Duracell and Energizer!
"These test full charge while the ones i have been buying are already partially discharged bc u cannot tell how fresh they r, even when they are adv as good for 10 yrs."
"Another great product from amazon. I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used. When it comes to any common battery size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), I will only be using AmazonBasics. Give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. You can't beat the price and/or quality."
"great price for a quality product they last a long time and are useful, the package they come in is an excellent and convenient storage case that doesnt take up much space"
great deal
Love the price... now I never run out of batteries... and they last just a long as other batteries I have purchased.
"I go through a lot of double AA for my Xbox controller. I can't tell a difference with these compared to any brand. For the price, I'll stick with these."
This is an amazing value. Very good batteries. Get some and stock up!
"I have a 2 year old son who has plenty of toys that eat through batteries quickly, so I decided to try out this big pack. The batteries last a long time for low power items like tv remotes and audible toys. They run out of charge after a few days on my son's most used toy, a bubble machine. But, he does use it for long periods of time when he plays with it and it has a high power motor. I would say that higher prices batteries last a little longer with his high power toys, but the cheap price for these males up for that. I just added these to our subscription list and will buy the AAA of this brand when I need them."
"These batteries are the bomb. They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price. They shipped super fast and there are so many that I still have some lying around from my order last year. Definitely will re-order when I run out. :)"
Would buy them again
Best value ever! I have a toddler and almost all of his toys are AAA and these were a life saver! Thank god for AMAZON!
"It seemed like everything I bought for my daughter required 12 batteries a piece! This is a great value. Now all her swings, bouncers, and toys are fully operational. I've purchased this size and others. No issues and will buy all my batteries from Amazon from now on."
"Such a great deal, this is a life saver! I am set for life(or at least for a few months)..I go through these like no other with my new automatic trash can"
It's probably the best value for AA batteries out there. They function as expected.
Amazon never lets me down. These batteries are a great value. Cheaper than Sams club batteries and these are shipped to my house for free with Prime. They seem to last just as long as energizer batteries. They come packaged in a nice box and are wrapped in plastic. For all the toys we have that take batteries these are great.
I mainly use these in my xbox one cobtroller. I get an average of 2hrs longer life span compared to Duracell and for a fraction of the cost.
they wear out to quickly. won't buy again. better off buying Duracell.
Seems to be equal to any other brand of batteries I have used.
decent quality battery strength for price. better than dollar store for sure
"I used to use Duracells all the time, and then started having leakage problems with them. I ventured out to try these. Life seems to be as long in devices I use a lot, and they don't leak. I am done with Duracell, and will use these!"
Arrived on time and works perfectly. Did not need this many but it was such a good price I couldn't pass it up.
These batteries perform better than expected. I was very impressed.
"These batteries are lasting as long as my more expensive batteries. I bought them because I needed them for Christmas but, I will get these from now on."
"Medical setting. Better than I thought they would be...Yes, perfect."
I am highly satisfied with these batteries. I mainly use them with Bose noise cancelling headphones and haven't experienced any issues. They last longer than most batteries I have purchases and are much cheaper than competitor brands. A well deserved 5 star rating!
Batteries have great life span. Highly recommend. They last just as long if not longer than the top name brands at a much cheaper cost.
I personally think that these batteries are as good as name brand ones for half the price! I primarily use these in my xbox one controllers and change batteries maybe twice a month of heavy play. Definitely worth the purchase!
I have used these for a while. I went thru a whole box but have not had to replace them yet in anything. Much better than the store brands at the large hardware chains.
"I've been buying these for a couple of years. Totally indistinguishable from the expensive ones you get in the store. Great value. Never had an issue. Best bit is the packaging - it's an actual box you can close so you don't have batteries loose all around the place shorting themselves out. Also, they shrink wrap them in fours which add to the longevity of them."
And I mean that as a compliment lol! I'm actually a long time user of the Sunbeam batteries from my local dollar store. I didn't feel like going out to get more of them this time so I ordered these instead. Looks like those will be my last dollar store batteries cause the AmazonBasics rock! I get the convenience of home delivery and they last about twenty percent longer. Thanks for a great product at a fantastic price Amazon.
"I bought a big pack of the AAA batteries, but really didn't put them through the test until Hurricane Matthew. They worked awesome. Never had to change batteries in the lanterns after 5 days of heavy use (8-9 hours a day). Worked great in my son's toys, our remote controls, just everything. I know what brand I will buy from now on! Great job Amazon."
"I have to admit these batteries work better than the name brand batteries. I rarely have to replace these batteries unless i'm using a remote control car or something that takes a lot of power. And for the price, you can't lose."
Better than the other brand names and definitely last longer in most applications. We buy and use them regularly and test them in our kids toys to make sure they stay at the top of their game and our expectations. Highly recommend.
"No joke, i was such a skeptic of these batteries. Seriously. But they seem more powerful than the name brand competition.I bought them for use in a breast pump mainly. I noticed with other batteries I was getting a lot less suction but with these it runs full power, just like I'd plugged it in the wall.I don't think I'll buy the name brand batteries anymore. Good job Amazon."
"Long lasting and a great value! Come in very basic packaging, most likely to cut cost. Will buy again!"
tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands.
Low quality batteries - they die after using a few times. Better to go with big brand name
"Just as good as Duracell, if not better. Do you beg to differ Here is an experiment to conduct for a school child. Use a Duracell and an Amazon to light up two light bulbs and see how long each one stays lit. Then divide: (hours lit)/(cost of battery) and see which one is the better value. I already changed out one Amazon AA in my wireless mouse and another 2 AA batteries in my wireless weather station. The mouse Amazon AA lasted about a month and a half and the weather station is still running after 3 weeks. The batteries came wrapped in packs of 4."
"batteries are stupid expensive in the store. Everything seems to take AA batteries now (remotes, video game controllers, kids toys, etc), so buy in bulk online and save."
"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch."
"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!"
"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basics products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks. So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapper can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basics as they become available."
Works just fine in my Xbox One controller. I replaced the batteries a few weeks ago and they're still fine.
"These perform and last just as well as Energizer or Duracell. We burn through these at my office for wireless keyboards and mice, so I needed to restock at a good price. I've never had any complaints by anything made by AmazonBasics at all. These come in a simple cardboard box that's sealed. Inside that box, you have two rows of sealed/wrapped batteries. They worked great for my needs, and will return based on the price."
"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture."
"Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received"
The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
"I've had my Thea for three months so far and it is amazing except for some recent issues. The problem is now it's breaking (after only three months) and I have no clue why. It won't charge anymore and it isn't vibrating on full power. I'm hoping that Nymph will send me a replacement considering the lifetime guarantee. I'm kind of upset at how fast it broke though, despite how good of a condition I tried to keep it in."
"For running on batteries, this light is super bright and works awesome. I have these all over my house and thwy work great. Easy to install and has a pretty decent battery life."
I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.
"Work as well as major brands, as far as I can tell, but for a much better price."
"Obviously I have not tried all of the batteries in this pack, but now we are about half way through the pack and all of them have worked great and I have not had to replace any of them."
"Decent batteries, I find they die a little quicker than others, but still fine for the price"
"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these"
"Capacity is a little light on these, but the price is awesome."
"I don't know if these last any longer or shorter than other brands, but the price is good so we'll see how it goes over time."
"I use them for Xbox one controllers, 2 batteries last maybe 2 weeks in my controller, but you get a good amount in the box. Might just look into rechargeable batteries. Tv remotes last longer obviously. 48 batteries for 12 was an easy sell though for me"
I don't know how these batteries got such great reviews. They don't last nearly as long as the brand name batteries. Don't buy these unless you want to change batteries in your kids' toys and remote controls all the time. I'm super loyal to Amazon...but not with this product.
great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it
"These are low powered, don't last long even in tv remite you arelucky to get a week out of them. Energizer s last a year usually. Don't wasteyour money."
Not good. Don't last a week.
I find they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell.
"These batteries all had a charge of 1.61 volts when i received them,much more than the duracel brand. The exp. date on them is 12/2026. i would buy these again.....Can't go wrong with AMAZON !!!! They always please,one way or another ......"
"Great battery, last just as long, great price"
Love these batteries! Cheap and every bit as good as the big brands!
"I bought the large box because I use a lot of batteries and also purchased the set of four Everyday Essentials LED lanterns. Now, I will be prepared the next time the power goes off. What's to say about batteries I trusted Amazon contracted with a good battery manufacturer to produce them and carry their brand name. At about 25 cents each, you cannot do better."
Awesome purchase. Last a pretty long time!
they are fresh batteries and work great
Good batteries at a cheap price.
Great batteries for super price! I am on recurring shipment - get a box once a month.
Long lasting and great packaging. Rechargeable is best but these are good in a pinch.
"These are a fabulous deal, and oh so convenient, especially for baby toys, smoke alarms, and other gadgets."
You cannot beat this price for how many batteries you get! I will be ordering these again!
"I've usually had very good experiences buying AmazonBasics branded items. I've found them to very comparable to the top brand names. These batteries are the exception. Quality wise, they are more comparable to Rayovac batteries than Duracell or Energizer."
A real pleasure.
I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!
"love amazon batteries..great quality, great price"
"You cannot beat the quality for the price of these batteries. For the same price as the cheapo brands, these AmazonBasics batteries are great quality. Nice weight to them compared to the cheap Sony or Sunbeam batteries. Performance wise they have been good so far and been using about a dozen of them for a month now."
"Honestly, they are AAA batteries. I had a keyboard that only takes AAA and don't have rechargeable ones. So far, haven't had an issue. Whether or not they last as long as name brand is yet to be seen. But the fact that I bought these already a few months ago and I'm currently typing on said keyboard with the first set I took from package tells me they should last long enough."
"They are Super , had them in my outdoor weather station sensors for 10 months and in with all types of weather conditions and they are still working !!!!!!!!!"
"Great deal on these batteries. They are a quality product! I'm not sure why anyone would spend more just to get a more recognized name brand. These AmazonBasics are great, last as long as the big name brands, and I like the way they come packed, too."
Great batteries and a really good price. So far I have been very impressed with the value you get when you buy any AmazonBasics item.
"I bought a box of batteries to use in birthday and Christmas presents for the kids. You would never know these weren't big name batteries. They last just as long as the ones you'd buy at big box store, but cost so much less. I haven't used any yet that seemed to die long before they should have.The batteries come in a slim cardboard box which is easy for storing. My only complaint is that they are plastic wrapped in sets of 4 inside the cardboard. While this does make it easy if I have to grab some to take with me, it seems a tad environmentally unfriendly and the plastic is tightly wrapped, making it hard to open."
"Got the juice, delivered right to the house, not a dud in the box."
AmazonBasics never disappoints. These are good quality batteries at a much better price compared to Duracell which I think these are comparable too. A great deal for this HUGE pack!
These batteries are top quality and you can't beat the price. If your in the market for batts then amazon basics are for you.
Great option for all the little doo-dads and junk that doesn't need much power. I use these in TV remotes and such.
"It's batteries, you've used them. I keep these in my desk drawer specifically for my wireless Xbox 360 controller. Great price for the quantity, will be buying again in the future."
Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.
The few batteries I have used so far work and are holding up. Will update if they fail prematurely
"I've been ordering these cheap batteries for years for my XBOX controllers. They are cheap and long lasting, and I'll never go back to picking up batteries at the store again."
cheap and work gritty good
Well this is my second order of batteries thru Amazon and both the energizer and these are not as good as the ones from the store
"Batteries die quicker than Dollar store batteries. Used these batteries on various products -toothbrush, computer mouse, camera flash, etc. Batteries at best lasted half as much compared to Energizer and Duracell. Would not recommend!"
"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them."
cheap battery power but they don't last well
"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does."
Works just as well as any other batteries just much cheaper!
"I love the package they came in, it makes it easy to store the extras."
These batteries leak easily and I found them hard to insert into a toy that required AAA. Did not have this problem when I switched them with brand name batteries.
"Don't last as long as Duracell, but you can't beat the price"
"Cheap, long lasting batteries. Can't beat it."
I bought these after discovering they were cheaper than any other brand I could buy in the store. I realized after several weeks that we were replacing batteries significantly less often after getting these.
I'm very happy with these batteries. Cheaper than a local deal at a hardware store. They seem to work as well as the name brands. I'm happy with the quality and quantity.
Good batts
Just as great as name-brand batteries! The only difference seems to be the labels.
"I'll keep this relatively brief. I use rechargeable, mainly Eneloop batteries for almost everything. Every once in awhile though I have something that doesn't need the more expensive batteries or are exposed to rougher conditions like remotes or outside hose timers where I just want something disposable. These work well for that. I would buy them again"
The price is cheaper that the other famous brands. It works just as great as the other ones. Since when Amazon started selling their brand's battery I am a fan1 of it. I buy AA and AAA. I truly recommend this brand.
Cheap price for your standard batteries.
Comes in a box that is convenient for storing. High quality batteries and not high quality prices.
"This may seem silly, but probably the main reason I love these is that they come in a compact cardboard box that easily opens and closes. Sick of having batteries roll around in a drawer, I was trying to find a container. None seemed to be all that good. But, with these, you don't need it! Such a brilliant concept! I get so many things in cardboard boxes that I throw out. But batteries Whoever thought of this deserves a pay raise."
"I've used Amazon batteries for a couple of years in everything from remotes, toys, flashlights, noise cancelling headsets, and portable games and have been very pleased. They have not let me down yet. The performance is comparable to what you get out of the leading major brands at a fraction of the price. You can save even more if you add these to your Subscribe Save items! You can't beet the price! I highly recommend them!"
great batteries for the price.
I've used 4 of these batteries now and the life appears to be comparable with that of Duracell/Energizer. The cost savings over the mainstream brands makes these a real winner! Would buy again.
"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand"
These were purchased to add to our many battery operated Christmas decorations. They continue to perform as advertised.
great price and now I have them on hand whenever I may need a battery!
Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage. Perfect for those toys (child and adult toys) that are constantly using batteries. I wish Amazon offered a package with prepaid return postage for recycling. I would pay an extra dollar or something if I could pack them back in the box and ship them back to Amazon for recycling. YOU HEAR THAT AMAZON
"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store"
"LEDs run thru these so fast man. But, I'm lazy and amazon delivers so I keep buying them. Don't have a time sheet. But I have one of those harbour freight free with purchase lights and it seemed to last 5 hours before I noticed it was dim. So that's good I guess as its still very bright, just not new, never been used bright.Usually I replace 1 out the 3 batteries every 3 weeks. But I work on a bike and car, and have never had any LED go out or get unusable dim during a job with a fresh change."
They seem to be lasting a while. They're batteries tho. So yeah. A convenience item for when you buy something else on here that needs batteries.
So far these batteries perform as well as any other alkaline battery that I have used. The cost even beats Duracell at Costco so I consider it a good deal.
Not really the greatest
Amazon Basics. That's all that needs to be said:)
These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.
"These are the worst batteries i have ever bought. Two days in my remote for tv and replaced and 2 days later,dead. Im very dissappointed with you Amazon for selling this to me."
"Love this when I'm doing my makeup. it was a lot larger than I expected which I really loved! The only con I found is that it is TOO BRIGHT. When I first used it, my eyes and head hurt because of the brightness. But overall, this is a great product."
Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.
These batteries die quickly!
"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window."
Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.
"These batteries don't last as long as the top brands, but for the price I can't complain too much."
decent batteries. doesnt seem to last as long as better brands. use it for xbox 1 controller.
These are decent batteries for a pretty good price. I haven't experienced any leaking yet. Would buy again. Will update if there are problems.
"Decent batteries for a great price, idk if they last as long as energizer but so far so good, I will order more for Christmas for sure."
"Amazon Batteries! They got me on the price, but how's the performance! Honestly I can't tell cause who's counting I usually by pro cells because Sometimes I'm a pro. Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available. These really aren't that bad. Pro TIP: Make sure you dispose them properly so you don't kill the earth. I'd definitely buy these again. Now that I am a father, there's all kinda of other things to put batteries in. Also do not skimp out on your earthquake kit. It sounds like whatever but honestly you need to prepare folks!"
Decent batteries price wise but don't seem to last as long as the name brand batteries and I assume these are actually some lower end name brand batteries that Amazon has their name stuck on them.
They die pretty quick in certain items. But decent price. Nice packaging though. I'd probably buy again just for remotes smaller items.
Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast.
"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life."
"I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned."
"AAA batteries. They make things go. I, uh...I have nothing else. I mean, batteries are pretty much--Oh, wait! They're quite shiny also."
Great deal!! Ive had no problems with these batteries.
"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. ."
DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!
"Ordered on accident when I had searched for RECHARGEABLE batteries. Not happy. I will be less free about ordering on Amazon from now on. My fault, but it made my put up my guard."
"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand."
died quick
these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.
these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.
"the last time i had batteries go dead so soon were the ones i purchased at harbor freight.. i had to change the batteries in a comcast remote every 2 weels and in my digital camera , without the flash after 20 shots.."
Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.
Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted.
Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it
Don't bother. The AA's I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries.
"Worked for one day, then stopped working. Can't tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn't register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend."
These things do not last very long either in the product they are powering or on the shelf. The ones we had on our shelf were not even good to use after 4 months of sitting.
"Additional info now a couple of months later... We were very disappointed in these batteries as they did not last long at all. We put one in a regular kitchen clock and within 1 week, the time was off by 20 minutes. Put them in a different clock, same results, time was off by 10 minutes within a few days, put them in a battery op shaver, which the other brands most of the time last at least a month, these lasted about a week. Even a small weather station about a week until the time was wrong. Got the 20 pack, not sure if it was a bad batch but we do not recommend these batteries and wont buy them again. Store brands and Rayovac last much longer. Original review below, still stands as easy opening but did edit to say how disappointed we are.Amazon basics AA batteries EASY OPEN packaging is FABULOUS, no cut fingers on sharp plastic packaging and no need for scissors, opened like a dream.... GREAT IDEA!!! Haven't had them long enough to see how long lasting they are."
These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money saver. Disappointed!
"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time."
Bought several times and they last
Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables
"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my joule thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.This may sound dorky-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remotes, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be powered."
DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :(
I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.
"I've bought a lot of AmazonBasics batteries, and nearly all of them have been more than half dead on arrival. My remote controls won't even work with the brand new batteries in place. I won't be buying these again."
So far so good. Let's see how they hold up over time. Hope they hold their charge and don't leak.
Good quality for the low price
They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.
"Great price, does the job. Used them to power BV Bicycle Light Set Super Bright 5 LED Headlight, 3 LED Taillight, Quick-Release. Gives very good light intensity, albeit first few uses. Can't yet vouch for how long these batteries last vs. Duracell."
good price good batteries
These are batteries so what can one say. ...they are economical and function. I bought light motion that require 3 AAA batteries. I needed 9 and they all work flawlessly. Plus now my remote control also works too.
It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse
"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results."
"These straight up don't work. I have put 6 different, brand new batteries from this pack into a controller and none of them have worked. Steer clear."
Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well.
"Don't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!"
These are priced nice but don't last long
Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all. So really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again.
I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. We will continue to buy them though because of the price.
"This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train."
I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.
"Don't last quite as long, but DAMN, you can buy three times as many as leading batteries. For our office staff, very worth it."
"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock."
These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.
The price point is what attracted me to these AA batteries. They last as long or longer than most other brands. We have several outdoor christmas decorations that use these and they performed great. AmazonBasics batteries are the best.
"Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios."
Don't see any difference between energiser or duracell and a fraction of the cost. Go Amazon!
"Great value for batteries in bulk - our household expends batteries quickly, so it's great to always have a backup supply.The low cost of these means I can afford to keep plenty on hand. The quality is comparable to most other brands we've tried - especially for video game controllers and the like."
"These batteries are supposed to be 1.5 volts. But I opened and tried to use them as soon as I got them and had problems.I checked the batteries and they only had 1.25 volts upon delivery and of course they are non returnable.Don't waste your money on these, go ahead and pay a little more and get the popular name brands."
"Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detectors. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product."
"Awful. Bought these specifically for my very small milk frother, these batteries can barely power the thing! I used whatever name brand in the frother before this and it ran full blast. But with the Amazon batteries, it gets up to like medium speed and doesn't even last 1/2 as long. Will never buy Amazon batteries again."
"Very, very, very difficult to turn on and off, not sticky enough and kept falling down, complete waste of money.When I could get them on and they were sticking, the lighting effect was very nice however, the quality of the product was zero."
The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.
"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them"
Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.
"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible"
"Exactly what I needed, lots of AA batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on."
"I've used theses batteries in several devices now, and they always run out of juice much faster than typical AA batteries."
I've only found 2 out of the box that have lasted longer than a week!
Drains Fast... Item just as described....
Not very long lasting batteries....
Duracell batteries last longer than these.
"Considering that Duracell batteries are guaranteed to leak and ruin your device, these are an excellent alternative."
"Had for about 6 weeks, easy to configure , no issues setup , works as advertised."
Does not last as long as name brands such as Duracell and Energizer.
"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! We have lots of frameless candles, so these are great"
These batteries appear to work well. We haven't had any problems. We will buy again and enjoy the savings.
Their batteries
"Why people buy batteries at the store any more is beyond me. The price on these can't be beat and they last as long as the name brand batteries. Even better they show up at your door, leaving you do spend time doing things you want to do."
Every battery had a voltage reading between 1.61 and 1.66v. Will update if the lifespan of these batteries is less than expected.
"They work really well, and the value is excellent for the price."
Exactly as described. Using these batteries in one of my remotes that seems to eat batteries on a bi-monthly basis. Definitely cheaper than buying from big box stores and work just as well.
Wonderful batteries! These batteries are great and last a long time.
A great product! Why pay more for batteries when these work just fine and are cheap! Thanks Amazon!
Excellent
Excellent
Excellent - not sure why I would ever pay more for batteries.
Excellent batteries. Can't complain! A lot cheaper than any other brands and you get the same good quality. Amazon doesn't disappoint.
"i now use AA and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name brands."
The price is unbeatable! Never buying batteries at CVS agaun
These Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the expensive name brand. I'll be buying these from now on.
"Battery life is equivalent to name-brand, mid-range batteries, which makes it quite a bargain. I am often surprised when I change batteries in a high-use device and realize how long these batteries last. They also have a nice look and when you buy a brick of them they are conveniently wrapped in bundles of 4, which makes for easy storage. They wont replace Duracell's in my high-power-drain equipment, but for everything else these are great."
Most bang for the buck for quality long lasting emergency power source. I would highly recommend this product!
Excellent
Great price and lasts just as long as leading brands of batteries.
Great product for its value. Amazon isn't doing things just because Amazon does things because they are needed by customers and this is just small example of that.
"Super excellent bulk pricing.Batteries are batteries and these work just as good as the big name brands.Have you seen the battery prices latley in retail stores Outrageous. Theses amazon branded, bulk, prime shipping simply cannot be beat in quality and cost.Stock up! Or not because you get them in a few days Prime shipping, no worries.They come in a nice compact package, and groups of batteries are shrink wrapped together for neat storage.Never buy those big names again! Get these instead!"
These batteries work just as well as named brands but much cheaper. Been using them for years.
"Throw away all my generic batteries and replaced with these. 48-Pack came in a nice carton box with 4-pcs. battery in each plastic wrap. Used in remote controllers, game controllers, mouse, automatic spray air fresheners, LED flashlights and camping lanterns, clocks, wall lamps, and other devices. Excellent batteries for the price."
"Excellent batteries, at a good price."
Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extras on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.
"I needed AAA batteries and it's going to be a while before I get to Costco to get some. I was buying something else on Amazon and decided to get some batteries, to give it a chance. They arrived in 2 days, they were well packaged and sealed, and most importantly, they work great, they hold a charge well, I am very pleased. Excellent batteries."
Fantastic deal on Triple-A batteries. I use a lot of them
"Nice and fresh, dated 10 years out! I use these in everything, should last a long time."
"Excellent power and price. You can't beat this deal on high quality batteries. Even the club warehouse prices for their own store brands are more expensive than these.They provide more than adequate power for everything we've used them for.They work very good for small flashlights too.Seriously. You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere."
"Excellent price and they last for a long time. Have not had one leak either, like the other brand I use to use."
"Excellent price, and they are long-lasting batteries. I have no interest in purchasing batteries from anywhere else from now on."
"Works as expected, excellent price!"
"Excellent batteries, work well, price is right. Cannot tell difference between these and the name brand."
These really do last a long time. I have bought them more than once and will again. Definitely recommend.
"Bought these on a lightning deal....10.50 for 48 x AA batteries. We go through batteries regularly even though we have some rechargeable batteries at home. Excellent...well packaged in a box where they can be stored until needed. Amazon basic batteries last just as long as, if not longer, than other branded batteries and thus they are a staple in our home for both AA and AAA sizes."
Excellent value. Well made batteries.
"These work just as expected and offer great bang for your buck. They are batteries after-all, there isn't much to them, and they serve only one purpose. These are just as good as more expensive Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries, but since they are AmazonBasics branded, you're not paying more money for fancier packaging and marketing."
I've put these on our recurring order. They last as long (and in some cases longer) than name brand batteries at a fraction of the cost!
Great value product!
"Excellent, no dead batteires so far. Nice to have a big pack, wrapped by 6 so they are not all loose."
A great deal and great quality! I'm now subscribed to receive these batteries every 6 months.
"Good, long lasting batteries!"
These are excellent batteries!
Excellent...
Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other brands
"Happy with my purchase of the 48-pack of size AA. As with all batteries, I check the expiration dates before opening. I got these in October 2016, and they will remain excellent up to March 2026. There is no way I can buy these locally at this price unless I go to a Dollar Store and buy already-expired or close-to expiring dates. I need these to replenish my emergency supplies. These came in one box, six sets of four wrapped together. (Edited to correct dates)"
"Went cheap...got cheap. DO NOT BUY. Went to pack for an upcoming trip and noticed brown stuff all over. I was storing the batteries in a separate case (which is now ruined). Thank goodness this wasn't in any if my expensive scuba or camera equipment. Never had other brands do this. Always store batteries outside of equipment anyways. Totally bummed. Shame on you Amazon. Get out of the battery business. I buy A LOT on Amazon... ALOT, but no more batteries."
Can't never have too many batteries.
I will only buy these batteries from now on. Extremely well priced and excellent longevity!
"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels."
Best buy for batteries! You'd think I'd never run out...and I don't with this great pack! Better than name brand.... Oh...wait...Amazon Basics is NAME BRAND!! Definitely recommend!
Really great product. Tons of batteries and for super cheap. I haven't had any of these die on me yet but even if they last only half of other brands it's still a really great buy. Super happy.
"I love stocking up on batteries at this price. Amazon, you've done a great job supplying the masses with inexpensive batteries"
I was skeptical at first of these batteries because they were so much cheaper then most but we have been using them exclusively for several months and they last just as long as other name brands
"These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive."
"Am amazed at how well I'm loving your batteries, Amazom. I have been a loyal Duracell buyer, but find yours are not cost way less, but last longer. Would give them 10 stars if you allowed me."
good batteries
ya....fine .....I mean its a battery .....How long they gonna last
: )
"1,63 volts"

"So far, they last as long or longer than the national brands."
So many batteries for such a great price. I'm even handing them out with the Christmas gifts i'm giving so that everyone can just use the gifts i'm giving right away! They last quite a while too. Much better alternative than buying name brand batteries in the store
So many batteries that last forever and way cheaper than the name brand ones in store!
SO much less than other batteries and they seem to last longer!
so-far good
Standard batteries at a better price.
Still going strong

Y'all have the best batteries with the best prices. Thank you!
Yay batteries!
yes they last just as long as the expensive kind.
you always need AA batteries very good
You can't beat the price! Lasts as long if not longer than national brands! This is my second order!
You can't go wrong with this many batteries at this price!
You have no idea how badly we needed affordable batteries in our house! Thank you.
For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem
For the price you can't beat these. I have never had any issues with them. They last long and work well.
When using these batteries in a professional camera flash (high powered device) they last only 3/4 as long as a similar duracell or energizer battery but for the difference in price I recommend these. In something like an xbox controller (low power device) they seem to last just as long.
"It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great."
"Why pay extra for Duracell batteries when AmazonBasics' batteries will last almost as long I bought a 48-pack of AA batteries for just 12 that's just 25 cents per battery! Meanwhile, Energizer Max was being sold at 14 for a 24-pack, coming out to 58 cents per battery and Duracell Coppertop was being sold at 12 for a 24-pack, coming out to 50 cents per battery. Amazon has proved the quality of its items over and over again, but I'd say they really outdid themselves this time. Ask anyone which battery brand is the best and most will answer Duracell, while some others may answer Energizer. That's because both companies, particularly Duracell, have built a solid, positive reputation as long lasting batteries, and not only do they last long, but they also survive a long period of time being stored. Some Duracell batteries even state that they'll last 10 years without being used, of which I have no doubt if any battery can last that long, it's Duracell. Nonetheless, Amazon has also created a battery that outshines most, and in most applications even outshines Duracell and Energizer. AmazonBasics batteries last a long time before having to be replaced and they come at a cheaper price than what you'll find in the dollar store, plus they look pretty cool. Obviously that last part isn't important, but it's nice to have a unique-looking battery that can be easily distinguished from all others. AmazonBasics also claims that their batteries have anti-leakage protection and can be stored for up to 10 years, just like Duracell. All three brands offer anti-leakage batteries, AmazonBasics and Duracell batteries are said to last up to 10 years in storage, and Energizer offers batteries that last up to 20 years in storage. If you want to store batteries for a decade or two, your best bet is Energizer Ultimate Lithium. If you are using batteries for important applications such as smoke detectors, although I suspect that AmazonBasics would fulfill its job, maybe stick with Duracell just because it has already proven over a long period of time the quality and consistency of its products, while AmazonBasics is still creating its name. But for pretty much everything else, from remote controls to cameras to calculators and everything similar, AmazonBasics should be your only thought when it comes to buying batteries.Here are links for what I believe are each brand's best batteries:AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack)Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA Batteries, World's Highest-Energy AA Battery, 8 countDuracell Ultra Power Aa Batteries 8 Count"
"Found these here before Christmas, and decided to order for our children's toys that required batteries. Can't beat the price for the amount you get, they work as expected, and long lasting. In my opinion the box they come in is extremely convenient compared to other battery packaging."
Affordable and usable.

I have two sons. They need lots of batteries for their toys. Thanks!
I purchased the pack to use with 4 walkies i had when we went on a 4 day cruise. Each walkie took 3 batteries. The batteries lasted 2.5 days of use. And i had to replace.
they work
Work like it should.
These batteries in a box are a great way to make sure you have AA batteries available by buying them in a box.
I like the amazon batteries and they have different sizes and quantities to order. I'm satisfied with the length of time they last and the price is OK also.
Good quality. I'll buy again.
Used in various devices without a problem. Long lasting and a good price! Will buy again.
"Good batteries, good price. No issues."
last a long time and cheap Got me hooked
GOOD BATTERIES... GOOD AS THE MAIN BRANDS AT 1/2 THE PRICE!!!
Great batteries....save some dough and use these vs the name brand. I haven't had any bonknbatteries thru amazon yet.
"Always looking for AA batteries, controllers for Xbox seem to need a lot of batteries. Nice packaging, too."
i have a lot of fake candles (battery operated cnadles) for night light when sleeping use a lot of batteries . i get this pack it lasts awhile. good bargain.
Good batteries!
AAA batteries work well
batteries came in good shape. They are not expired. The ones I used work just like an energizer or other name brands. Good deal. Fast shipping. Thanks
Batteries seem fine on arrival and after installing in lanterns. No issues so far.
Good batteries
Good batteries come celo wrapped in 4's
"Good batteries just like you'd buy in a store, but these cost a lot less money!"
Good expiration time and they work great. Always impressed with AmazonBasics Batteries because the price is fair.
Good quality batteries at an affordable price. The batteries are long lasting with good performance.
Great
Great but the packaging is not very intuitive. Sort of hard to get batteries out
I purchased these mainly for my remote controls. It's been several months and they are still strong.
"I use these in my camera, and remotes (the only two things I can think of that still take batteries), and these seem to last as long as any name brand batteries I've bought. Also, they are cheaper than buying name brand even in bulk (at Sam's or Costco). Good price, good performance."
"It's hard to love a battery. All I can say is they work, and they seem to last as long as any others. The price is good, so I'm happy."
Just as good as any AA battery. Just less expensive than Costo.
ProsGood valueWorks as expectedAppropriate batter lifeConsNone!
these are good cheap batteries. Seem to last just as long as the big name brands
These seem to work as well as any name brand batteries. I'll be ordering more.
These work just as well as the well known brands. I am glad Amazon offers a economical alternative.
"They are batteries, they work, and the are priced well."
They're batteries and work. That's what is important.
Works great and lasts long
Seem to be as good as any and the price is better.
Would buy again and again. Made using my bose QC15 that much cheaper!
These work just as well as the name brands.
I was pleased to see they are each marked with an approximately 10 year shelf life.
"Good buy. Wish I would of purchased these long ago. I have a lot of candles that I use year round and most of them take AA batteries. I also just purchased 6 Christmas candles that take 2 each. For the price, I also just got some of these color window candles and the Amazon batteries are working as they should. I honestly don't mind the cost of batteries so much when compared to the brand name batteries."
Good solid batteries at a good price. They dont last as long as the full retail name brands which means you do need to change them more often but overall still a money saver in the long run.
"Good batteries for a good price. I just got them before Christmas, and I used them in battery operated lights. They worked really well, lights were bright but they didn't last. I don't think it was the battery but the lights. I'll stick to a 5 start until i feel that they didn't work with anything else"
Great price and so far great quality! I haven't had them long enough to say if they last as long as other brands but so far so good!!!
"Saw this deal and could not pass up. I have a pair of headphones that use AAA batteries, they lost longer than expected i doubt i will ever run out."
"I have many AA battery operated things in my house. I use flameless candles that come on every night and stay on for 6 hours. I go through batteries. It was getting pretty expensive at the store. Found these, ordered them. Using them. They seem to be a high quality battery, unlike some others I have purchased only to have them last half as long. These are great!"
I've used these for a while now and have always been satisfied. Great price per battery. No need to pay a lot more for name brands for maybe a slightly longer run time.
"Good batteries for the price, they last a decent amount of time like other major brands. These came in handy near Christmas time with all the toys Santa brought. They are packaged in groups of 4 and I like how they have a container (cardboard box with cover) to keep them stored. I would definitely buy them again.they are NOT rechargeable and for some reason I thought they were when I bought them....had a brain fart or something. Good batteries overall regardless."
"For the price these batteries works as good as name branded batteries. I would compare these to Ray-O-Vac, but NOT Duracell!"
"Batteries are good, duracell might last just a tad bit longer but the price difference is not worth the extra . Kind of hard to review a batteries, but the packaging was easy to open and the batteries were neatly packaged."
These seem to be good batteries at a reasonable price. What's not to like
So far I am very happy!
These are good batteries. Amazon has a high quality standard with their manufacturers.
"They're batteries, and they're alkaline and they work very well."
"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands. (i.e. Duracell, Energizer, etc.) This is the only reason I have rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else about these batteries is great. I am getting low already and will probably order them again."
"Works great, packaging was convenient too."
"Good batteries, good price, I used these for the robotics club to power the LEGO NXT bricks. They worked wonderfully."
"Great price for batteries, enough said. Long life batteries at that!"
These batteries seem to be good quality and were a very good price.
"I'm a huge fan of AmazonBasics items and these AAA batteries are no exception. They seem to be of equal quality (as far as I can tell) to the big brands. They seem to be long lasting. Best of all, with the Amazon name on them you know that the company will stand behind the product. Batteries have gotten so darn expensive but these are actually a good price for a great item."
they work!
Great set of batteries no complaints and long lasting!
Don't be put off by the brand. These things work fine.
No complaints so far!
"Very surprised by this item. Was afraid to go with Amazon batteries, but am pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase."
Good batteries. Good price
"Good batteries. Unable to do a side by side comparison, but they seem to be as good as other name brand batteries."
Good quality battery at affordable price
"I think they are great for the price, if you want to spend more, buy rechargables"
Never thought I would buy battery from amazon brand. But everything seems good. good battery here.
These seem to be a pretty decent AA battery. I can't find any faults with their life span.
I can't buy enough of these batteries. I bought but the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. I always buy batteries around Christmas for all the toys and devices everyone gets. This year was no exception for batteries. The only thing that surprised me was that this was the first year I needed more AAA then AA batteries. As the year continues to have more demand for batteries and try to keep a good stock in case of emergencies. The AmazonBasics batteries have been working great. They last as long if not longer than the other brands and they cost less. Even coupon clipping and waiting for sales hasn't beaten the price Amazon has been offering. I have made a number of purchases for Amazon batteries already and will continue to make more purchases in the future especially around Christmas again.
"Great batteries for the price. I use them in Luna candles all the time. I leave the candles on all evening and night, so I keep a good amount of AAA batteries because I love my candles being different colors.. Keeping them on about 7-10 hours and they are a good battery."
These batteries do the job for which they are intended. They power the grandchildren's gadgets as expected and are reasonably priced. I like how I can order in large quantities so there are plenty of batteries on hand when needed. My experience has been that these batteries last as long as the more expensive brand name batteries available at the big box stores. I have bought these batteries multiple times and will purchase again.
"Have had good success with these and the Amazon Basics AA's as well. They come in a cardboard box, in sets of two which is handy to grab, although I still wish they were not plastic wrapped at all. That said it is far easier and takes up less space than the typical packaging from other brands.Battery life seems fine with these as it did for AA (I had less success with the Amazon Basics 9v which had a horrible battery life)."
Pretty much the best price i've seen for AA alkaline batts. I use them for flashlights and also for radios. They come packaged in a nice simple cardboard box and not blister pack.
As described
Bought them for the grand kids toys at Christmas and they work fine but that's all I can tell you because it's only been 8 hours.
"good cheap buy, works like the top brands."
Great purchase!
Great!!
Solid batteries.
these batteries work just fine and reasonably priced
They work well and a lot less costly when purchased in this way.
"What can you say, they are batteries and they work. Price was good when I purchased them.."
"WORKS FANTASTIC, EXCEED MY EXPECTATIONS, I WILL BUY IT AGAIN. GREAT PRICE, I CHECKED AND COULDN'T FIND IT CHEAPER ESPECIALLY WITH PRIME SHIPPING."
No issues with the batteries
"Work very well, works well for a family that goes thru batteries quickly!"
Great price for the batteries. Need these all of the time with just about all the things in my house. Lasts pretty long too!
"I keep a bag hanging in my pantry of all sizes of batteries (just one of my things). These AmazonBasics have held their own along with some more expensive brands. Haven't tested them one on one with other brands, but haven't noticed replacing these more often."
"Good cheap batteries. I mean they're better than those awful ones you can get at the 99c only store, and still cheaper than target's energizer batteries."
I love amazon basic batteries. I use these in TV remotes and a couple small LED flashlights. They perform just like other budget batteries and last longer in my lights. My battery box is now full of amazon basic batteries.
Batteries seem like any other they work and seem to last
Batteries that do their job: turn on my electronics. They last long too. Bargain price.
Batteries work well. Seems like a shorter charge than a duracell or energizer but for the price its worth it. Batteries will be changed a little more often but it seems to end up cheaper in the long run. Either way I am happy
Can't beat the price
Good deal
Good deal. Will buy again.
I use these in every thing in the house. They last just as long as the name brand batties.
"I'm really tired of buying batteries for my camera because they seem to last only for a few pics and then die. I put a set of these in many, many pics ago and they are going strong. Seem like some good quality batteries. For the price you can't beat them. They were the same price as the discount ones in the store but last much longer. Good deal!"
"Inexpensive, and they last as long as the pricey ones. I wish Amazon had a bigger pack of assorted batteries."
Ordered twice... work well
these batteries are fine and a great deal here on amazon versus purchasing in store
They work seem fine and they are a good price
"Who couldn't use a good supply of AA batteries. And, it makes a lot more sense than buying them 4 at a time at the convenience drug or grocery store. They are as good as any brand I have ever purchased in the past."
Best price I have found for this amount of batteries anywhere. Good life on them as well.
These batteries work great.
"these batters are a good deal. they die faster than the brand name batteries - for for the price, you cant beat it!"
"Received and look fine. Will see if there is actually any drainage time difference, but don't expect that. Will update if so. Good deal and my remotes, etc.....eat these up fast. LOL :)"
I have bought these batteries several times. They seem to last just as long as the big name brands but at a much better price.
"Super deal, and work great."
Great price and there holding up well.
Great battery that works really long
I always purchase Amazon Basics products just because they are good products and the price are reasonable. These batteries are good quality and last a good time compared to the well know brand names. This pack was a very good deal!
"I go through a lot of batteries, so for this price, these are a good deal. They are lasting a good deal of time and I would buy them again."
Work well. Price was right.
Great batteries.
It serves its purpose.
"These are basic AA batteries that get the job done. They may be cheaper than Duracell or energizer but they do not last as long in my experience. So you must decide if you prefer quality over price... I would buy these again because they are good enough for me. Much like most of the amazon basics product line, these hold up and if there's an issue, amazon will let you return them."
"As a rule, it's hard to tell the difference between one alkaline battery and another. Pull the Duracells out, and put in Everyready Alkaline Energizer, and you won't notice any difference in performance. Fifty years ago, freshness was a big factor, but alkaline has a long shelf life. These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while. I'll be needing AAA batteries soon, though, so I'll order them in a month or two."
"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviewers are saying, they don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries. If you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less."
"Long lasting batteries for my deer cam, compare to name brand batteries for way less money."
I love Amazon basic batteries. I always order them. They are not pricey and I get good for the money.
Good bargain for batteries! They're great for remotes and toys.
"Good deal that why I bought it, you should buy it too."
"So far so good, they seem to last pretty long."
Don't last as long as energizer but a great deal!
They're cheap for a reason - they don't last nearly as long as Energizer or Duracell's from what I've noticed.
Great for all of my sons toys
Nice price and works well.
This is as good of a glove as you will find for the money. Be aware the when ordering they are extremely small if you normally wear a large an extra large will still be tight and need some break in time. Order at least one size bigger
"so far they are work well, however have had them long enough to determine if how long they last compared to duracell batteries."
These die so fast. I might as well have bought a 12pack at. Costco or something. Good if u want clock battery that doesn't consume much energy
"Good batteries, seem to be just as good as other named brands."
good value for the amount of batteries
good item
They last a long time.
Good long lasting batteries
"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get."
Good pics.we will see how long that last..
Good batteries at a fair price.
"Good price, well packaged. I have not used them for any real duration yet. They are shrink wrapped. However, unlike the 9 volt batteries, you can twist the package and get through the plastic wrapper."
"Great price formance ratio, especially when I order a bunch."
Not tested so I'm not sure of quality
Solid so far. Good price
Work well enough in the small gadgets like remotes and LED flashlights.
Need aa batteries. Good price and good batteries
Good price for utilitarian batteries. Have not had time to see how long they last vs the more expensive ones.
"Well packaged. Shipped quickly. Long lasting, I was impressed because they are reasonably priced."
So far so good--and no problems anticipated!I really like the packaging--groups of 4 in plastic wrappers makes them easy to maintain in the package.
"Lasts long, good price, and keeps my kids toys running."
"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far."
"Perfect, great price, love it!"
"great price, they always have worked for me, my second order, at least"
"AAA alkaline Amazon batteries, they have a good price and seems to be working well, I will buy them again."
"Long lasting, works as well as Duracell and Energizer."
Good performance batteries.
Massive collection of batteries! Love it!
Seem to perform well. Good price!
works well with my baby's toys. good price!
"not much to say about batteries, they do their job and seem to last a good amount of time. I like the price!"
"Work well, good price."
These are a great price but they don't seem to last as long as you would expect. Also I have found some are already dead upon arrival.
Basic batteries. Good price. Have not used long enough to see how they last.
Good price. Only used a few so far but what we used seems to last.
Good price. So far batteries seem to be of excellent quality.
"Large package, good price. Work as expected."
Good deal on basic batteries. Needed several pairs for tv remotes and these worked perfectly!
Good price for these batteries. They seem to be of good quality and the price is right.
good product
great product good price
Trying these batteries for the first time and with all the good reviews I am sure they will be fine
"Good products. I like the Amazon batteries. The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors."
"Amazon Basics is great, the batteries last as long as other alkaline batteries and the price is terrific."
Great product at great price. Last just as long as ones I buy from store. With having young kids these are well worth it
Works as expected!
Arrived in time as described. Good product.
Good product. Perfect when you have kids and they think batteries are free in the store. Good alternative for Duracel.
"Haven't conducted any testing so I'm not absolutely sure about how these compare for performance to Duracell, Energizer or Ray-O-Vac. Gut feeling is that they are about the same as Energizer and Ray-O-Vac in performance and I can sometimes get Ray-O-Vacs on sale at Home Depot/Lowes for a competitive price."
Batteries seem to last a good amount of time and I received all of them in this pack unlike the AAA pack I bought from Amazon which was missing four batteries.
Batteries. What else can i say
Inexpensive but not cheaply made. Good purchase.
As Advertised
"Great batteries, last as long or longer than regular energizers and duracells"
"I bought these to use in my Xbox one and 360 controllers. These batteries are great but then again 2 batteries might last 3 nights, the next set you put in might die in the same night or they might last for a entire week. These seem to be doing better than the rayovaks."
I tested these by putting them in my sons jumper. That little boy really goes at it on that thing and we run through batteries like its nothing. Its been almost two hours (I put it on the music setting where it goes constantly and isn't based on his motion) and the songs are still playing without sounding distorted. A little pricey for being online and from amazon itself but all in all good.
Lo cost for long lasting batteries.
Nice quality of batteries. These run for a long time. Amazon basics products are good
These are good batteries at a reasonable price and have lasted far longer than the more expensive name-brand AAA batteries that I first installed in a set of motion-activated security and surveillance lights.
Good value for good quality batteries.
"As of this writing, I've been using these for over a year and have yet to experience any problems or issues related to dead batteries or battery life.I use a battery tester, and randomly measured a few, new, out of the box, and they all rated at 100. Happy with these batteries."
Great batteries at a great price!
"I've seen these batteries on amazon, but was uncertain as to their quality. After using them for several months, they seem as good of quality (or better) then many of the fancy name brands. I haven't had any leaking batteries and they seem to have a long life."
Good quality. They seem to last as long as most other batteries so no complaint here.
Good replacement batteries.
"Bought based on price. Now that we have had a few months, it would appear that these are as good or better than other name brands."
"they work well so far, cheaper than other batteries i have seen. hoping there wont be any leakage or anything."
"Good so far. I've not done extensive testing, but these seem adequate and the price is right. Definitely better than some other store brand batteries (Bass Pro Shops I'm looking at you) I've tried. They seem on par with major brand batteries to me, but that's a completely subjective evaluation."
"Lots of batteries, cheap price. Work great."
These work very well but took longer than expected for deliveryl
"seem always need this size battery, good supply for a reasonable price"
"long lasting and great price, I have two grandkids who are gamers and these are perfect"
they work. Good to buy in bulk. Needs to come in a bigger pack.
As described
Works great!
With children I like to keep a huge lot of batteries on hand. I also do not like to spend lots of money on batteries either. These batteries work well. Lasts long.
"The positive contact does not stick out as far as others brands so they may not work in all devices. Just discovered this today.Otherwise, they are good."
"As always, a good value from Amazon branded products."
Good value
Good Value
Good value compared to other national brand equivalents
"Good value on a good amount of batteries . They work fine. Not the best, but far from the worst . Would buy again"
"Good value seem to work as well and hold a charge as long as any of the major brands we've tried (Energizer, etc.)"
Great price for these batteries.
Great value for the number of batteries you get for the price. I haven't had them long enough to see how long they last.
Inexpensive but well worth the cost. I will order again.
Long lasting life
"Powerful, well priced, convenient"
"Really quick service! Glad to discover Amazon carries their own brand. Used tonight, and they seem to be great!"
Seem to work well will update if needed
Very good product. No issues. Great price.
"Why spend 2 to 3 times as much just to get a bunny with a drum on the packageThese work just as well as any of the brand names, and appear to last just as long."
"Work great for me. I have fairly small ankles so they may be too tight for someone with large legs but they should be fine for average. They DO keep my lower legs from swelling on long shifts and keep them from hurting which is great. And they feel good, nice and silky feel"
Works as expected. Good value
"Yay, a good value and now I have a big stock of batteries available when I need them."
Good Value and Price. Good Charge life. I will be buying more soon.
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.. What more could you want
"Good value for a quality product. Nothing special WRT performance, as far as I can tell."
"Good Value for the amount of batteries you receive.Great for TV Controllers, basic items. Gaming Controllers eat through these rather quickly."
Good value here. They seem to last as long as the standard Duracell batteries that we used to buy.
Good buy - these batteries work as good as all the other brands I've purchased!
"Good batteries, and better value then what is found in stores."
"Package of batteries came in Amazon shipping box measuring 13 x 9.75 x 3 . Inside that box with bubble wrap was a smaller cardboard box measuring 5.75 x 6.128 x .75. The batteries came in two cellophane wraps, 20 batteries in all 10 per wrapper.The AAA batteries measure 10.22mm in diameter and 44.22mm in length. Battery imprinted with Amazon basis. The battery is mostly silver accented with a green circle with a check mark inside. One of the ends of the battery has a little protruding button and is marked with a + sign. The other side of the battery is flat and marked with a minus sign. There are several descriptions and warnings printed on the battery. One of the messages with a black background states No mercury added with a note below that says Made in Indonesia with some more writing that looks like French. Also printed on the battery is a note reading ALKALINE BATTERY and below this, AAA/LR03/AM4 followed by 1.5V. There is some Chinese symbols as well. Another warning reads- May explode or leak if recharged, disposed of in fire, short circuited, or improperly inserted. Again this is followed with French writing. Also there are other warning labels, one with a small circle that has a line thru it, a small picture of a garbage can with a line thru it, and another small circle with arrows around a E.The battery fits in my small flashlight and powers up ok, but has not been in there long enough to test the longevity of the battery. Seems like a good value per battery if they last a while. I would purchase these again if they prove to last a reasonable time."
Good value!
"Great buy, fast delivery"
Good value.
"Good value. Lots of young kids, with lots of electronics."
Good value. perform satisfactorily.
"Last as long as Duracells, and don't blow up like Energizers. My go-to backup in my camera flashes on long shooting sessions, when my rechargable batteries run out.Yes, I had Energizer batteries heat up and pop inside a 500 Speedlite flash. Let's say that wasn't a good day for me!"
"Good, cheap batteries. They work well in my fire detector and in my remotes."
"Cheap batteries, but last longer than the rayovac I compared them to. Great to just have cheap commodity batteries on hand when a remote dies on you."
"So far, these Amazon AA batteries do as well as any others that I have used. Having a bunch of these insures that the many items needing AA batteries will always be usable AND they are mush less expensive then the little 4 packs you would purchase in any store."
Batteries. Lots of them. Good :) Nice value.
As expected!
They are batteries. They work. Don't know what else to say. Except they were ridiculously cheap!!
Good. bought about 20 packs so far. no complaints yet.
they seem a bit hit-or-miss...had a few kinda crap out pretty quickly (way too quickly) on me when used in my young son's toys
We'll see how long they last over time.
"I bought this pack of 36 Amazon Basic batteries for my 2 great-grand-children's Barbie doll and for a drone. It was part of their Christmas presents to go with the doll and the drone. Knowing the kids and how much they loved their Christmas gifts I knew that they were going to go through a lot of batteries--so I had to get a big pack. I can't speak about how long these batteries will stay charged as they just got them and also, I live over 100 miles from them and don't see them often. I will update this the next time I see them and let you know how long these batteries lasted. But for the money as many as you get, I considered this a good deal."
What a great value. We go through batteries like crazy with three kids. This has been the best I've found as far as performance and price. We are on autoship.
"Awesome value for the price, works great."
Great
great
Great batteries work just as well as other name brands.
great deal
Great price
Great value batteries.
"great value, high quality batteries"
I expected cheap batteries however I would compare these to energizer or duracell
I'm always having to run to the store for batteries. This is a great deal and the batteries work great. I'm very happy with them and only wish I'd bought them sooner.
"Perfect for the purpose, and economical"
Seems to work just like all the other batteries we've gotten. Needed a bunch for wedding lights.
So great for the perfect price
These are great for the price! Works great and hasn't died yet. I defiantly recommend l!
"I swear by these batteries. They go in to any of my devices that require AAA Batteries. They are long lasting, depending on the use of the item and for the price point they can't be beat!Absolutely Love them!!!"
Great AAA's. They seem to be of high quality. Not at all like the cheap ones you will find at some stores.
These batteries are cheaper than most others and last longer than industrial energizer or duracell. What a steal. Amazon basics for the win!
Have 2 girls and many other little ones to buy presents for this xmas and needed lots of batteries. These work well and are a decent price.
"Great alternative to Duracell. I needed batteries quickly and didn't want to get an overpriced pack from the drugstore, so I got these and they have been holding up well so far (it's been a few months)."
"Wow talk about great deal, these last longer then brand name at 1/2 the cost.Great batteries and incredible deal. First time buying Amazon Basic product but is great.Bought even more second purchase :)"
"Just as good as name brand, for a fraction of the price.Have been using these in numerous items, from remotes, to children's toys, to beard trimmer. Work just as good as name brand, and as far as I can tell the same battery life. Will definitely purchase from now on."
"Simple review here, because...they are batteries. Use these all the time and they are great!"
The batteries came packaged great and have lasted a good amount of time so far. They come in at just a couple cents per battery under Costco and Sams Club batteries so I thought I would give them a try and they were definitely worth it!
"A great bargain, 48 AAs for about the same price as 12 at the grocery store."
great bargain
These batteries are a great bargain. I bought these for my mother's blood pressure machine which gobbles them up. They last just as long as the name brands that she had been using.
"Great bargain and batteries, work as well as name brand I had been using. will be using these from now on."
"Love the great deal on these batteries. Being a techie and a dad, I go through a lot of batteries in gadgets and toys. These perform well and were a great bargain. Will definitely keep these stocked up!"
This was a great bargain for a bulk purchase of batteries. We always need batteries so having a stock on hand that was delivered quickly was a life saver.
I love Amazon Basics. They are usually well made and work just as well as any name brands.
Amazon batteries run longer and cost less. I buy all my batteries from Amazon now!
Good batteries! They last just as long as the name brands.
Great batteries at a good price
Great batteries for the price.
"Great batteries, nice to have and good price."
"Great batteries, will continue to purchase these...."
Great batteries. Love that we can buy them in a large quantity.
"Great batteries. We used to buy some cheapo batteries at Lowe's since they sold them in bulk, but Lowe's dropped them. Since we are Amazon junkies, I decided to try their batteries. No complaints. They work great."
Great Battery Life....Would Highly Recommend!!!!
Great buy and the Batteries are really great
Great price
Great price and high quality batteries that last as long as the brand name ones.
Love these batteries. They are all I buy anymore. They are long lasting and best of all they are delivered right to my door.
Nice batteries will but again
Similar to Costco batteries
The Amazon batteries have been great. I've been using them in my children's toys with no problems. They seem to last just as long as most other batteries. Except they're a fraction of the price which I love.
The fit and work for a long time. What more can you ask for
The price and the amount you get is amazing. So buy these batteries. You can't go wrong they are worth it
These aa batteries are affordable and they last just as long as the leading competitors or at least in my household. It would be nice though if they offered a program where people could send their old batteries into AmazonBasics so that they can recycle them but I'm sure Amazon is in the works with that idea as we speak
"These batteries are great! They work well and last really long. I figured these batteries would be a complete dud, but that's definitely not the case. Highly recommend!"
"These batteries work as well as, if not better than, the national brands at a lower price-point."
These have been great quality batteries for me so far. I'll continue to purchase through Amazon as long as the quality stays.
This is a great deal for AAA batteries and a no-brainer for anyone who goes through a lot of them. The life span on these batteries seems pretty comparable to other major brands although admittedly I haven't done any actual test to confirm this.I'll be back to buy more when we work through what we've already purchased.
Work great.
Works just the same as the more expensive batteries.
We usually only buy Duracell's but took a chance on these and are happy with the results. They cost less and last just as long. Thanks Amazon!
"Anyone with little ones knows that you chew through an incredible amount of batteries in toys, remote controls, stuffed animals with built-in lights, etc, etc....We've had such excellent luck with other AmazonBasics products (paper shredder, office chair, HDMI cables..to name a few) that we decided to give the batteries a shot and they do not disappoint. Packaging is very simple to get open, and since ordering the first pack, I've yet to replace a single one. I'd wager they will last just as along as name-brand ones we'd been purchasing for years. Will update my review if anything changes.In short, the high praise + reviews for these batteries are the real deal. Will certainly be back for more when our stock runs low...."
Great batteries and can't beat the price one more time and amazon Basics product worth buyng and saving money on love amazon basics products
Awesome value and we actually get longer use out of Amazons compared to other brands. I really cant say enough good things about our experiences with Amazon.
"They worked great and last ad long as or longer than the name brands e.g. (Duracell, Energizer)"
These are great! They work just as long as the other brands. I really think they last longer but I have no proof! One thing I love is the price and how Amazon does not change the price all the time. They have sales sometimes but when I run out I can always come back and get the at least the same price if not lower and that means alot to me! I really do not like battery price shopping all the time and this makes it so easy! I hope that helps! ray333ray2001yahoo.com
"Great batteries at a fraction of the price at local stores. Two batteries last 1 week in a mybaby HoMedics SoundSpa On-The-Go, playing 12 hours each night."
Great batteries at a good price and I keep buying more.
Great batteries at a good price. All Amazon Basics items I've purchased seem to be good quality. I'm sold on the brand.Update: 2-16-2016I've been buying the Amazon Basics batteries for quite a while and have found them as good as or better than any other brand. For now I will keep buying them in all sizes as needed rather than name brand batteries.
Great batteries at a great price! Last just as long as the expensive ones. Will buy these from now on.
Great battery for general uses around the home. I use these for motion sensing lights around the home. I have to change them often and I bought a large box to not worry about it for a while. I also like they come in a box that's easy to open. I keep them in the same box they come in and just label the outside of the box when storing.
I had no idea Amazon had their own line of items. These batteries are still going strong and were a great price. It seems like our household blows through batteries like there's no tomorrow so finding something that lasts is very important and Amazon has created a cost-effective way of achieving this.
We have had great luck with Amazon brand batteries and feel no need to pay big box brand name prices. We also loved being able to have them shipped to us.
"These work great and last just as long as the more expensive name brand ones you buy in the store. I also really like how they come in a neatly packed box for easy storage. I use these for many different things around the house, and never had any problems."
Great batteries at a great price. Not much more can be said!
"Great batteries at a reasonable price. These seem to last as long if not longer than your other name brands. I use these in toys, remote controls and other devices around the house, and haven't had any issues at all."
The price of these batteries are unbeatable for the amount you get. They perform very well and last a while. Will be buying all my batteries from Amazon going forward
An excellent way to get batteries at a good price without having to tote them home.
These batteries are just as good as other brands I have purchased and cheaper which makes them much better in my opinion.
These work like any other battery at half the price! They are long lasting and easy to use.
Awesome batteries for an awesome price. I will never buy any other brand of battery's from now on they work great and last very long . I use the batteries for my kindle firestick remote so not sure how long they last in other things but they lasted almost a year in my remote before running out of battery
I use a lot of batteries for the holidays and these were a good price so I thought I would give them a try. These are great and last as long as other batteries. I still have some left for the next holiday.
"Arrived on time, no damage. Great batteries for the price."
Great batteries for the price. I like having a large amount of batteries on hand for all of our electronic devices and the fact that we have kids and their toys constantly need new batteries. We used these for the first time this year and I have to say they worked great in everything we used them for. During the holiday's we had multiple light strands that were battery operated. The Amazon batteries lasted just as long as the name brand batteries at a fraction of the cost. The r/c cars seem to last as long as well. I will buy these again.
"Great batteries for the price. I've bought other generic off brand batteries before, even some from well know companies like Sony and Kodak (yes, they make AA's), and these do better than those."
Simple and extremely low priced than its competitors and does the job!
Great batteries great price
Terrific deal. The batteries last just as long as normal brand batteries and are at an insanely low price! Would recommend to anyone.
Why pay a penny more. They are exactly the same as Duracel or Energizer.
"Great value! When you have kids going through tons of electronic devices and toys, these are the best."
This are so much better then the Copper top and the Bunny Batteries. I use to buy mine off the bid board site. I started seeing new copper top leaking with a exp date of 2020. I ordered this and I'm hooked. This is my new supplier of Batteries.
"These are great batteries for the price. I purchased these batteries for my son, who loves listening to books on the Play-Away pods from the library. They seem to last the same amount of time as any name brand battery. I will be buying these again the future."
"I love these batteries. They are another excellent addition to Amazon's much appreciated line of Basics. I highly recommend them - I have used just about all of the available sizes I think by now, and I've yet to hit a dud. Much cheaper than the popular copper-top which used to be my go-to battery.GET THEM! :-)"
Great batteries that work great. Much better than going to the store and spending double on some name brand batteries! Definitely Buy!!!
"Using batteries for my Xbox controller and they last as long, if not longer than most other brands I've used in the past and at a much better price than most name brands."
So excited to get these batteries. Amazon definitely worked some magic. Item shipped in less than 24 hours and arrived before they were supposed to. Packaging was great! I loved the box that can close up and they were separately packages in packs of 4. So amazed at the product I reviewed. Will definitely recommend. Thanks so much Amazon!!
"These are just as good as any battery you'll buy in your big box store. ..I have two boys who love gaming and rc vehicles and we go through batteries like crazy. The price is awesome for 48 batteries, and I don't hear Mom, are we out of batteries every three days!"
"We got these inexpensive batteries for battery-operated candles for our wedding centerpieces. We didn't expect them to be the best batteries, but we only needed them to work for a few hours so we figured we would give these a shot. The batteries, as it turns out, work great. They kept our centerpieces lit throughout the ceremony and reception and didn't fade a bit. We are still using them around the house and they've been fantastic. I'll never shell out my hard-earned money for Duracel or Energizer again."
"We purchased the Amazon Basics batteries mainly for the price and shipping speed and love them. We've used them in all our household products like TV remotes, Xbox controllers and had no issues at all. So far they've lasted about 6 months in the TV remotes and have about a 2 month lifespan in our Xbox controllers which are used daily."
Low costs batteries that work great with good extended lifetime.
"Yeah, baby! Can't beat the price and I've been busy putting these in all of our things that need AAA - I had no idea how many. Glad I bought the big pack."
"Batteries last as long as I would expect, and they are a great price for A LOT of batteries. They cost as much as a 24 pack at the store."
"I think this is a great price for 48 batteries. If you are anything like me, i have never have batteries when I need them! Usually its the remote control, and I either borrow batteries from a different device, or switch the batteries around in the remote(which I may add does work very short term, but it does work!) When I saw these on Amazon I couldn't pass them up. We bought these in October, which was super helpful around Christmas. They come in a nice sturdy box, which is where I store them. They are packages in groups of four. They have lasted a while, and I have had no issues.I paid around 11 then and I just noticed that they are slightly cheaper with Subscribe and Save so needless to say I will be picking up another box. Great Batteries!"
Such a great deal!!
These are great AAA batteries that seem to last just as long as the expensive brands. No complaints and they're cheaper than pretty much any other option.
These batteries are inexpensive and they work great!
"We are always in need of batteries. I decided to get this batch and make sure i have some stocked up, for many items like remote controls and flashlights. Im happy with the quality that these batteries are and with the price."
Works just as well as the expensive batteries!
Great batteries! Can't beat the price.
"Great batteries! No need to pay 2 or 3 times this price for a name brand! I use these in the kids toys, remote controls, etc. I would only spend the money on a better battery on a critical tool, flashlight, etc. The way my kids use batteries in their toys, this is the route to go! They last just as long as the comparable name brand and come in much easier packaging!"
"Overall, great product, fast shipping, great service experience. Only reason I am rating 4 stars is the battery life seems less than the Duracells I used to use but I believe these are better overall value (significantly cheaper per battery) thus, this product certainly met my expectations but did not necessarily exceed them."
Love these batteries and last just as long as the top name brand batteries. Amazon will be the place I order all of my batteries from. Great dependable batteries. Love ordering in bulk and having spares.
Amazon Always has great performance with a great price!Love having a stock of these on hand with lots of kids.
"Bought with some lanterns, as it was easier to add with my lanterns than drive to the store and purchase. Standard batteries, work fine. E"
For the price these are about the beat batteries I have purchased.They last as long as other name brand batteries I have used.Overall very happy with the product and recommend it to everyone.
Great batteries. Don't waste money on buying name brand batteries.
Really good batteries. Use them in my new LED flashlights. Last a long time.
They are AA batteries. They work. I'm not a professional evaluator but these seem to be at least as good as the duracell or energizer batteries.
"They're batteries, what can I say They work! Seem to last a fair amount of time, better than the average bear!"
"What more could you ask for, Amazon sure makes it easy to get what you need when you need it. I was just digging through the junk draw when I realized I was completely out of both AAA and AA batteries. Amazon to the rescue. Two minutes later batteries ordered and on the way. Almost everything I normally use on a daily basis (or remember using) has built in rechargeable batteries, that is until I start thinking about remotes and game controllers, the little things that are just apart of my life without actually being memorable. Well that is while they work, I remember them when they don't work. This pack of batteries last me about a year (I think, just a guess) which is perfect. I tore the top of the box and threw the entire container in the front of my junk draw. I like how the container is just cardboard, not horrible formed plastic like the last pack of batteries I had. They are also separated into three vertical partitions of 4 sets of 4 batteries wrapped in plastic. Some may find this inconvenient with the extra steps of removing the extra wrapping. I like it, I usually need batteries in pairs of 2 or groups of 4, so i can just quickly unwrap a pack and go to town. This also makes it easier to clean up if I drop the box."
I use AA's a lot and have gone to rechargeable's for most things but there are some applications that you need just regular Alkaline's.I bought the big 48 back based on the previous reviews and the value of the bulk pack.I've used these in several applications from trail cams to flashlights and have been very satisfied and find they last at least as long at the Gold colored ones you buy at a much higher price.
great battery work great last long time
"great price, lasts a long time too"
"I keep reading how people theorize the energy usage of these batteries in comparison to the name brands. I can say that in high use devices such as flashlights, they do drain faster than Duracell. However when compared to the cost, you will still come out ahead with these, at least when buying in bulk.In addition I found that Duracell batteries gave me 4 weeks with the candles I own while Rayovac gave me 3 weeks. These Amazon batteries give me 6 weeks. So they are not only a better price but longer lasting as far as slow power drain devices.I have been using these batteries now for a great deal of time and with applicable use not pretty but utterly useless conjecture. Numbers and potential usage reports look all fine and dandy but are nothing compared to having purchased and used at least half a thousand of them. I love em. They work great in my nearly 100 electric candles."
Great batteries at an unbelievable price. Will definitely purchase more.
This was a great buy. The price is unbelievable for 48 batteries.
Only way to go for great batteries!
Great battery value but they don't last as long. I will order them a couple of more times to see how they work.
"They are batteries, they are cheap, and they work. Most research shows there is no significant difference between alkaline batteries, no matter what the brand. Buy these, save yourself some money. You won't be disappointed."
"The arrived as described and all seem to work great! They were the best price of all the batteries, but are a quality battery."
Great battery! Works better than Duracell on my garbage can.
I will from now on but Amazon battery's! Super cheap and they actually last when compared to other overly priced battery's. it's a no brainer.
I like the battery and the saving. It seems it doesn't last longer compared to other popular brand. I don't mind changing battery after paying 4 time less than a popular brand
"I am starting to think my teenage daughter eats AA batteries for extra energy. If you need bulk batteries, the Amazon batteries can not be beat."
This is a great purchase! I recommend it to anyone who isn't looking to spend the same amount for like 6 batteries. This is bundle is a great deal. The batteries last for a long time!!
Fantastic buy and shipping was quick and easy.
Good price and quantity. Comparable to other brands.
"Haven't use any yet, but I feel good about AmazonBasics products"
these are great batteries and priced right...........so nice to have so many on hand!
Work as expected. Great buy.
I have been buying only amazon batteries for months and I am completely sold on them. I have had zero issues with them and they seem to work just as long if not longer than any of the high dollar manufactures you'll find in any store. I run them in everything from high drainage RC cars to led flashlights. I have used them in bubble machines for my daughters birthday party and the batteries were soaked with water and bubble mix. the batteries continued to function without issue. Great buy and good longevity
"Nicely packaged in a very sturdy rectangular cardboard box that serves to store the batteries. Started installing the fresh batteries in my devices the moment I received them, beginning with a thermostat and two remotes. Still have 42 to use and share. My only quibble is that I would have liked to find a 24- or at least 36-battery AmazonBasics package offering. I hope these alkalines stay strong in storage."
"last longer then maxell batteries and dont get near as hot when in heavy use as other batteriessize normal AA size.material good aluminum and Alkaline.quality great don't get to hot in full use and last a lot longer then others iv tested.pro's long lasting, don't get to hot, good materials.con's noneoverall great batteries great quality great bargainwould buy again yes they seam to be great batteries use in all devices like flashlights, cameras, remotes, ext also get a lot for the price"
"I can't say enough good about this box of AA batteries! I buy these probably 4 times a year because we have 5 grandchildren in our home that have tons of toys, all needing AA batteries! It's nice to have a box of them handy and these are great batteries that last a long time!"
Good batteries at a good price!
"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."
"Packaged well, comparable to duracell or energizer...they work just as well for a fraction of the price so all and all a good buy and will be ordering more when needed......"
"These batteries work just as well as the name brand batteries and they last just as long at a much better price point. I purchased these for the company, but I was so impressed with them that I purchased these batteries in AAA, AA and D on my personal Amazon account for home use and paid the same for a bulk package of 48 as I would have for an 8 pack of name brand batteries. They come in a sturdy cardboard box that comes in handy for neatly storing them. Amazon also printed the size of the batteries on the side of the box, making it easy to just grab the ones you need. Never again will we be asking each other if we have any (insert size) batteries and if so, where are they...or even worse, having to borrow a battery from one device to work another!"
I am a Duracell fan. I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries.
These are cheap and work as well as name brand batteries.
"Amazon Rocks great deal, we will buy lots of these in the future"
Best buy in great batteries. Last a long time.
"Great batteries at a fabulous price, what else can I say .... Seem to last as long as actual Duracell"
Great batteries can't beat the price! Thank you! A+
Great deal on batteries.
Great deal.
great quality
Great value...same quality as the big boys
This deal is beyond amazing. Come Christmas this box of batteries for the kids toys is going to be a great deal. I was able to fill everything that took batteries in the house and they last quite a while too
What a great deal. I just hope they will last as long as the big brands
"Yep, they are batteries. Dirt cheap. Why spend more"
"Perfect and what a great deal. Better to buy in bulk, FRUSTRATION free packaging I love this!"
"These batteries are seeming to last a good amount of time. I think this product is a GREAT value considering how many batteries you get for the price, they are reliable and durable as far as I have used them. Great bargain!"
"We go through a lot of double a batteries. After seeing Amazon sold in bulk, I had to get them. Then, I decided if I bought a bulk supply of triple a, I would never need them again which we all know is not true... never seem to not need batteries. Product works well and I would purchase again"
"Great price, fast delivery...what else could you ask for"
I use these for my remote flash triggers and my intervalometers and they last a pretty long time.
Double AA batteries for about for about a quarter apiece. Very solid deal. Five stars.
Works as expected. Great deal on the item and have enjoyed using it.
"Thanks Amazon, this is a great deal. These batteries seem to last as long as their name brand counterparts, and there a ton of them!"
"Awesome deal for batteries. We have had zero duds, all batteries have a great battery life, and the price is unbeatable. This is a great buy for things like remotes and other odds / ends where battery changes are infrequent."
Fine! These seem to last as long as the name brands and are much less costly per battery.
Great batteries at a fair price!
"Great price, good batteries, I'm happy!"
Love these batteries and price was fantastic for the quality!
Such a great deal for a LOT of batteries! It's always nice to have so many on hand. You never know when you're going to need them. Haven't noticed if the life is shorter than brand names. So far so good!
This is the best deal on batteries around! They work very well! I replaced the batteries in all my kids' toys.
this work great so far! Such a great prices I was waiting for them to fail but so far they are working like powerful batteries should!
"when I was a kid we never had batteries, as an adult I dont let that happen. great deal."
"These are the best most economical batteries you can get for low volume consumption items (which is 90 of what we use these days). I've used dozens of these and never had an issue with corrosion are leaking. Used mostly in remotes, toys, flashlights and general household items. Excellent bargain. Now we need to get Amazon to provide recycling as well!"
I found the electrons in this brand of battery to be more uppity than in other brands. They get jiggy wi' it.
They're batteries. They batter well. Great even.
"Best everyday price I have found for high quality AA batteries. I only ever used national brand or Kirkland batteries in the past. These are just as good, at a better everyday price. Yes, I have found batteries on sale to be cheaper, but you have to catch the sale. However, I never seem to run out of batteries when there is a sale. So I stock up on these."
Great packaging and value
Arrived on time. Great for baby toys
"Now that is A LOT of batteries. I did not take a meter to them, but they appear to last as long and work as reliably as any name brand battery. Great for keeping all those Christmas presents going."
Good batteries that hold charge and great price!
Works ok. Doesn't last too long
"For the price, I really can't complain. The life of the battery seemed comparable to other generic batteries. Great for remotes and other low use items. However, my son put these in a small indoor remote controlled helicopter and it chewed through them pretty quickly (which I expected). Again, good for the price and the right usage."
"Decent longevity in electronics we use daily. In remotes they're fabulous, less so in more demanding electronics like games, cameras, and the half dozen Thomas trains my son loves. For the price in comparison to Duracell or Energizer you can't go wrong."
"Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remotes in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices."
Good
"Great for the price. I really recommend this, i got this to light up the patio with lantern for an event they work all day and all night with no problem i count be happier!"
No issues. Great for the price.
These are a great deal for the price. It always comes in handy to have extra batteries around.
What a bargain for every day use. One has so many items that run on battery power and getting batteries by the box full is ideal. Thanks Amazon!
"These batteries are a great value. I got the 48 pack and for the most part, the did not disappoint. However, there were a few that did not work. Then again, i've always been pleased with Amazon's products and will continue to use them."
"They Work For Me, Don't See a Difference between the other brands. Its Cheap so I will buy it again when I run out."
In support of the snmap circuits - I was very happy with this purchase for my 9 year old grandchild who loves electroniucs and uising his hands
great item
"These batteries work great! They're not quite as good as Energizer or Duracell but they are a close second when it comes to the life you get out of them. When you compare the cost of these to the name brand examples just gave, these are a no brainer. I cannot recommend these highly enough. You will not be disappointed."
"These batteries work very well and come packaged extremely durably. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish I had bought more, as these ran out quickly after all the toys my son received for Christmas this year. Can't go wrong with Amazon Basics."
"Bought this along with Maisto R/C Rock Crawler Radio Control Vehicle (Colors May Vary) for a grand son's birthday, so his parents would not have to hunt for batteries, They have said they were long lasting, and were very happy with them"
"Office use, works great. I would highly recommend a battery tester! My sons constantly say that wii remote batteries are bad when they aren't!"
These batteries are way cheaper on Amazon then in the stores. The batteries lasted a long time and I won't run out any time soon.
Great packaging - nice little card board box to store the batteries in. Beats the packs batteries usually come in.
Packaged nicely in four packs and within a sturdy cardboard box. They work great!
"Love the fact that they come packaged 4 batteries to pack, put in a box that you can open and close. No more fumbling with batteries."
Great performance from these comparable to name brand options
"Great performance, better price. I don't feel like I'm buying cheap, I feel like I'm buying name brands batteries that are relabeled. They work great."
"Very good performance and long lasting at a better than the dollar store price. I use AmazonBasics in a laser pointer at least twice daily for about twenty minutes a day. My dog is high energy and we live in an area where the weather is yucky and inclement. Yes, I know you aren't supposed to use a laser with dogs (I found that out 2 years too late). But that is the only way my dog can get enough exercise and not drive me crazy. I use to good through batteries like crazy. That being said, I have tried the better brands and AmazonBasics batteries and these seem to be superior in duration and very affordable."
"We got these because they were inexpensive and we wanted to have plenty on hand for our Christmas window candles that have a timer. I bought the big box because I thought since they were so cheap, we'd have to replace them partway through the season. I'm pleased to say that the original set of batteries I put in the candles at the start of the Christmas season, about 6 weeks ago for us, are still going strong!"
Recommend
glad to have these--always need a battery for something
Great batteries
Great batteries and amazing cost I also love how they come packaged easy to store away and use when needed! Thanks Amazon!!
"Great batteries for the price! We are one of those families that goes through a lot of batteries. It seems we need them more and more with ceiling fan remotes and remotes for technology devices. The batteries seem to last just as long as any other brand, but these are far cheaper."
Great price and they work very well will continue to buy these amazon batteries compared to the other brands in the future. Loved to save money and the work the same as the other competitors.
Great price great item. Would buy again
Great price. No problems with the seller
"Have installed these in several devices and they are working and lasting fine. I'm always leary of off-brand batteries, but these seem perfectly fine and were a great buy!"
One of those guys on saving money sad there is no difference in alkaline batteries. I hope he knows what he's talking about.
So far so good. Great price for everyday batteries.
These work just fine.
You cannot beat the price! The batteries are of good quality too and last a while!
Great price! I finally put a big storage shelf in my garage so starting to stock up on things I use regularly. My only complaint is they are packaged in groups of four which is kind of a pain to unwrap each time you need them.
Great price and great performance. I loaded 10 of these batteries into my Field Camera 6 months ago and the camera is still taking pictures.
"same as above batteries, great price and long lasting and appreciate quality and great price"
"I haven't tested them to compare to other brands, but the Amazon batteries are a great price and great packaging. It's a nice add-on product and amazon makes it easy to stock-up on batteries without name-brand prices."
"Great price and they work- can't ask for more then that. How does Amazon do what they do- good price, great customer service, and they are very profitable. What a great business model!"
Great quality
Good price and they seem to last and work as well as name brands.
Not much to say. They are batteries and they work. Great price and they last just as long as any others.
Great batteries
Great set of batteries. Comes in handy for all the equipment I use.
Arrived fast and perfect for my needs to be used in flameless candles.
Good deal for batteries that we seem to use a lot!
Great price for batteries!! They do the job as expected! I was nervous they wouldn't last as long because they were so cheap but they last just as long as name brands.
great price for the quantity - much cheaper than the store. appears to be a good quality from what I can tell. definitely will buy again.
great price good quality
They perform as advertised.
"Great price, and more convenient than going to Costco"
"I've almost gone through the whole pack, and so far I've had nothing but good experiences with these batreries. The packaging was really convenient and the batteries work as they should. I haven't thought about them, so that is a big win in my book."
"Great price, don't think they last as long as Energizer, but these might work out cheaper due to quantity and price in purchase compared to Energizer."
Great price on good batteries. They last as long or longer than other brands and you can't beat this price!
"Work great, and saves me a trip to costco since they are priced around the same."
"Great price, work as long as any other battery"
"Good price for the quality, thank you!"
Great price!
So far so good. I use these in a flash unit for photography. While not fully running off the batteries as I have an external battery pack they do work well.
This is an excellent price for AA batteries! I use AA's a lot and I have enough here for a while.
"Batteries are Batteries, Great Price."
"Decent batteries, great price."
Not sure what else to say other than these are cheap batteries. Great price.
Work as expected. Great price.
"Works well, great price."
"So far no problems, great price. Haven't had a chance to find out how long they last."
Great price. They're batteries.
great price. waiting for another sale
Great price. Work as expected.
Great price for some really good batteries
"Cheap batteries for the win! They work. They last a reasonable amount of time. I can't compare to other brands because I don't track batteries that closely, but they last long enough for me. I would buy again."
Great batteries. They last longer than the name brands at a great price.
Great battries use them all the time
Great product ....glade i bought the bundle ...
great product very happy with the purchase.
"Great way to stock up. I will buy batteries exclusively from Amazon from now on.It can change from time to time, but mine are made in Thailand."
"love the price, love the quality."
The batteries work great and the expiration date freshness is good.
"This is the second time I am buying these batteries (for my noise cancellation headphones). No complaints on the product and the packaging is excellent - frustration free, as described."
"Wonderful price, these seem to be lasting just as long as any other battery we have used."
Great product - works exactly as I'd expect!
Great product a great price point.
Great product as a great price
Same as purchasing any other brand name batteries. They have lasted as long as any other brand. Love receiving all these non-perishable items in bulk at my front door at a better price than any store without having to carry them or leaving my house.
Great product at very reasonable price!
"Great deal. Though bought them so quickly thought that they were rechargable. They are great, especially for the price. Unfortunately I would rather recharge,"
"dude, for the money you can't go wrong with these. Great product!"
"These batteries are perfect for work, I use them in my keyboard and mouse. I type and click all day every day and they last a couple months which in my case is great for every day use and I am hard on them for sure. Great product"
Great product at a nice price.
"Excellent purchase, definitely came in handy for Christmas, my kids received lots of toys without batteries lol"
My Amazon insider suggested these. He made a great recommendation.
"Great batteries , great price and speeding shipping like always. I was a bit worried because we've always purchased one of the two leading battery brands. These last as long and are super convient to order. This is how we buy are batteries moving forward"
Great batteries at an even greater price. Mucho Grassyass.
These are high quality batteries. We have been using them in multiple devices and they appear to function as well as any national brand.
Work as great as other name brand batteries I've used.
Excellent batteries for the price. Never had a bad battery with them and I've ordered several boxes. Having them packaged in a recloseable box is a nice plus.
Does what batteries should and battery life is good.
"Great AAA batteries, comparable with brand name batteries on the market. i bought the 36 pack and it come with a group of 4 which is great to bring it for traveling. it is really a good deal especially if you see the price and the quality of the batteries."
As good as any 'household name' brand and far more reasonably priced.
Great quality given price. Has a strong charge per battery.
"These are great batteries and way cheaper than any other quality batteries I could find. I didn't even know Amazon made these. To top it off, they were available for same day shipping, which is always convenient."
I'll make it simple. They work great! The bulk pack was worth the buy and all the batteries appear to have a full charge. Just compare prices.
Great quality. Love it!
Great rechargeable batteries. Came pre charged. Worked great.
Great review about this product. I can't wait to use it. Nice packaging with a quick delivery! I am glad to get this items!
Excellent product
Just as expected. Batteries standard life.
aThey are good quality and light up my LEDs to a very bright level
Can't go wrong with AmazonBasics batteries - quality at a great value.
Cheaper than my local box store. No complaints. Great value
Good batteries at a good price. Not much else to say. I always try to keep these on hand.
Good quality batteries and cheap. Tend to get through a lot of batteries and these are as good as high end brands.
"Great quality , best value ! Never going back to brand name"
"Great quality product. I haven't done extensive testing or anything, but they seem to last just as long as Energizer batteries. All of the batteries worked as they should and the value was a good deal."
Great value
Great value and exceptionally long lasting.
Great value for the money.
Great value! Highly recommend
great value. Bang for your bucks. Packaged well too.
Great value. Work as well as any name brand battery.
Hard to beat the value
"I purchased these to replace the batteries in my LED motion lights that are used in my basement closet. For the amount of batteries I received compared to the cost, I doubt I'll ever buy the big brands again. I have no complaints."
"I use a lot of batteries. It seems now, there are remotes for everything. Recently I had installed new batteries ( not from Amazon) in a remote for my gas logs. It beeped but would not come on. When these batteries arrived the next day, I put these in the gas log remote and it worked. Yeah! I also use them in the air freshener canisters, I'm in rescue and have these fresheners in every room. People who come for the first time are amazed that my home smells so good. I use them in my keyboard mouse also. If you think about how many batteries you use, buying them in large lots having them on subscribe and save is a huge help. These are packed well and are also packed within the box with plastic. Great Value,"
I will never buy batteries from the store again! This was a fantastic deal!
"Rated by Consumer Reports as recommended, this is a good battery at a great price. True, it does not match the latest Energizer Ultimate Lithium, but that battery is far more expensive. These batteries come packed in a plain brown box, and sealed in clear plastic by twos."
Really good value for the money. There could definitely be less packaging material
So far they seem to last as long as the top brands for a lot less money! I will definitely continue to order these batteries!
"These are a great value. I've gotten tired of buying expensive batteries, putting them in my kids toys and then changing them again a few days later because they have left the toy on. This is so much better on my wallet."
"They are cheap and work well, no issues at all. Very pleased with my purchase."
"They do the job at a great price. Also purchase AA, D, 9V all the time for company."
"What can I say They're AA batteries! I like the value of these, they're probably at a great price because they're Amazon Basics."
great value - awesome product.they seem to be holding up as good as any namebrand batteries at a fraction of the price.
great value and last a long time
"Bought these to go along with my Bose QC25, as they require 1 AAA battery. Have found these to last as well as any other major brand AAA battery in the context of these headphones, so am very happy!"
"The toy companies and the battery making companies have a long running conspiracy to make you buy millions of batteries for your kids' toys. Thanks to Amazon, I can break the cycle of the evil conspiracy and just buy these cheap but long lasting batteries! Thanks Amazon for helping me stick it to the man."
These batteries work well and at a much better price than you'd pay for quality anywhere else.
These batteries are a great value for the price. They work just as well as the known brands like the bunny version. I like that I can get them from Amazon and don't have to remember when I am in the store. This comes in real handy around Christmas time when I am ordering gifts and always seem to need batteries. Thanks Amazon for helping out with my budget.
Bought these for various electronics and so far so good. I use to buy Procells but they seem to not last as long and I wanted to try something different. Amazon seems to make good generic products and I'm happy with these batteries so far.
Can't beat the value here.
"I thought that I would give them a try, and I am surprised that these batteries seem to hold up as well as the 'ole copper tops--a great value. I have now bought my second package of these batteries, because I still like them better than anything else that I have tried. Price, value, and quality considered."
Great value for the money! Long lasting used for my battery operated candles that were on at least 10 hrs a day and never had to replace my batteries during the Christmas season.
GREAT VALUE!
These batteries are first rate and fresh. Great Value for the price!
I am so happy with my Amazon battery purchases. I won't switch back to another brand again after trying these.
Last just as long as any other battery. Great value for the purchase.
"After reading all the reviews for the batteries I decided it was worth trying since it as a great price for 48 batteries. Our family does through AA batteries like crazy. So as long as they last- I'm happy. I do see though that in electronics toys the battery doesn drain faster then in kitchen gadgets. But again,in my opinion it's still worth buying these batteries."
Can't go wrong with a good value on high quality batteries. I love AmazonBasics for helping me save money. Batteries are great quality and price!
"I've been purchasing various sizes of these AmazonBasics batteries for a while now, they're a great value in comparison to other brands. We are often using these in fairly mundane ways---remote controls, small flashlights, toys---but have also had success with them in game controllers that commonly drain batteries really quickly.One bonus with these AAs: they are shrink-wrapped 4 to a pack within the larger box. This makes it really convenient to toss a 4-pack in a purse, backpack, or glove compartment: no loose batteries rolling all around, and you know all 4 are the same age when you pop open the plastic wrap."
These are great value and I see no difference between the big name brands. I will be ordering more for sure.
"I have a point and shoot camera that is a battery guzzler. I went on a 10 day trip abroad, and bought this pack of batteries. Either my camera wasn't as big a guzzler of energy, I didn't take enough pictures, OR these batteries are fantastic. In any case, I only went through three sets of four, for a total of 12 batteries. I have a huge reserve left for future picture taking. Did I mention they are at a great price I will definitely forego the grocery store and shop these batteries in the future."
"Just as good as the top brands, but cheaper. Nothing more to say."
"A great buy for consumable, everyday batteries!RayB"
Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good
Great value!
I'm shocked at how long these cheap batteries last (mainly in LED candles). Great for items that don't use a lot of energy.
It's always nice to have batteries on hand and these last. Great value!
They seem to last as long as name brand batteries.
"We love Amazon brand batteries. I feel like they are very comparable to the other name brands that are out there. We use these in our trail cameras, GPS systems, and around the home in the TV remotes, electronics, etc and I don't feel like I've had to change them any sooner than other batteries that we have. I think these are a GREAT value for your money and love that we can get these as apart of the subscribe and save program. I never have to worry about running out ever again!"
Work as well as any other battery...IMHO!
We have ordered these many times and love them. We have them on subscribe and save and get them regularly. They are a great price and they work great!
Great value!!
Great delivery time and was so happy to get these. So much more affordable than store bought batteries. Soon as I got them I put them in 2 different remotes and all worked fine! Would definitely recommend these to anyone!
As advertised. Is what it is. Great value.
Great Value!
"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far."
These batteries are awesome for kids toys that don't have moving parts and only music. Also works great in remotes and things like that. Great value for what you get. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
great value. Will have to see if they last as long as name brand batteries.
They have all worked so far.
I use these for my xbox controllers and they're fantastic!
Great batteries. I haven't noticed a difference between these and other top name brand batteries. And these are way cheaper!
Great!
"I use these for remotes, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers, even after I get a low battery warning they still work a VERY long time and I can not tell any difference between these and more expensive brands. I will be buying more of these and possibly moving over to the rechargeable ones."
Just as good as the name brand batteries for a better price!
Love Amazon brand anything - had no idea they did batteries too! What can I say they're batteries! They seem to last a long time.
Love these compared to the big brands. I have these on hand at all times. They seem to last just as long as the more expensive options. Buying in bulk just pays for itself in convenience IMO.
So far no issues. They're great batteries. They're such a good deal that after I got these I replaced the batteries in every device I own that uses batteries (to avoid old batteries corroding and destroying anything). So far dozens of devices (from flashlights to remotes) have been working perfectly. Very happy!
Thank you
These are great! work just as good as the expensive name brand
Work great! Great deal!!!
You get the bang for your buck!
Great Batteries and a fantastic price!!
"Long lasting battery, great price! What more could I ask for"
GREAT VALUE!!
"great. seems like a well made battery, great price. amazon had super fast overnight shipping."
"fantastic batteries as good as if not even better than the name brand batteries. With a four year old that 90 of toys need a battery, these are a life and money saver."
Love amazon batteries. Lasts just as long as Durecell or Enegizer or any other name brand but are half the price
they dont last as long as the higher end rechargeable do or the regular batts do. I would say about half the time.
great price
"Seems to work well I haven't been using them long, but have not had any problems"
"Well-packaged, good value, and functional!"
"Overall, happy with the product. They work well."
They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.
Nice!
have you ever needed some double A batteries well look no further!
These seem to work well. Haven't used them for too long but they were a good price.
These batteries are awesome for the price. I actually did a weight comparison and they were very comparable to Duracell or Energizer. (Go grab a cheapo battery and compare that weight to a Duracell or Energizer battery... there is a significant weight difference.)
Yea. Batteries. What can ya say. Ya can't miss with AmazonBasics.
Another way Amazon makes my life easier!
"Great batteries, just as good as Duracell if not better for a SWEEEEEEEEET price."
High quality batteries at an excellent price. Will buy again when needed.
"These have worked wonderfully for me. The price is right, and they're at least as reliable as any other brand I've tried. I'll be reordering for sure."
These last the longest
"I get as good or better performance with these batteries as I do with any name brand batteries, but these are far less expensive, even compared to bulk packages in stores. I use a lot of batteries, so these were a great find! I love that the batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of four, thus making it easy to carry back-up batteries on-the-go. I have purchased these multiple times and will purchase again."
These batteries work just a well as the name brand batteries. I have purchased these in many different sizes and have nothing but good things to report. Save yourself some money and try these. I recommend them.
Just as good as Duracell. Would highly recommend for anyone living on a budget.
"It's a bargain! Works just as well as regular, higher priced batteries for a fraction of a cost. Highly recommend!"
Great batteries at a great price.
Great Value!
"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems."
"Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be duds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why..."
I didn't have any issues with these batteries dying on me but I am hesitant to make them a staple since it seems like there are others who have gotten bad batches. I will wait it out to buy again.
Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.
What a deal! And finally I will not run out of batteries! What a great idea... a 100 of them!
"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free."
got it because of reviews. I really can't say they are any better than any other cheaper or more expensive brand. how can you rate it or check it. when your remotes stop working you put in new batteries.simple as that.
I absolutely love Amazon Spring end I never have any complaints they always stand behind their products although it's never needed because their products are normally made very well with quality materials I only buy my batteries off Amazon no I will not pay the price in the store as I find Amazon's batteries last approximately the same as like Energizer or Duracell and thieves Amazon basic brand batteries are probably half that price
I am a professional photographer and have these as backup for flash. kids steal them for their gaming.. they work and last the same as every name brand.
I am satisfied the batteries I recieved are just as good as any other name brand batteries that you could buy.
"Amazon Basics. I am so glad these are part of the basics. I love these batteries. I get equal or better performance as you might expect from Duracel or Energizer. The benefit is that I pay less. Every single time I walk past batteries in a store I think, Amazon Basics and then like Vector from Despicable Me, I can hear, Oh YEAH!"
"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again."
I needed batteries and after having read and seen so many positive reviews I bought my first batch of Amazon Basics batteries. I was an Energizer girl and was very skeptical of trying another brand as other attempts proved unworthy. I am very pleased by the quality endurance of these batteries! I started with AAA and they worked so well that I bought AA when I needed more. The price can't be beat either! These batteries serve their purpose well and last a long time - the best bang for the buck that I have found!
"I bought the batteries because of good reviews. I checked the voltage on several of the batteries, and they were fine. I have not had the batteries in use long enough to comment further."
The batteries work but not well or for long for anything that requires a lot of power. I bought these for flame-less candles and they are perfect for that. But when I tried to use them in a child's toy they batteries died very quickly.
GREAT BATTERIES and even Better PRICE!!!I will definitely order more when I run out.
You can never go wrong with Inexpensive batteries that are delivered right to your door and last just as long if not longer than the national brands. From cameras to flash lights and toys these batteries last the test of time.
"Since I have bought these batteries, I do not feel like I am changing batteries as often as I were before using Rayovak. I will say however they do not last more than a couple days of hard play on the XBOX one controllers."
So far so good
I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.
"I should be a better citizen of the environment and use rechargeable batteries. I should, but I am not doing that. Instead, I'm buying the disposable ones like it's still 1985. If you're like me and are lazy and stupid, these will serve you well. Good value, standard batteries, etc etc. They aren't saving the earth or anything, but they are good functional batteries."
I purchased these batteries because of the price and the backing of Amazon. I figured Amazon wouldn't put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in an application and all 12 failed within a few days. Other batteries lasted months. For now I'll stay away from this product and fork out a few more bucks for a battery from a main stream manufacturer.
"I found these batteries great, shipped on time, as advertized, good expiration dates, well packaged. I am puzzled by Amazon's refusing to ship more while investing what it claims are reports of problems. The reviews show overwhelmingly postive responses with 5 negative. I see Amazon happily offering many products with far worse stats. What is the story here When will the 'investigation' be over (Should the FBI be called in ) )"
Fantastic value for a great quality battery !
"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing"
These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed
"It's a bunch of batteries, I have always had good luck with these batteries, All I know is you put them into the device it works"
I have been buying the bulk AA and AAA 'AmazonBasics batteries for some time now. They are delivered wrapped in groups of four and in a cardboard box. I have NEVER had a problem with any of them.
I have been using Amazon Basics products for about 2 years and have always found them to be first rate. The batteries last as long as the name brand batteries and cost a lot less.
"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work."
"I have not yet determined the useful life of these when in use. I installed four in my camera last week. I just do not know how long they will last, but they look good"
"Can not beat the price, since I got them, I started replacing some batteries. It's been several weeks, and I've had no issues with performance, and so far they seem to last just as long as name brand batteries that you would pay the same amount of money for and only get 4 batteries."
"I like how they are organized in the box into packs of 4. The box further separates them into groups and great to keep for storing them in. Batteries seem to work just fine. PLUS, they is cheap."
The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the timer to 8 hours on each.
Cheap! I like it.
"I like the heavy card board box they come in. The strength (AAA, AA, C, etc) is printed on the side of the box. This gives you the ability to stack your batteries in a common 'emergency equipment' location so you know where to go when you need one. With the plainly marked sides, you can instantly see which box you want. This will gladly replace our current system: open a package of batteries, take 1 or 2, then put the rest back - someplace. We have batteries all over the place: some in in baggies, some loose in drawers, some still in their original packaging."
"In my opinion, works just as well as all the top name brand ones. I didn't perform any fancy tests, but I will buy them again."
As good as the copper ones for much less money. I got tired of paying through the nose for small packages of batteries at my local Wally World. It is nice to have a brick of batteries available. I actually used up half the box just getting everything stocked with new batteries. I liked them so much that I ordered the AAA and D cell boxes. As long as Amazon keeps making quality products for less money they will continue to take over the world.
I love how efficiently Amaozon packages their batteries. They seem to hold up comparably to other name brand batteries. Also they are so inexpensive!
This pack of batteries is affordable and power-packed. I use these for my Tamiya collection it lasts really long. I love it!
AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries...i love it !
"I love the fact that you can get such a nice quantity of batteries for such a low price. Huge savings over big-box and grocery stores, and with a family of 4 kids and their army of battery-hungry toys, this deal is a life-saver."
Best batteries I've ever used and much cheaper than drug store or other stores. I used to buy other brands for much more and tried these and they are awesome.
These have some major juice! I love them! Long lasting and a kick-bootie price!!
I love these for the price I haven't noticed any difference between these and the major brands. but they are definitely better than Kodak and store brands I have tried.
"I love these! I have them in black and the coral. Very comfortable. I wouldn't workout in them as the waistband is not snug, but do wear them around the house and when out running errands. Lightweight and wearable on warmer days."
"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC"
I mean..batteries They work.
"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer."
"I use lots of AAA batteries. I got a lot for the price. I like the neat way they were packaged. How long will the last At this price, it doesn't really matter"
"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss."
I put these in some battery powered candles for a surprise harry potter b day for my girlfriend. We hung the candles from the ceiling. That was three months ago...the candles are still burning!
"I ran my own longevity test and have the results. I have 4 identical candles, battery operated on a timer and sitting on the same table. I wondered myself which battery would last the longest. I put a EverReady battery in one, Rayovac battery, one AmazonBasics battery and one Maxell battery purchased from amazon.com. They were all purchased within a week of each other (thanks for friends and family that each donated two battery). The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the timer to 8 hours on each. After 25 days I had my first failure. The Rayovac candle didn't turn on. At day 26 the Maxell battery failed. and at day 27 the EverReady failed to turn on my candle. Along came day 27 - five hours into the 8 hour set timer and the AmazonBasics didn't make my candle work. I know this isn't a 'scientific' test but satisfied me as to which battery I will be buying from now on and those friends and family will now also be buying AmazonBasic Performance Alkaline Batteries."
"I really like Amazon batteries. I think they work just as well as any of the other brands, but at a much better price point."
"UPDATE June 2016Batteries do not last long at all. I am using mostly for wireless mouse. 1 battery last approx. 2-3 weeks. In my humble opinion, that is terrible. I retract my previous review.PREVIOUS REVIEW:Fantastic price, wonderful reliable product. I am a tried and true believer and purchaser."
"There are many batteries in the box for the amount of money you pay. Batteries at the store would cost way more. They seem to be packaged well, and conveniently. I took one star off because these batteries do not seem to last as long as the more expensive batteries, but it could just be the pack that i used. I will see how the rest will work out, but for the money, i think it is a good deal."
"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."
WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
I use batteries for low drain electronics like hand held GPS. Tested these against Duracell copper tops and was surprised that the Amazon Basics last longer than Duracell. 24 hours vs 21. Not a huge difference but they are 1/2 the price:)
Really high value batteries. I use them for my wireless mouse and they works fine.
"Cheap AAA batteries! Haven't had any issue with them so far, I use them in stuff like... my nose hair trimmer."
good battery life and pays to buy in bulk
"I use these on my Xbox one controllers. For the price they are quite a steal. I haven't really noticed a difference in battery life over other batteries. They get the job done, and I will definitely be using these batteries for the foreseeable future"
"I used two of these recently and they worked very well. On long term use, I('m not sure. Thanks Amazon Calvin"
Never disappointed.
This product was exactly as promised. I was pleased with the price and would purchase these batteries again.
These batteries were expired dead when they arrived at my house. I was very disappointed.
"pleasantly suprised, i was worried they would run out quickly but they work great"
"I was expecting them to last as long as crappy walmart batteries. They last better than the Ikea ones! I love them, great deal!"
DID NOT LAST LONG
i won't buy batteries from home depot etc. anymore because these are equal quality to the well known brands and they are much cheaper and don't require sawing through plastic to open.
this works well enough for the price point. I would recommend it if you are on a budget.
We have been using these batteries for quite some time and none has leaked and all our products are still working that they are in. I would recommend!
Works as intended. I would recommend!
Great deal. Batteries are perfect!
I miss the bunny with the drum.
I'm a huge fan of amazon so I figured I'd give these a shot. These have no life whatsoever. Even something as low-power as tv remotes they only last about 2 weeks tops.Spend the extra money and go with name brand.
Why spend money on overpriced batteries when you can get AmazonBasics! These batteries work great and are packaged so neatly for storage. I highly recommend ordering these.
"I'm getting better results from these batteries than I do from the name brand. If the truth be known, they are probably made by one of the name brands."
They don't last quite as long as regular batteries but long enough to still save money. I'm pleased with these batteries.
"I don't notice any difference between these batteries and premium brand name ones They seem to last just as long, and at a great price."
I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
Batteries were decent. They came well packaged. I'm unsure how good they are as my son needed to replace his batteries on his game zone often. Although i replaced the Duracell batteries as well.
"This is the way to buy batteries, especially if you have Prime. Here's how my thinking goes: Running short on batteries Go to Amazon and order these again. It's Basics."
I've used these exclusively for my two Xbox One controllers and have not tried any other batteries in them. They lasted for about 48 hours of play time before running out. That seemed quick to me but I don't have anything to compare it to. These were the right price. I will order again when I remember to order batteries before I need them.
once every other year and i never run out
"I have been a strong believer in Amazon batteries for years. If you do not feel like dealing with rechargeables, theirs are definitely the way to go. As good as any national brand in my opinion. Just another reason I love Amazon."
"If you have a prime, then this is a no brainer. Money-saver in the long run. Go ahead and buy!"
"I decided to give this 48 pack of AmazonBasics AA batteries a chance because with two kids I burn through batteries like crazy. First off the price was definitely better than buying even store brand batteries at a local store. It was definitely cheaper than buying brand name. I was really impressed with how they were packaged. They come in a nice little box with four batteries plastic wrapped together. I like that because the batteries stay nice and organized even once you open the package. The single packages inside are easy to open too. You just twist them and they break open so it's not like you have to grab scissors or a knife.As far as using them they work just fine. I'm no scientist so I've never sat down and done some experiment on these to track the use, but I can't tell the difference from when I was buying Duracell or Energizer or any other battery.We have used them in all kinds of kids toys, in remote controls and in our Xbox 360 controller. They seem to hold up well and I have not had any that did not work.Since I can't tell a difference in how they work or how long they last I will definitely get these since they are cheaper. And I like the packaging much better since I don't end up with batteries rolling all over our drawer where we keep them. Highly recommended!"
Good quality and price for families who have little kids (and lots of toys that constantly need new batteries!)
if you use batteries like I do I would recommend these. Much cheaper than buying locally and just as good if not better
"Each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouse.Update: the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast. Nevertheless, it would be good if these Amazon batteries stated their capacity."
"ill never run out of batteries again, well at least not for a while. i bought all these for christmas and they definitely came in handy for all the toys and items i bought my daughter, nieces and nephews for christmas"
"Amazon basics products seem to impress me at times. I bought this batteries because I need them and didn't wanna pay the extra . I used them on my remote controls, led flashlight etc. and I'm certain that it will do the job."
"Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries."
I only buy my batteries from Amazon. They are inexpensive and last a long time! Super impressed with their quality of batteries.
Inexpensive and they work perfectly.
"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."
received quickly with n o damages. This battery seems to be the same as all the other ones.
"Well, it is a good idea to stock up. I didn't do comparison to see if it was cost effective."
This is so so.it is doing good.i do not know how long it can last.this is also pretty good.
It worked great I like it you can't beat the price you get a lot for your money
There... There batteries. It would be pretty hard to screw this one up
"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly."
Pretty good batteries and arrived early for my gaming mouse.
What can I say They are AAA batteries and I got them delivered in less than 24 hours. It's awesome!
You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It's better to buy Duracell.
Its a vey good and compact packaging.the batteries work awesome.I recommend it and would definitely buy them again
"These batteries are good, they last longer than the usual brands I use. Its nice"
Its OK. Not much life in the batteries.
These batteries are just a tiny bit too short to work in every AAA device. Beware.
Just as expected. We used them for the lazer tag guns and they guns are still going strong after two weeks of constant use.
"Just as good as leading brands, but alot cheaper. Will be buying more in the future."
Works just as good as the big brand names at a fraction of the cost. I have stopped buying big brands and buy amazon batteries exclusively. have not sat down and compared hour life but seem to be just as good.
Good batteries. Arrived just in time
What can I say - they work and last just as good as any other brand I have tried. I bought various sizes from Amazon and they all work great - just make sure you buy in advance to have them on hand for when you need them instead of running to the store forking over a lot more money for the same performance - I did buy the 9 volt box to replace all my fire alarms in the house - PERFECT!
"Absolute best value for standard batteries (especially when using subscribe and save). If you aren't seeking rechargeable, I haven't ever been able to distinguish any real difference in quality or longevity between these and other top brands of batteries (Duracell, Energizer, etc.).Between my kids toys and my Xbox controllers, we go through about all of these batteries in about 6 months, so subscribe and save is the way to go."
Work great. No complaints.
I might even say they're better than name brand based on the price and quantity you get. Use them in everything from kids toys to flashlights to gaming controllers.
"For the price, these can't be beat. I don't have scientific measurements, but these seem to last just as long in my mouse, keyboard, remote, etc. as the more expensive brands do, for a lot cheaper. I like having a lot on hand so that I don't run out and have to pay more for them at the store, so I order these in bulk in different sizes and I'm always prepared. Overall, I've had really good luck with the Amazon brand."
"what can I say, they hold up as good as the name brand batteries. Great product"
These seem to be every bit as good as the name brands. Have used them in many applications.
Good for the money.
"Batteries worked well, just as well as the store bought ones but at a better price"
Maybe I received a defective batch but these are so bad.No longevity at all. Used up within 2 weeks whereas the branded ones last 2 months!I will not purchase them again regardless of the lower cost.
"A nice size bulk pack of AAA batteries. Beats the prices of what walmart or target has. These are NOT rechargeable, seen some people asking if they were in the question box. Will do just fine for remotes, flash lights, kids toys etc."
"These come packaged into 4's, love that! I bought them specifically for the emergency lanterns I got and since they are packed separated into 4's I can put them with the lanterns perfectly. They work great and have had ZERO problems with these. Definitely recommend!"
For the deal on these you cannot beat the results. The battery is very similar to name brand batteries bought at local stores for twice the price.
You know these are just ok. They done last as long as the Copper top batterys.
"Don't seem to last as long as other batteries, you get what you pay for."
Great quality and super cheap! What else you can ask for
just trying
Met my expectations for Alkaline AAA. I would recommend these to a friend.
Just what I wanted.
"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."
"I've read that these don't last as long as some other brands, but so far, I haven't had any issues. I don't use batteries for anything constant, however, remotes to the television primarily. They work great for that, and they cost less than other brands. Win win."
"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!"
Cheap batteries and last about as long as the name brand batteries.
"We've been going through a lot of AAA sized batteries and have been able to verify that these Amazon Basics batteries last just as long as other name brand alkaline batteries from Duracell, Rayovac or energizer in low and steady drain devices. Due to the price advantage we will keep using these."
Came as described and actually last for quite a while.
"Everyone debates how long batteries last and these work perfectly fine. As a college student who spends a ton of time playing Xbox, my roomates and I went through batteries by the dozen and were always short. Instead of taking them out of any device we coud get our hands on (remotes, calculators, etc) we decided to just get these in bulk. They are much cheaper than getting anything in store and last long enough that we didnt notice a difference. A pair in an Xbox 360 controller lasted a good 4 months with almost daily use which is better than most batteries in my opinion."
"Last just as long or longer than the name brands! I game alot and have been using Duracell or energizer, whichever is on sale. Decided to try these and so far I feel like they have lasted longer than the name brands. Ill update if this changes"
First time trying the Amazon batteries and glad I did. These batteries have out lasted the Duracell batteries we used before and are cheaper! Will definitely purchase again.
Last longer than any Alkaline I have purchased. Performance Alkaline Batteries.
"Two batteries came with my amazon basics mouse i bought. I was suprised that it took two years for them to die. Definitely buying again, highly recommend."
Great Deal
"Awesome price! If there is a difference between these and the big name brand batteries, it's not a significant difference, because I can't tell. These seem to last just as long as the others in my opinion. Will always buy again!"
I was very surprised when the package arrived. These are AA batteries!
"I love these batteries because they are cost-effective and less expensive than buying smaller amounts of the same batteries at the store.These batteries last a long time, and it's nice to have them delivered!"
Great deal for long lasting batteries.
Works just as well as the top brands! Lasts a long time!
Fast shipping. Amazon basics last longer too. Been buying them for awhile
Way great battery! I love em. Cheap and last forever.
"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again."
Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.
"Bought these March 2015. It's now Feb 2017 and my son said his toy lightsaber had just stopped working. Opened it up and batteries have leaked causing corrosion to contacts. No longer works, even with new batteries. It's not a very expensive toy, but the 1 most important aspect of a battery is that it not leak. What's the point of saving a few dollars on batteries if they are going to ruin something much more expensiveWith major brands, you can send in leaked batteries and device for repair or refund. Although I've never done thisThe version I bought were silver and green, so perhaps they have changed.Leaked batteries had 1.46,1.46,1.25v respectively."
"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."
"I like these batteries, but a couple of times now after putting them in I have opened up the compartments to find battery acid leaking out inside, I figured it was just a one off, but it has now happened several times, I am reluctant to use them anymore in case I damage items"
"These batteries don't seem inferior to the more expensive Duracells and Energizer that we have been using. We have been using these primarily to go in our XBox One controllers, and they last a few weeks to a month with pretty consistent use, about the same as other AAs we have used. The price can't be beat, even cheaper than Costco at the time of purchase and with free shipping in hassle free packaging."
"Pro: Relatively inexpensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Cons: High drop-out rate. They come in packs of four when used in Nikon cameras it's not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to 1.48V while the fourth has dropped to...1.2V. They come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load."
"Life of battery varies with individual battery, which was disappointing. Maybe this is the difference between buying the house brand and buying the name brand--quality control."
"Yes life short, that's right"
Life span long...performance upto satisfaction. Reliable. No failure. Only performance.
"I will never need to buy batteries again. These are great , what I love is that they're not loose , they come together in packs of four."
I ordered these thinking they were rechargeable (I recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here) .. so when I received them and used them I was not surprised that they died VERY quickly. Upon attempting to recharge these I figured out they aren't rechargeable (Once again big duh on my part)..Now I'm seriously surprised that I'm only getting a few hours of use out of them!! like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer. Horribly disappointed.. I will go back to the name brand batteries for sure.
Really liked the batteries - seem to hold up well and keep a decent charge
These batteries seem to work as well as other brands at a much better price point.
"Good knob. Looks good. Logo faded/wore off in a few months though... logo is kinda why I bought this, so.........."
"Incredible deal for this prices, the batteries are long duration nice!"
Excellent Batteries
These batteries seem to last as long as the name brands you would purchase at the store. I have saved a lot of money by buying these in bulk instead of running to the store every time I need batteries. I am happy with these and will probably order more when I run out.
"THESE BATTERIES WORK JUST AS GOOD AS THE BRANDS YOU ALREADY KNOW, BUT DO NOT COST NEARLY AS MUCH MONEY. THATS A WINNER FOR ME."
"If you're looking for cheap but durable batteries look no further. I personally like amazon products. I know I can count on them as much as a named brand, but for a 1/4 of the price. I got these on Prime day for a great price and the last a OK amount of time. I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy. If you're looking to save money from the expensive name brands, go with a Amazon brand product its becoming more common and competitive as a name brand product."
Batteries work just as well as Duracell or whatever other name brand you can find at the stores. Long lasting and great quality. Will buy agian.
"I needed some AAA's and decided to go with these since I no longer have an acive COstco membership. So far these batteries have held up very well in my remotes, several headlamps, and tactical flashlights that I regularly use. Great purchase"
These batteries last as long if not longer than the top name brand.
Works better than any name brand I have ever used.
Perfect quality. These last a long time!
These are very good batteries. I highly recommend them.
Seem to have a great life to them. I'm impressed.
These do not corrode and have a long shelf life and generally work better than Cosco or any other brand except the course the lithium ones
"I actually got the AA batteries some months ago and have found them to be amazing. We have so many electronics and remotes, and it seems that really good batteries are always in need. Just wish our town would make it a little more obvious as to where we can safely dispose of them when they finally do wear out."
Incredibly happy with AmazonBasics batteries.. The price is amazing and they last just as long as more expensive brands. Prime 2 day shipping has been a life saver when the kids need batteries and I don't have time to run to the store! Another great from Amazon!
"I love all of the new AmazonBasics products, and these batteries do not disappoint. They seem to last so long, not like a discount battery at all. Happily, I have added them to my Subscribe and Save to stack an even bigger discount. I have yet to replace any of these, actually, now that I think about it! They seem to last a very long time, certainly as long as other major labels out there."
Same for these AA batteries as for the AAA batteries.
"It's batteries. No really, it's just batteries."
Great batteries! I have nothing negative I can say about this product. They work just as well as any name brand product you would buy off the shelf at any store except these are probably one quarter of the price.
Too soon to tell but they seem fine
"Cant beat the price for the amount of batteries you get. Much cheaper than store prices, will buy again. Works just as good as brand name."
Lots of batteries and nice to have on hand. Best price for a bundle.
So far so good as far as batteries go. I order them under subscribe and save. Makes the price even better and we always have plenty for our toddler.
A lot of batteries for the price. Solid deal.
As advertised!
Great replacement for the expensive batteries
I WILL BUY IT AGAIN
Very good
"Love it , no better deals on the net"
These are great
"These batterys last just as long as any other name brand, they are good."
"Have been buying AmazonBasics batteries ever since they were introduced years ago. Lasts as long, if not longer than Energizer and Duracell for a fraction of the cost. Also, love the packaging: I store them in their box and it's so convenient to get to them when I need them."
Great batteries and great the price is great to I will almost definitely buy these again.
Love the price and quality. The quality is really good too. Ordered these for my office and figured I'd stock up at home for the price. They come packaged really well. I can always use extra batteries!
Love the price of these batteries. They don't last as long as bigger brands like Duracell or energizer but you get a lot of batteries for not a lot of money so I love it.
Great packaging!
Love these batteries.
I buy these batteries in for my indoor/outdoor flickering candles....love them for the quality and price!
"In comparison to the name brand batteries, these are just as reliable. I cannot notice a difference between these batteries and the name brand batteries. Love them!"
Love this batteries. Better price and good batteries. I can't tell the difference between them and the big name brands.
"Love this candle. When lights are turned out, it truly looks like a real candle. I bought 2 more and will probably get a few more for Christmas gifts."
Said it once and I'll say it again. Love Amazon batteries! Haven't beaten the price yet!
Great quality for price
"Great price, great battery life, great look, just great, love it :D"
"Been using Amazon AA and AAA batteries over the past 6 months in a variety of electronic items and have found that they do not last as long as higher quality, higher price batteries. I guess you get what you pay for!"
"Looks like these will be good for lower drain, standby applications, where battery leakage is a concern. I have given up on the Costco brand as they tend to leak in these types of applications. While overall watt-hour density is average, still good for remotes, and common applications. It's hyped about Japanese technology, but not made in Japan."
These batteries perform just as well as the big name brands and for a fraction of the cost.
"I am extremely disappointed with these batteries, which stems not from longevity or power, but with fit. Almost immediately upon receiving them I installed them into three electric candles. No joy. I cleaned the contacts, still no joy. I tested the batteries, full charge. Just for grins, I installed into one candle three Ray-O-Vac brand batteries, and the candle lit with no problem. Removed the Ray-O-Vacs, installed the Amazons, and again, no joy. I repeated this a couple of times with the same results. And I tried this in the other two candles with identical results: All three candles lit with the Ray-O-Vacs, none with the Amazons. Knowing the issue was not with candles, I took a Ray-O-Vac and lined it up with an Amazon, and discovered something interesting: the batteries were just a wee bit different.The length of the positive terminals are different, just a tad longer on the Ray-O-Vac (see picture). The Ray-O-Vac terminal is taller (longer) while the Amazon terminal is squat-tier and therefore shorter. The difference in length is tiny, no question: but when you're putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with, that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not. I'll keep the Amazons to use in devices (mice, for example) that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance (or a stronger spring) to hold the battery firmly in place. I am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device (that may not force as firm a connection) or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the get-go, use a branded-name battery.I am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of Amazon Basic computer cables (among their first products in the Basics line), but was recently disappointed with another item I purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line (that being dog house-training piddle pads, which have not proven as absorbent as similarly-priced products, and I've bought a lot of different brands). The batteries were my second foray into Basics product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-cables arena, and now I'm 2 for 2 in the disappointed column. I never thought there was a difference in batteries, and now I know differently. The next time I see a Duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability, I'll think back to this experience, as I will when selecting batteries in the future. I so wanted to like these Amazon batteries, too."
I use these in my Bluetooth gaming chair's transmitter that uses 2 AAA's. Approximate battery life is 50+ hours. Incredible!
"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries."
I bought them to go into a flashlight. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. maybe good for things like remote controls
"Lasted one month in my carbon monoxide detector. Maybe these are good for other applications, but disappointed with their performance."
"Can't beat the price for all these batteries. Why would people go to local store and pay exorbitant prices for batteries which you can get at a cheaper price. Maybe they last as long say for instance like Duracell or Eveready but for the price of an off brand, it is still well worth it."
These are decent cheap batteries but they don't last as long as Eveready Or Duracell or Rayovac. they really are only good enough for remotes and the like. I don't like to use them in anything else.
Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.
"These do not last nearly as long as a name brand battery. So considering the cost/benefit, i'm not really sure if they are any better"
They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Lowes are way better.
Great bang for the buck. Amazon batteries....Who knew
"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shopper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remotes that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. So, finding some that were affordable was necessary to keep everyone happy."
"I can never have enough batteries. We use them so quickly, I love to have extra boxes. These were a good price and they seem to work well."
Great deal on these! Seem to have more initial power than most alkalines. Great for my electric razor! Get them if you have kids with lots of toys that eat batteries!
"Great, but would like higher rating rechargeables."
Worked well. I got these for some remote control mice I had purchased. Much fun was had scaring the office staff.
Cant beat these batteries.
"So far, so good. My new source for batteries. I love me some Amazon"
These are now my go-to batteries....sorry copper top. I used them for lights at my daughter's wedding and they are still going strong!
Best way to have electronics work is having them be charged or have batteries! Buying this pack will fix the needing batteries part!
My son goes through batteries like crazy so I bought him this pack for his birthday no complaints and they last a lot longer than dollar store batteries.
"Name-brand batteries are great. But, they do cost a bit more than lesser-known battery brands. Amazon may not be known for their batteries, but they have a good name. And if they are going to put their name on a product I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that the product will work well. So far, so good - with these batteries. Good price... arrived quickly... and, are working fine. Whether they last as long as other brands I have yet to discover."
stock up on these at a great price.
These we got for the flashlight for a birthday party. They work.
I have no qualms about the quality of these batteries.I only wish that every 4 batteries were not individually wrapped.
"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far."
I have these on the subscribe and save listNever had any issues with old batteries or out-of-dateevery order has been perfect.My only small gripe is they seem do not last very long.But value wise they still beat buying name brandsI.D. (Indiana Dan)
Good to have A batteries at such a good price
This box of batteries was a great value. Better than buying from the other box stores. I like how they came in an easy to open cardboard box. Each set of 4 inside the box is wrapped in a thin layer of plastic so the batteries don't roll around and make a mess. I used these to replenish all my kids' talking/lightup toys...as those toys don't generally work well with rechargables. I'm going to buy more of these as needed!
These batteries are less expensive and have more charge than most store-bought batteries. You'd have to be insane to not buy them.
So far so good
The package just arrived and all seems well. I have no information on the life of these batteries. If they do well I would be glad to give them 5 stars.
Put together mobile but it refuses to turn. Kind of pointless. Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable.
good batteries
Great batteries
Great batteries for a great price
great price - perfect for what I needed it for
"Love these batteries, would buy again!"
Needed some decent batteries. Gets the job done.
These are good batteries
Works great
"These don't last quite as long as Duracell, but for the price it's hard to complain. Nice basic batteries. No issues except for slightly shorter lifespan."
"This is my second batch. These batteries are perfect for what I needed. In my experience, they seem to be just as good as the more expensive name brands."
"Nice batteries, good price!"
"Nice box, good price. Only improvement would be to eliminate the 4pack wrapping. The clear plastic wrap seems like an unnecessary step when changing our kids toy batteries"
These work very well and are priced well. Just as good as Duracell or Everteady or other major brands.
Packaged nicely.
Great price and work great. They come in a sturdy box and are wrapped as 4 packs in plastic.
I like that I can order these on-line with Prime shipping directly to my house in a few days. I use a lot of batteries during the holidays starting with Halloween through Easter. Not a bad price and they seem to last awhile.
"Bought these on Amazon for a good price, but they just don't seem to last very long. The packaging and batteries look nice. None of them leaked, but that could be because I went through them so fast."
Cheap Batteries! Nice!
Great deal great product!
NICE. WORKED GREAT. DID THE JOB.
"Some of the best batteries I've ever bought. Last a long time, and VERY nicely packages. Batteries are individually packaged into packs of 4 so that is very nice."
Seems as good as the ones in the store.
"These batteries last as long as many of the name brands. They are packaged in sets of 4 in a sturdy box, and the individual packages are easy to open. No complaints in regards to price and longevity of use as I'm getting the same amount of use out of things like my battery operated mouse as I would with a name brand."
"I would say these are better than the cheaper name brands ... But, not as good as the high dollar name brands. They fall in the middle, and for the price you really can't complain!!"
"they're batteries, they're cheap, and they work just fine"
"These batteries work great! No issue with battery life. I order this pack every few months to keep up with our computer mouse, video game controllers, and misc battery needs. Can't beat the price."
No complaints here! Very satisfied with these batteries. So far I've used them primarily in LED candles and they've worked great basically on continuously. I think they are comparable to the Kirkland brand that I normally use. I will buy again.
No complaints.
So far so good. I'll buy all my batteries from Amazon basics in the future.
I wanted solar batteries.
Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.
Put 18 of the batteries in devices already and they all work. Fast delivery no issues
They last as long as Rayovac batteries.
They work great and a price nicely
"These batteries worked just fine and unlike the last Energizer batteries, they didn't leak. I'll never buy Energizer again."
These batteries do not last long. I put some in a portable can opener and was able to open about 10 cans.
Good Deal for the price
Cannot beat the price. High performance to cost ratio. I did not do any drain test but used them on xbox controllers and seem to last just as long as Duracell or Costco batteries. Free shipping makes it 5 stars.
"No problem with these batteries. They get used in various remotes, USB devices and other low-wattage draw items, so it is hard to say how well they will last. However, I have not had an issue to date. Will buy again."
No problems. Expectations met. No fuss.
"Best battery buy in town. So far, no duds. I have been buying for the last 3 years and worth the price."
"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas."
"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose."
"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Fast , good delivery."
"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radios.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Noqw I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys."
Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.
These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. Go with a good brand name.
"Don't last quite as long as name brand, but worth the money."
These batteries leaked into my mouse and killed it. Not cool Amazon.
Certainly not as good as Duracell. Some are very good........ others go bad in as little as two weeks. I put 3 in a plugged-in weather radio to serve as battery back up. Got a message that batteries needed replacing after only 2 weeks. A battery tester confirmed that they should be replaced. I guess I will go back to the Duracells.
"Bought these for my digital camera based on a semi-professional review. Each set of 2 lasted less than an hour in my camera. Have used other brands of regular AA batteries and they have lasted much longer. If it's cameras you're buying them for, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
"Great battery, great price. NOT frustration-free though. Each row of 4 batteries was wrapped up so you had to open 12 packs individually."
These worked for about a week. Then started leaking and just stopped working. I ended up throwing them away. I even had to throw a string of lights out because of the leaks of batteries.
"ehh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it."
Good Value but they dont last very long
I will not purchase these again. They last about 1/2 the life of the Duracell ones.
"These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remotes, clocks, battery-powered soap dispensers. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basics. Bought duracells at Costco. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. Don't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing."
Great price for batteries and they work!
I thought from the reviews that I had found a really good battery for less money than I usually paid for DuraCell but I was wrong. I put these in a my battery operated Halloween decorations and they lasted exactly 3 weeks on a 4 hour timer mode. The pumpkins where I used DuraCell are still glowing brightly. Guess it's back to the other brand for my battery operated Christmas decorations.
These batteries don't seem to last quite as long as regular brand name.
Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.
Not suitable for toys. Drained within just a couple of days.
I use these all the time. They have come in handy for a few remotes that we have gotten and only used these sized batteries. They last a decent amount of time. Not the greatest but also for the size they work well.
"Definitely not Duracell, but it gets the job done. Last for a while, but died sooner than expected."
"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before."
Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.
"About the same as Ray O Vac, not very good."
These batteries were horrible. They died with a couple of days use. I figured since they were Amazon brand they would be good but I was mistaken. Sorry I would not recommend these to anybody.
Not worth a crap don't waist your money. I purchased these for under cabinet lighting and they hardly have enough power. The light is way more dim than other batteries.
"This batteries didn't last very long in anything we used them in (clock, toy, flashlights). Would not buy them again."
They simply do not last very long. Not worth the money.
"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)"
Just ok
"In a world where AA Alkaline Batteries are essentially obsolete, these batteries by AmazonBasics get the job done. I used these for a Logitech wireless mouse and they have worked fine. Overall, I would recommend these batteries to anyone looking for both performance and value."
"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac."
Just batteries. Nothing special or bad about them.
"Usually I buy bricks of batteries from Fry's Electronics, but I had an Amazon gift card, so I figured I would give them a shot and they make my devices work!"
Obviously they are excellent batteries where you can get them in a very nice small package so it is not taking up much room. The batteries themselves work as well or better than other brands that I have purchased. I only purchase AmazonBasics Alkaline Batteries for all the sizes that we need.
These perform as well as your typical name brand batteries at a lesser price. I'll continue to buy these in lieu of the more expensive ones.
Long lasting cheap batteries what more do you ent
good deal
How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!
not what I was looking for but they are ok.
OK
ok
They seem fine to me.
Pretty good but the batteries do get used up fairly quickly. I use them for wireless mics and they last for maybe 5 or 6 hours TOPS. I need to compare them with Duracell to really get an idea of their quality.
"I have a digital charger that has been very effective at recharging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a recharge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxell and others, I expected a more robust container."
Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.
"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK."
Worked great!
"I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on."
They work greatcame very late though
Package arrived with one battery missing :(
The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.
Serves the purpose. Good for the price.
a few in the lot didn't work at all.
All were dead
almost most of the batteries drained out in 1 or 2 weeks with moderate use
Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak
"Bad quality, many of the batteries were blank, not charged. Some only lasted for a week or so."
Batteries are awful. Might get 1/4 the life other batteries Ive used. Will not be buying Amazon batteries again.
Batteries did not last more than two days
batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed
Batteries must be old don't work!
"batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month"
BRUTAL! THEY DONT LAST LONG AT ALL!
Dangerous
Die way too fast
Do not last near as long as other 'off brand' batteries
Does not last as long as the good batteries
don't last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months.
Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option.
Horrible batteries. So far every battery we have used hasn't worked!!!
I updated my credit car d more than six weeks ago. I won't bother you in the future.
I was missing a pack of 4 batteries when I opened the box today. Not impressed.
I'm truly disappointed with these batteries
Inconsistent. VERY short life.
Junk wont charge
Just what I needed - thank you
LOVE THE BATTERIES.THANKS
never again. don't last. especially short life in cold weather.
No good...worthless. I have no use for them.
None of the batteries work
"Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return."
poor quality
Returned for later purchase
Run down very quickly!
should buy duracell
Terrible battery life!!!!
That's crap
The package was open and missing two batteries.
These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.
"These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast"
these batteries do not last long and we have quite a few that are leaking..
these batteries do not perform as good as the cheapest ones on the market.
These die way too fast.
These suck. Had for a week. Stopped working. Garbage.
theses batteries don't last very long not worth the money
they are terrible
they do not last at all would love to get my money refunded.
They paired these with a order that uses AA
Total crap. Batteries last for minutes.
Used these for 2 insta bulb lights purchased from here also and they last about a week. Crazy!!!
"Utterly worthless, no staying power."
Wore out way to fast
Worst battery I've ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!!
Wrong Item
I only buy batteries from Amazon. Love the Duracell Procell deals but the Amazon branded batteries seem just as good. No way can I score these deals locally.
only 4 stars need 5 or 6 years to prove there leak proof. Tip Duracell's have destroyed far too many of my devices.
Not much to say about batteries but I really love the Amazon Basics products. Great price and same performance as Duracell or similar popular brands.
What can I say here. These batteries are fantastic. I'll never pay for brand name batteries again. This is the only way to go!!!
Do not leave these batteries sitting on a dresser... or pretty much anywhere you don't want battery acid leaked onto. We took the batteries out of our remote at night and woke up to our brand new 3500 dresser ruined. Awesome.
Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
"Best price for a none name brand battery, however, they last just as long as name brands for a pack of batteries."
I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.
"Great price, long lasting and got to my home very fast!"
"Great batteries for an outstanding price! Order here, not through your local store - you'll regret it! It's nothing better than having a drawer full of batteries, too, for those last-minute needs!"
"Haven't used them, they look fine. Probably overpaid. They arrive in a fancy cardboard box, like they're collectibles or something."
There were 2 batteries missing from the pack. Just annoying enough to write a bad review. Not annoying enough to do anything else about it...
This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.
These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk
A++
Another brilliant amazonbasics product. Works better then the brand name batteries and last longer.
As good as any other battery brand on the market
"Cheap, Well-made, great deal!"
Excellent
Inexpensive and works great!! We plow through batteries with three kids and every damn toy that is battery driven.
Item as described. Fast delivery. Perfect.
Perfect! I used them for almost everything.
"Great batteries, exactly what we needed. Thanks for the bulk pack, it was perfect."
Perfect choice for the kids electronics! They go through batteries so quickly these are cost effective and last just as long as the expensive ones
"Perfect for our emergency survival basement pantry. I haven't opened the box, and just sealed them in plastic."
"Excellent value. These come packaged in little sleeves of four in a large cardboard box. Amazon Basics batteries have always been good performers. We've been using them for a couple of years and haven't had any issues with them drying up quickly or being lackluster upon first use. Nice quality, great deal."
"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk."
"We got these for our TV remote. We didn't need such a large package, but it was the cheapest option, so we went ahead and purchased the 20 pack. It was great to be able to save money over the name brands, and since it was Amazon brand, we figured they would be good quality (and we were right). It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed."
You can trust Amazon to bring you great products at great price
So far batteries are good
Any parent of toddlers knows that there are numerous toys that require AAA batteries. We have these always on hand and this price is too good to not stock up. My son even loves sitting down and watching the whole Changing batteries process. Thanks for keeping these so affordable!
"Just Came In Today, Half Of Them Already In Use. Frustration Free Packaging (As Described). Great Price. Would Recommend."
Perfect!
These batteries are great and long lasting. I refilled every little flashlight and wish I had more to spare.
Hard to beat for the price. Shipped fast and fresh.
"Work great, and at an affordable price."
These are different than the ones pictured. Are these performance ones also
"As a mommy to 2 little ones, we go through a lot of batteries around here. Toys require batteries. The baby's vibrating music player requires batteries. And heaven forbid that the baby's music player runs out of batteries!I bought these batteries after reading the good reviews. I'm very impressed that these seem to perform just as well as the Duracell batteries that I normally buy. I haven't noticed any difference in performance or duration. And AmazonBasics are about half the price of the Duracell batteries. Thank you for helping me save money, AmazonBasics!"
Great batteries at a great pricr
"Cant beat it.. performs just as good if not better than the big brands, at more than half the cost.. Life span is awesome thus far.. ill never buy from the big guys again."
Pleasantly surprised with these batteries. Powered my son's toy tablet quite well along with other remote control cars that they use.
Poor life. Buy a known brand.
Batteries seem to have very short life.........
"Multiple batteries leaked, ruining one toy and causing messes in other items. Poor quality."
They are batteries people! They make things work for awhile.
Great price. The batteries last a long time also.
"Great pricing, FAST shipping and proud to fly and promote the AMAZON brand I love! Thank you for another outstanding product."
So far these have worked great and fit the need well.
These batteries work as I expected.
"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying!"
I did a simple test with 2 identical falmeless candles that run on 2 AAs. Amazon Basics AA kept the candle going as long and bright as brand new Energizers. Pretty darn good deal!!
Great cheap batteries. No more over paying for them!
"Good price, time will tell on durability"
price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up..
Order these regularly. Work very well. Price is great as with 3 kids replacing batteries often.
Cheap durable and lasting the only time I'm going to buy batteries here from now on Amazon
Would buy again.
Priced well and work great.
I haven't even used one yet but I suspect they will work. I stocked up on these because I have a lot of stuff that uses AAA's and it is a super price.
"These batteries are nothing special. They do the job, probably not as good as some name brands but good enough for my wireless trackball."
Order got lost and took longer (weeks) than expected. Product is great though.
So far so good testing fully charged
"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."
Quality batteries.
"I purchased AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading brands out there. They are also much more affordable. We have used them in everyday items that need batteries. We mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. This pack has lasted awhile."
I bought these basically because they are by Amazon and I love and trust their brand to produce high quality products. So I bought packs of AA and AAA when I bought some flashlights on Prime Day. They seem to work great and I expect they will last a long time.
Easy to open and store . . . equivalent battery life with more expensive brands!For those of us who do not like 'real' shopping These are Amazon Prime 2 day delivery.
Unbeatable price for the amount you get. Quality batteries.
Great batteries. Work and last like brand name batteries
"Super buy alkaline AA batteries, Checked the 1.5 volts rating and actually read 1.61 volts which indicates its good and new. I was satisfied with my purchase and its very low price compared to other brands of same batteries. I used 4 and works as intended."
Work as good as any name brand batteries and a great deal. Not much else to say.
To be honest...these batteries outperformed a big name brand. Period.
Price was very good and I received the order in one day.
Great deal for our office's most popular battery.
Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with AA size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them! I tried it once before and pretty much melted down the item and destroyed the batteries as well. Apparently they are not made to supply as much current and they will let out the (magic) smoke. These came in quickly and are just what I needed
I saw reviews for batteries on the news and these were rated among best. I'm so glad I can get these from Amazon in bulk for a great price.
"Hope the feedback, review and pictures I post here will help a few fellow Amazon shoppers:Quality 10/10 Freakin Amazon man! Never letting us down. They're build solid and come in a safe and secure packaging. Also work great too.Price 9/10 Price isn't dirt-cheap but it's not expensive either. I've seen worst at the local stores or gas stations. AmazonBasics has good deals.Check out the pictures I uploaded here as well.Let me know if you have any questions / if my review, feedback and pictures helped you shop!"
These last about 5 hrs in a roku remote using the headphones. Really disappointed in how long they last.
Best battery deal ever. Lasts a long time
These are a great price based on others I've seen. They additionally have a very good life cycle based on individual price point as compared to more expensive brands.
"Reasonably priced, and I have had no issues. They are not eneloops, but they work fine for all the applications that I have used them in."
Both packs were useless. Confirmed low charge with multimeter.
These batteries are just fine and does the job. Would recommend!
These work good and are just as efficient as top name in comparison this far.
They seem to work well and with a 10 year shelf life why buy in two and 4 packs when you can save money like this.
"Work very well, lots of power."
Good price on batteries with good life. Works as long as other name brands. recommended
"Great price for many batteries. I will now buy their AA's. Rated great by CU, and all work fine so far and all test fine. Recommended."
Great value.
Great value and lightning fast delivery!
"Product works as advertised, no issues. Recommended."
Good quality
"When I heard one of the consumer gurus on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the generic or lesser known brands of batteries were often as good as the name brands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other brands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosion. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries."
"I have switched to AmazonBasics brand after trying just about every brand there is. Good, reliable batteries."
"Quality and battery life is the same as name brand. Reminds me of the days when you could go to Radio Shack and get some good, inexpensive batteries. So far, I haven't had an AmazonBasics products I haven't liked."
Long lasting product good bang for your buck.
"Batteries that work that are cheap! Boom, sold. Buy them now AND NEVER LOOK BACK."
These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...
"Given its price, probably makes sense but doesn't last very long even with lower power usage or lesser used devices. I'd spend few dollars more and buy Duracell pack from Costco."
"These batteries are safe for children, because it features an anti-leakage style. Plus, it's eco-friendly so it's not just good for your child, buy also in your surrounding."
"I love the concept of Amazon basics. I look forward to the savings that can be passed to consumers (hopefully) by stripping out a lot of the non-sense associated with consumer products (marketing, packaging, etc.) I see no difference between these and brand name batteries other than the cheaper prices."
"Perfectly suitable alternative to the overpriced Duracell and Energizer batteries. I didn't notice any difference in performance, and I will never buy the expensive brands again after finding Amazon Basics!"
"So far they're holding up just like the brand name versions, but they're much cheaper."
These seem to be performing well so far. I've already gone through half. I haven't done any special tests to compare them to more name brand batteries but so far I've not had any issues. My daughter drained one of her video games in about the same time as she does with some of the other brands - but I didn't time it or anything. All of them were there - came nicely packaged and I like the price. I will most likely continue to buy these batteries now for the convenience and lower price.
"Cheap, works, better quality then duracel."
"Don't seem to last as long as the big name brands, however, for the price you will get more run time per money spent."
"These batteries work as long, if not longer, than the big name batteries. I love them! I swear by them in my remotes for my TV, sound system, Blu-Ray player, TiVo, and Roku!"
"I love the money Amazon brand saves us, these batteries work and last just as well as name brand!"
These are excellent batteries and the price is right.
"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."
Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.
"They are batteries, so can't say I love them! But I've had good results with Amazon's AA's so trying these now."
"I'm not entirely pleased with Amazon's batteries. It seems to me that these have been dying faster than the bulk pack I got at Costco long back (which lasted a long time!). I don't think I'll get these again, I'm returning to the name brands at Costoco once these are used up (and they are getting used up at a rapid pace)."
"Seem to work as well as the big brands at half the cost, no brainer buy. I'm about to get the AAA batteries."
"seems just as good as higher-priced batteries. I have had good experience with an AmazonBasics wireless mouse I've been using for 1 1/2 years, and the reviews for these batteries are excellent. For the price, I am fully satisfied."
"expiration of 2026, about 9 years in advance of when I received these.Batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of 5 which is good to provide for protection from discharge after part of the package is opened."
"I ordered a 20 pack of AA batteries from amazon when they were on sale. Seems like my kids are going through batteries like crazy with their gaming controllers and such. My household ends up going through AA batteries like there is no tomorrow! So when i saw these were on sale, i had to order some. I decided to hide these ones from the kids, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. So far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his xbox controller for days now and they are still going strong. Same with the wii controller- which has a battery indicator even, still says full battery. So far, i am very happy with these batteries and plan to purchase more in the future!"
Seems to be a good product. not sure they have a very long life.
One of my 48 batteries arrived with what looks like a leak. The rest look fine so I'll just keep them. Otherwise these batteries work just fine.
"Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with."
short battery life
"Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I'm always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired."
These batteries do not have a long life.
They really don't last very long
Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don't waste your money.
"We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don't waste your money, Buy Duracell instead."
"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it."
"So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term."
"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one."
"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."
"should have bought the bigger pack, used most of these up already, forgot how much stuff I had that uses AAA batteries."
"Nice bag, however did not come with the shoulder strap, which is one of the main reasons I wanted this particular model."
"Excellent long lasting batteries ,put all the expensive stuff to shame, SHIPPED IN AWESOME LITTLE AMAZON BOX ......."
"I like these shoes but Altra needs to pay more attention to sizing. I normally wear US 7.5-8. The first pair of Superior 2.0s I ordered was size 8 and they were way too short. OK, I thought, they run short. I ordered a pair size 8.5 and they were just barely long enough.I ordered a second pair size 8.5 and they are visibly half an inch shorter than the first size 8.5 pair. That isn't running short, it's lack of quality control.I really like these shoes, so I am ordering size 9's. But I do not have any warm feelings about Altra."
The package is A LOT smaller than I thought. That'snice.
Same soap as always but a smaller size than I thought.
So far so good
So far so good. Will update if anything changes.
So far so good. Working well with my light mirror and it's been holding a good amount of power for a good amount of time.
Time will tell how well they perform. They are a little less expensive than Energizer and if they perform as well I'll re-order them.
Price is right. So far so good for quality!
So far so Good !
An updated review past my initial use of these will be forthcoming. So far so good.
No issues thus far. I just started using them so I speak for their longevity.
They work. So far so good.
"So far so good. Great value. Well packaged, nice clean design and arrived quickly."
So far so good. The batteries are working great. I do like how they are packaged in groups of 4 inside a box. It keeps them in order once you remove a bundle or two.
"Bought for camping batteries, so far so good. .. we'll see if there are any issues after storing for a few months. Amazing price."
So far so good...good value overall time will tell how long they will last but will update if they don't last as long as name brands
I'm using three now and so far they're good. I love the flat sturdy box they came. Perfect for storing. Also a lot more batteries than I realized. :-)
I have been using these batteries for about a month now and the half I have used have performed very well. The Batteries I inserted into 3 items when they arrived are still working.So far I have found no bad batteries included in my order.Would recommend based on performance of the batteries I have used so far.
"So far, so good!"
"So far, so good. I haven't had them in a device long enough to report on actual battery life."
"So far, so good. They all seem fully charged and last as expected."
Enough batteries to power my remote for a decade. I would have loved this many AAs for my Gameboy growing up.
Works great in my xbox controllers and wii controls!
not long lasting move on pay more get more
"So, I now have an angry 2 year old. A broken new toy. And batteries that I cannot trust. I put new batteries in the toy and it stopped working a couple days later. I opened it up to find some batteries leaked also ruining the toy.Edit: Amazon has made since replaced the batteries for me."
I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.
It is the first time I purchased Amazon Basic AA Alkaline batteries and I am glad I did. It is a solid performer at reasonable price.. Will buy more in the future for sure!
"Sleek design. Comes with batteries needed. I've compared the number to another scale that same day hours later and it displayed the same number. I'd say it's very accurate. Clear display, thin black platform. Your typical scale. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion. I'd buy again and would recommend to a friend. Solid product."
Some batteries worked okay. I just had a problem where a new battery worked for a week and then there was no charge. Not worth the price.
"For the price and quantity I was sure this would be a great buy. Sadly, not all of the batteries worked. I first thought the camcorder we purchased was defective but when I swapped out the fresh, new batteries for a second round of fresh, new batteries from the same package the device magically came to life. Boo to you Amazon for selling batteries that don't actually work."
Exceptional batteries for the price. Just as good if not betterthan major brands. Sometimes you just pay extra for the brand. That is a waste of money.Quality can be found at a reasonable price like these batteries. Duracell and other brands are asking you topay for there brand name. Sometimes there is a difference. In this case I could not find any reason to pay a higher price.
These do not hold charge for long.
Works like a standard alkaline battery.
If you have kids you need these! We were pleased. These powered all the birthday gifts without a problem.
"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."
"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt."
Who doesn't need batteries
Worst batteries I've ever bought. Last about two weeks in a remote control.
These do not work good in cameras. I use a small point and shoot Cannon Camera for work. With these batteries I seem to be changing them almost every time I go out. Other name brand batteries seem to last 3-4 time longer.
"So far so good!, I put dates on these batteries to check the life line when installed into batteries power items. I'll have future updates on this items. Stand by!"
"Got enough now for any possible hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and other disasters that take out the electricity. YOU can never have too many batteries, just in case."
Stocked-up
Convenient and inexpensive. Comparable to Duracell and energizer. Can't tell the difference.
"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more."
"These work as well as the name brand batteries but are cheaper and better quality than even dollar store batteries. I use the subscribe and save service Amazon offers for batteries, wipes etc and save even more making them an even better value. At the rate my kids use AA batteries for their Xbox controllers, we need value!"
"Very nice packaging! Love the price and the nice convenient packaging makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!"
"These batteries are a really great buy, same quality as the name brand batteries at a much better price"
"My daughter has this terribly annoying doll that sings and dances. She has it playing 24/7, and these batteries are apparently going to last until the end of time. I almost want to drop my rating down because they work a little too well."
Just what I wanted. Last long enough to consider it as my preferred AAA batteries.
"lasted long, super reasonable price"
"We bought these batteries to use in a medical Holter Monitor. Typically we put batteries in for 24 or 48 hour monitors. After one use, we need to replace the batteries. These batteries did not even last the 24 hours. Patients wasted their time and the testing was wasted. It was embarrassing to make the patient reschedule their test due to our equipment failure. These cost our business money. Will never buy again."
I read somewhere that batteries were one of the more over-priced items we buy. Why get those expensive brand name batteries when generic batteries last just as long This is a super buy.
"Just as good as the name brands, maybe better. I use these in the Holiday decorations and still going strong!"
"So far these batteries have outlasted the Duracell batteries they replaced in my Xbox remote, at a fraction of the cost!"
They work great!
Works good and there are cheap. I will be buying more then I need them!
I will probably never buy batteries anywhere but here again. My husband is a gamer and typically blows through all kinds of batteries but these do the trick. I havent noticed them needing replacement any more frequent then other major brands like duracell or energizer
Most of these batteries either do not have any life left to them or they are die out after one use. terrible product.
Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.
"Can't believe Amazon's name is on these pieces of dung. Very short life. I've migrated to Eneloop rechargeables for AAA as well as AA now big savers, as I have a lot of doodads."
terrific
Trst
"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."
Thank You!
"I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected."
Great staple...
The appear to be as good as the rayovac's my kids blow through in the gaming controllers and at a slight savings. I think we'll keep using them!
"The batteries appear to be working great. I've been using two AA's in my Xbox One controller for over a month now. If you can get a sale on these like I did, buy, buy, buy!"
These batteries work just as well as name brand batteries while being substantially cheaper. These are also packaged well. The cardboard box is slim and holds its shape unlike a normal plastic battery box. The batteries are shrink-wrapped together so they stay nicely in place. I just take some from the end and leave the remaining batteries nicely in their package.
The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. We hve a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fans fly. A little disappointed.
"I use these for reading lights (the kind you clip on a book) which I use for coloring. The light gets dimmer after a few hours use the batteries I get from dollar tree last the same if not better. Duracell and energizer, however, last at least 20 hours before the light gets dim."
The batteries work fine. So far they seem to last quite a while. Haven't used them for very long to determine if they are any better than other batteries I have used/
The batteries work well.
love the easy to open packaging! these batteries long very long in my dslr camera!
"Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name."
"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again."
"These DO NOT WORK. I have tried them in 2-3 different clocks, and they are not working at all. When replaced with other batteries, the clocks started to work fine again.You get what you pay for..."
Powers what I want. The future is amazing!
The good quality I expect from Amazon.
The lights seem to work real well. I have not used them for long put they are plenty bright enough for the closet I'm using them in.
"The latest reviews of name brand batteries have gone downhill lately. It seems they leak, rust, don't last, etc.. Perhaps Amazon is licensing older battery technology, or their manufacturer is anyway. So what These work better than the name brands! These are the only batteries I will buy, except Lithium Smoke Detector batteries. Amazon Any plans for Lithium batteries"
The only batteries that I buy now! Price is great and they seem to hold up as good as their more expensive competition.
"Never knew that Amazon sold batteries until now. Stop buying those batteries at the grocery store and use these! I always run out of batteries in my wireless mouse and keyboard at the worst time because I ignore the low battery warnings. These batteries come in a small cardboard box about the size of 2 boxes of office pens. Inside, the batteries are wrapped in packs of 4 which keeps them neatly organized inside.Overall, these works extremely well and I will never buy batteries at the store again."
A++++ Seller. The Product was excellent and exactly what i needed.
Those of us in World War II can all appreciate what was happening in the South Pacific while we were elseware. I was in the North Pacific at a secret U.S.-Russian site where we were planning a joint attack of Japan. We hear nothing about what was happening farther South. The book ansered our questions.
"The package provided good quality batteries in a size I need most often, without including other sizes of less usefulness. I also appreciated the packaging, which is more accessible than the common drugstore packages (which can be a challenge to open)."
Appear to perform as well as top-brand batteries at a fraction of the price. The storage box they come in fits nicely in our utility drawer.
"They last as long as I need them to, there's a crap ton of them, I don't know what else to say."
These alkaline batteries appear to be of good quality and provide excellent power output to my devices. Only time will tell if they provide long life in storage without leaiagel
"These are a great price. I'm not sure they last as long as a name brand battery, but they get the job done."
"I bought these thinking, Great I can save some money!...... Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)...... Seriously, these batteries last me probably 2 hours when using them a lot...... Not kidding.....I will not repurchase these......."
These are AA batteries and they work. They do seem to die a bit faster in my Speedlight then duracells but maybe I just use it more since I have the 48 pack.
"Do not use these in any techy gadget, including remote controls, keyboards, and especially cameras!"
"Well, I usually write extensive reviews on products, but really there isn't much to say here. Lets cut to the chase. They are batteries. They are AAA size. And they work. No, they aren't the equivalent to lithiums and no they won't power your space shuttle to the moon, but what do you expect at this price I was going to test the actual mah of the battery, until I remembered how much I paid for them in comparison to the big brands I've purchased in the past at the drug store. Bottom line: A good mix of quality / quantity. They aren't your cheapest, junkiest battery but they also don't compare to the best AAA's, Energizer Lithiums. Mid-grade at a great price. Got lots of electronics needing AAA Get them. If you're needing to use them in place of rocket propellent, look elsewhere."
"These are fantastic alkaline batteries that work just as well as some of the name brands. They are long lasting in my controllers, remotes, clocks, devices, and more. I highly recommend them. Great price too. Compare and save."
"These are fine, for the price but not as Duracell"
"These are great batteries for around the house and I don't notice any runtime difference between them and the other major brands. The price is awesome, and they work as expected. Nothing else to say about AA's really :)"
"These are great batteries without paying the premium for name brands. Our kids go through batteries like their potato chips, so its nice to get a good product at a reasonable price."
"These are great batteries, at a great deal. They last a long time and we are very happy with the purchase. We did however have some that are DOA, I called Amazon and they took care of us, AWESOME customer service, as always."
"The basic AA batteries that can only do its job well. I haven't tested it about it's life span yet, but seems not bad, as you can have a great number of them to use for a long time!they are excellent kind batteries for the price, though it is not better than some other it is as good quality of most brands. because you just have pay extra money for the brand which is a waste of money.I don't have any reason to pay a higher price product."
These are great batteries. They compare with national brands.
"These are great for the price! They do tend to die slightly faster than other batteries, but overall they are great for what you pay. I would recommend these to anyone looking for basic batteries. The come in a plastic wrap which is easy to open. The same can't be said about some battery brands."
These are great quality at an even better price. I am always rummaging through the junk drawer in desperation when the remote dies mid Netflix binge. Now I can binge on for all eternity!
"These are my new go to for batteries. Last holiday season I used these batteries in half of our window candles and Duracell it the other half. Basically no difference in battery life and the price can't be beat. If anything, the candles with these batteries lasted longer."
"This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference."
These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.
"Arrived on time, battery doesn't last very long though even when fully charged, so that's my only concern."
These are really good batteries. We have gotten these a few times now and haven't had any issues with them at all. They work well in everything we have tried them in. They seem to hold up just as long as other brands of batteries do. These are a good buy. would definitely recommend these batteries to other people.
So far I love it very good price and all the batteries are fully charged :) (I checked!) I also love the package that it was in. I'm using it as storage for these batteries right now very useful. I guess all I'm saying everything that comes with this are useful :)
"These batteries are awesome, i will be ordering these again! we have a rc car and had in brand new brand name batteries and the rc car was slower than when we put in the amazon batteries!! you could tell the difference. They don't get hot easily. They also last awhile."
Crazy good deal. These batteries are easily every bit as good as top brand name batteries. My kids now prefer amazon batteries to any other in their console controllers... which I think says a lot. Great job Amazon!!
These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.
"I keep a good stock of batteries in my house. We have lots of flashlights and toys that require them. These are nicely affordable and I compare them to Energizer batteries, easily. (Don't look at 2nd pic if you're OCD )"
These batteries are great and last very long I would definitely recommend them to a friend or family over the Duracell brand better pricing
"These batteries are great, I used Duracell before for my remotes etc, but i am impressed with these, I am getting much longer life from them. I am updating this review, this will be the only battery I use, they last a long time, and are a good price!"
These batteries are great. They last forever and are much cheaper than the name brands. Will continue to buy.
"These batteries do what batteries need to do. I'm writing a review b/c this was an Alexa deal, which she told me was 5, and was charged 8."
"These batteries don't work well! My bluetooth mouse wouldn't stay on any more, even when I put fresh Amazon batteries in them. So I bought a new mouse and it wouldn't work with the new batteries. Then I used Duracell and the mouse was fine!Same thing happened with my Roku remote."
"Have I sold you yet If not, just imagine sitting on your couch, remote in hand, and all of the sudden you can't change the channel anymore. You can't turn the volume up when your girlfriend is asking you to do stuff. You can't turn the volume up when she does that stupid, annoying, thing when she eats. YOU CAN'T TURN IT UP WHEN SHE'S TALKING TO HER MOM! Before these batteries my relationships did not last long, as girlfriends love asking you to do stuff, eating, talking to their mom. Since my purchase of these batteries, and my ability to turn the volume up to earbleeding levels whenever my girlfriend opens her mouth, I have been much, much happier.Buy these batteries.They probably also work in other things like digital thermostats (to make your house unbearably hot for her menopausal mother), flashlights, and clocks."
These batteries have been performing wonderfully in my clocks and other small appliances. The price is right with Subscribe and Save and I can't beat the quality or price elsewhere. They come nicely packed and shrink wrapped in four packs making them easy to carry. I will definitely continue to purchase.
"Great price, and shipped safely and Amazon was efficient with the packaging. I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for AA batteries, but these happen to work quite well."
"These batteries seem to work great and last plenty long enough for my use cases (remotes, computer mouse, flashlights, etc.)."
"these batteries work extremely well, and i have proved this by field testing them in my girlfriends torpedo big john toys. Last a long time. have not experienced any moisture induced corrosion YTD."
"These batteries work just fine. I don't see a need for writing some big long review about batteries. All we care about is do they work, are they strong Absolutely and I will buy them again"
I used to by the cheap chinese batteries from HF. Now that I've discovered AmazonBasics I'm now converted. These last much longer and are the best bang for your buck. I will certainly buy more when these run out!
These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries.
These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..
These seem to be normal AAA batteries. can't comment yet on life expectancy but for the price they could stand to be near the bottom performance and still be an okay value.
These seem to work just as good as any other AA battery but for SO MUCH CHEAPER. Seems like every battery operated device in our house takes AAs. I buy these as well as the Amazon rechargeable ones and they all work great. No regrets with this purchase.
These seem to work just as well as the expensive name brands. I will only buy these from now on.
These seem to work well in my household items. I have used them mostly in my remotes. I have no complaints!
"For the many devices that use batteries in our house, these were great, low-priced option. Will incrementally switch high-use devices to rechargeables for even greater savings."
"These were so cheap, but they work just as well as name brand batteries. Come in a cardboard box which is so much easier for storage than those cardboard and plastic things"
Great battery life! Will definitely buy again whenever this giant box of batteries runs out. expiration date several years out.
why on earth would yo pay for Duracell or Energizer These work great and last a long time !
These batteries are exactly what you would expect. I have not had any issues with them not lasting long. I would recommend these to anyone looking to purchase batteries.
"These work very well in everything I've put them in. I've used them in battery operated clocks, led flashlights, calculators, AV remotes, computer mice, etc. You might buy something cheaper, but these perform very well and seem to last longer than most I have tried."
"I buy all my batteries from Amazon now, they are a great price for the amount of batteries you get and I don't notice a difference between them and Duracell"
Halloween is coming so time to stock up on batteries. I think Amazon batteries are just as good as any other and the price is right.
They are batteries
"For the first time, a product that had packaging that was designed for the product and the product made it to me in one piece. as for the batteries, well, they are batteries and power my items just fine."
they are batteries and they make my battery powered stuff work so im not sure how this could get a low rating. for the price well worth it. that said they don't seem to last quite as long as other name brands.
"They are batteries, and low cost. Don't know how long they will last yet. Tell you more on that, when the time comes."
"You get what you pay for, AAA batteries at a budget cost. Not sure what else to say here..."
"They are batteries. So far, decent power life."
"They are batteries. They are cheap. They work. That is all, goodnight."
"They are batteries. They have charge. They are well-priced. 5-stars, touchee amazon."
Ours did not last nearly as long as energizer or Duracell in our sons toys. No real data to prove this other than we went through batteries like they were candy until I restocked with energizer.
they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long.
switched to amazon brand batteries.. they are great
They make things go! There are many of them! They are not dead on arrival like some competitors.
"Yup, batteries cheap. They are packaged like a PITA though and you ahve to rip these outa shrink wrap. Good for commercial resale in a store, since they are then packaged into smaller units for resale, for home use when you what to just dump them into a box and be done for the kids to grab like Halloween candy for all their gear - not easy to do that with. But to of batteries its still a good deal.. just expect some work opening them all up to dump them out."
"Great for the price, the have lasted as long as name brands. I will purchase more in the future."
"They arrived on time, as described, and have been powering the PIR lights I ordered for a few weeks now with out needing to be changed. I have no reason to complain."
"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing."
"The batteries seem to do just as well as any other batteries I might get from the store. I appreciate the effiency of just being able to order them from Amazon, and I like that I can get such a large quantity at a good price."
I'm always satisfied with these batteries
"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months."
Very little capacity. They last only about 25 as long when compared with other main stream batteries
"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well"
They dooooo the job at amore reasonable price.
These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.
"Bought these for a couple of baby toys, and so far, they have worked great. They are much cheaper compared to other popular brands!"
I bought these last year and they're still working!
I am all about Amazon Basics but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order. Would love to go for a great generic brand but this just isn't it. I've been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the ProCells.
They last a very short time once in use. Put fresh ones in a soap dispenser and they lasted 8 days. Other brand lasted 2 months
What a great deal! They last as long as any other 'name brand' batteries!
I only use Amazon basics batteries now. They last as long as name brands at a much better price.
Good batteries...
"bought these for remote control vehicle, they lasted pretty long, several hours , so they did the job"
They do what I need batteries to do.
"They are batteries. They make my possessions which require batteries to do their thing. I have not noticed a difference in the time between battery changes because I have more important things to do, but with this price, I'm ok if it isn't the longest lasting in the world. Side note, the packaging on these is quite wonderful. No more taking my life into my hands trying to get at a couple of batteries."
They seem to not last as long as other brands. Great Price though
So far so good.
"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning."
Burnt up a copper string light I have been using for a years. Short life on other electronics compared to Duracell. Left in a wii controller for 2 months and leaked all over.
Solid batteries. Never been disappointed by amazon batteries before
These batteries seem to work just as good as other leading brands and at a cheaper price point! I haven't had any leaks in anything I have used them in so far.
They are pretty much your typical AAs for a very cheap price.
They look.like batteries work like batteries but does anyone ever measure how long they work Seem good to me like.most Amazon products
They work but dont last as long as better quality batteries
They work.
"bought these for wireless keyboards and mice, they work and seem to have a pretty long life."
No more going to the store for batteries for me. So far they have been working fine.
"I was intending to buy rechargeables, but bought these by mistake. They work fine though."
"I dont know what I could possibly say that over 6,000 other reviewers have not already said.. so I won't even go into details. I needed more AAA batteries, and I am a amazon-junkie so I ordered their batteries. Popped three into a flashlight that needed batteries.. and I had light! They work.. Now how they will hold up over time, I do not know yet.. but they work for now and worked in my flashlight so I am happy with them!"
They work good!
AmazonBasics AAA rock
"So far, they work great and have lasted a few days in my trail cameras, and I like the price."
"For price, convenience, and power... these batteries deliver just what you need. If you're here trying to find decent priced batteries in bulk, just hit Buy Now, I've not been sorry. From powering kid's toys, mama's toys, and daddy's toys... they work great."
"Nothing wrong with these batteries. They seem to work just as good as the named brand ones I buy at the store and they defiantly work better than the cheap-o ones. I am currently using some in a battery operated lanterns, a flash light, and one of my youngest daughters toy. I have not experienced any problems with these.I really like that I can order good quality batteries at a good price and have them delivered to my door. Honestly we could always use more batteries at our house."
They work great.and the price is really great!
They work great. Best value on batteries.
"These work GREAT and are much more affordable! This pack will last about 2 months but that's because nobody else buys batteries in my house. They all take mine which had become too expensive of a habit for me. They work just as well (if not better!) than the brand I used to buy. I'll be buying other sizes of these to have on hand, especially since they don't break my (limited) wallet!"
"They work not bad , but these batteries does not work in some devices, I do not know why This is why I dropped one star off."
"They work we... Maybe don't last as long as the high dollar batteries, but the price makes up for that."
They work well enough. Probably don't have the longevity of a Duracell but for the price you're coming out on top.
"I don't know much about batteries, but these work....so I love them!"
"They work, and they cost less than in the stores."
They're batteries and they work.
"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
Works like a charm.
they're batteries
They're batteries.
"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know."
These are AAA batteries and Amazon didn't mess it up. Woo-hoo!
Amazon's in house brand of batteries are not bad at all.
"As with my review of the other batteries I reviewed, they're batteries. They all work and provide approximately 1.5vdc as supposed to."
They're good quality batteries for a really good price! You'd be stupid to pass this deal up!
"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but..."
They don't seem to last long
"Theyre batteries they either work or they don't, how long do they last I don't know I just got them at Christmas !!"
"This are so good I keep coming back for more. I've used other brands and the so called good fall behind in performance. The top of the line, are really good, but they put a dent in my pocket. I use this all around the house along with the AAA ones. To all give it a try before you judge them, maybe you end up with a smile and extra cash from the saving."
This does not last for more than two months on my LG Magic remote.A basic remote truck lasts only for four days.
I wish I knew Amazon sold batteries sooner. We live in an isolated community and batteries cost an arm and a leg here. So far they seem to be equivalent to the other name brands. I haven't been using them long enough to tell if they last shorter or longer than other battery brands. This is a great bargain nonetheless. I will probably continue to buy my batteries here from now on.
This is my 2nd time purchasing these batteries. They last as long as any other brand. I will continue to buy these. I have also started my office buying these.
This is the standard Cut/Past Note for a product that for no other reason works and does a job but the Amazon folk wont let you get away without saying something.
"Batteries at this price, you can't go wrong!"
This was a really good buy. I needed for a work function and it was exactly what we were looking for
A lot of batteries for the good price. But they don't last too long.
as expected.
Batteries Didn't Last Long
Batteries seem to die quickly.
"battery drains out fast, unlike duracell"
Battery's charge ran out very quickly.
Bought as a gift to go with the vibrator.
Brought wrong size for the walkie talkies i purchased..but can find use for them
Cheap and convenient.
"Definitely are inexpensive, but we seem to go through them very, very fast. So... not sure."
Does not have same charge as top brands. Caveat emptor.
Does not last long
"Doesn't hold the strength of Duracell, etc."
Doesn't last long at all
doesn't last very long
Don't last as long as Duracells.
Excellent price but DEFINITELY didn't last as long as popular/known brands.
fine
Good deal for outdoor solar lights.
Good: but don't seem to last as long as major brands
Great price for the quantity but it seems they don't last as long as the major brands.
Have not had the opportunity ti critique
I have not fully tested these AA batteries so I don't have them evaluated.
I like how i got so many itd months later and i still got a pack left!!
i meant to order AA and not AAA.I shall reorder
I think it was recargable
I wouldnt say they are worse or better then name brand batteries. about the same
I'll be paying extra for energizers they last longer.
I'm super charged over the price of these batteries!!!!
Inexpensive! But they die quickly.
It's a battery...
Lasted half the time as duracell in the same product
love it
lower value as they last about one hour but good for a flash light
Made in the USA would make this a 5 star
maybe it's just me... but they don't seem to last very long
Needed them in a hurry - don't last that long.
"Nice value, average life."
Not all that long life.
not as good as the higher quality batteries would not buy again
not much better than the dollar store brand
nothing bad to say but I can get others for cheaper price.
ok
ok
ok
OK for AAA needs
Ok. Worth the price paid.
Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :(
Put in my mouse for just 3 days. Power is off again.
Seem to discharge quickly
So far they have worked well. I do not know how to compare them on quality yet.
sticking to longer life energizers
The battery life was not as long as Duracell and energizer.
"these are not comparable to Duracell, but it's cheap"
These batteries are reasonably priced but I found they do not last as long as other batteries
These batteries just don't seem to last as long as Everready batteries.
These didn't last very long.
These don't seem to hold a charge as well as the major brands.
They didnt last as long as duracells
They do not last long.
They don't charge after 3 or 4 uses.
They hold there charge!
They ran out of energy very quick but it's a deal
they seem to have a very short life span. do not think i would buy again.
they work but I wish they were USA made
They're batteries.
TV Clicker about 2 months
we'll see how they hold up
Weird but some didn't last long as they should
Worked great.
Works
works like any another.
Worth the price
you get what you pay for... they are not great
"Hard to beat that price, they're Alkaline...."
"Great price for all these batteries. No complaints on the performance, but I've only used them in remote controls"
"Love these batteries, i never like to run out of batteries, all sizes i hoard. Great quality, and they come in convienent storage boxes."
Seem to be just as good as every other name brand battery.
Very good so far
Great bang for the buck.
Seemingly sufficient at a good price!
Works as expected. Time will tell if AAA from amazon are a better value.
Top quality batteries. I've bought them many times.
Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money.
"Tremendous Value! My kids go thru AA batteries at a ferocious pace. Doesn't matter the brand, they burn through them. These last as long as what we'd previously buy at the store, but at a fraction of the price!!!!"
"Tried them in my amazon firestick remote and they failed to make the remote work. However, no batteries have made it work. Seems the Amazon firestick remote is the problem. In any event I am stuck with 8 batteries that I do not need."
"These batteries are great. To have so many in a small package, is very convenient. They came on time and were well packaged.I would recommend this seller."
"I was skeptical before trying these AmazonBasics AA batteries. I didn't think they could possibly compare to the Duracell batteries I've used for as long as I can remember. But I was wrong. These batteries last just as long, and the price is so much more reasonable! Kudos to Amazon for offering their AmazonBasics products. Stop wasting money needlessly and try these AA batteries. You'll be glad you did!"
works as you would think..grat price
"Great price for these batteries. We are now buying all of our batteries on Amazon. At this price, batteries are roughly .25/each. Can't even get close to that price at any other store. I am not able to give you any data on whether they last longer or shorter than Everready or other commercial brands."
2 of my candles stop working after 2 weeks!!
"About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away"
Adequate
Affordable
Bad shelf life. No where near Duracell. For very light duty only.
Batteries did not last very long!
Batteries do not last used all 48 after thanksgiving ned replacing to replace.
Battiers dont last very long
Buy for TV remotes. Stick with Duracell for anything else
Charge doesnt last
Do not last long.
Doesn't last long.
Don't last nearly as long as major brands.
Drain quick
Drains out quickly like cheap dollar tree stuff
Go with a brand name.
I'm feeling like these are running out of performance faster than other batteries I've purchased.
More then half don't work
"not a fan, seem to run out quick"
Not great for remote control car.
Not great for use in video game controllers. They drain really fast.
One in every three of these has leaked battery acid in a matter of days l.
Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase.......
Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity.
The batteries go dead very quickly
These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries
These die really quick.
They didn't last as long as say Duracell..in my opinion.
They dont really last long
they need to be change to offen
they seem to wear out really fast
"They were cheap yes, and it shows. They don't last long at all. You get what you pay for..."
Wore out quickly
My Son Goes Through Double A Batterie and WHEN I Seen This Good Deal i Jumped ON it Theses ARE Great Batteries and WELL Worth it
Two thumbs up
"I was a bit hesitant to order these because, you know, low priced batteries. But guess what Good quality batteries at a low price. What more could you ask These are as good or better than Duracell for less money.Well, go ahead and get them! You KNOW you'll need them.Go ahead."
"And I could have bought Energizer batteries. These are OK, but not a US company. Who knows what damage their manufacture is doing to the planet."
"Upon counting, visually inspecting, sampling, and weighed each one, results indicated consistent specs and quality as the ad listing had implied."
used Alexa to order was not just telling her to order and not having to go and look this up
"These batteries seemed to die very quickly. We used them for xbox one and wii controllers and while I wasn't the only person to use them, nor was I always around when they were being used to gauge the amount of their use, I seemed to have to replace batteries weekly."
Great. Works like any other battery.
DO not buy this product I've received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. As soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Tried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn't so apparently I'm just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!!
"I use these in a three battery work light and probably 2-3 times per 48 one dies much more quickly than the others. I put them on a meter and 2 have 1.25v left but the third has around .75v. Frustrating, but I think they're still a good value"
Great value for the money
Value
What a great value .
Value for money
Good value.
Great value and fast shipping. Seem to last as long as other brands
"they work!they look pretty!they are cheap!they come fast!recommended!8 more words are needed, so - if you need batteries, buy these!"
Tremendous. These work great and at a great price
"Very competitive product at good price. I originally rated this le, but learned I had. made a mistake in my install."
Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.
"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better."
"When I opened the package there were only 17 batteries, not the 20 that I ordered and paid dor."
"Amazon batteries are ok, they do not last as Duracell and i wish the have rechargeable ones , very disappointed!!"
very efficient -handy when needed!
"I often buy Amazon Basic products, and until I tried their batteries I've never had a complaint. But these batteries drain faster than any but the absolute cheapest I've ever used. So no bargain there. You get what you pay for with this, unlike most other Amazon branded items."
At first I was a little skeptical about getting these batteries but after reading some of the reviews I decided to take a chance and try them for myself. The results....These batteries are on the money!! I would definitely recommend them to family and friends.
These are great batteries. Last as long as any other quality alkalines. Love'm and this is my 3rd purchase.
"Very good batteries at a good price, as good as coppertop, are any others."
Very good batteries. Much cheaper than the others.
Really good working.
All are working as they should. Very good purchase.
Good quality batteries at a reasonable price.
"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
Great batteries. Amazon brand is excellent.
"I just received these and immediately tested all 24 with my trusty digital multi-meter....22 tested excellent to better than normal, and two tested right in the normal to little less than normalto what any commercial brand battery tests...therefore, I'm very happy with this shipment, but I'll review the life-span in the field with daily use in our irrigation drip system-timers and post that when I have results. thanks Amazon!...I will buy these again!"
I'm only going to give it 4 stars since I have not had on go bad yet so I can't say how much longer the name brand batteries will lat until one remote control that I put one off each in it so I'll see what lasted the longest and probley replace this battery and see how much longer the name brand lasts any way the money you save I can afford for them not to last quite as long
Very happy with these batteries. I have changed from other brands to solely the Amazon batteries.
Great deal and they work fine! Very pleased with these. Comparable to major brands.
"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!"
These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries.
They were very good
As good as any other brands like rayovac or that other one I cant think of .
Very nice product and I'm very happy with it. My experience with this seller was excellent. I would not hesitate to deal with them again.
Been using these batteries for almost a year. Very pleased with them
"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it."
Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.
"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these."
"Good price, good product"
Great deal. Very satisfied with value and performance. Seem to last as long as anything else.
As advertised! Great price!
We couldn't be happier. Very light and easy to use. Price is unbelievable.
I used the batteries in my flameless candles 3x for about8 hours. Total bummer! They all died. Won't purchase again!Amazon should reconsider selling these turkeys Wow. Was IDisappointed. How about a replacement for these fake batterieswith real ones!
Awful. Have almost gone through a whole box to find a battery or two that actually work.
I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work.
I have no issue with the actual batteries. They work fine. My problem is with the extremely wasteful packaging. The 20-pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two slots for 10 batteries each. They could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box.
"Good price for batteries. Have only used a few of them thus far, but they work."
Way better price than name brand like engergizer. I have a little boy who needs batteries for everything. This way he don't break the bank.
We always need this size battery and when the family comes to visit they snag for their electronics too. Thanks so much
We aren't running out of batteries now for game controllers. They seem to work just as well as any name brand.
We have been using Amazon batteries for a while now and they seem to last as long as any we have used and the price is better
We ordered these batteries all the time! The price is so much more reasonable than name brand batteries and they work just as well. We have a toddler running around our house so as you can imagine ever single toy we own needs batteries.Totally satisfied with our purchase every time!
We've bought these a few times. We run through batteries like crazy...and these are the very best for the very least. Highly recommend!!
"Price and reviews were pretty good, only time will tell..."
We've ordered these batteries twice now and they're great. They really last in my kids toys and for the price you can't beat it. They last in a furby that's played with just about 14 hours out of the day for over a week (which is awesome!)
"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
"For the price,they are well worth it."
Well i am a fan of the Amazon Basic items. They are life saver for me.I don't have much to say as Amazon basic quality and economy prices are well know to everyone.Thank you Amazon for the Amazon Basic items.
Well I just received my second order of these batteries and of course they will come in handy with the holidays here. I have several of those artificial candles on my mantelpiece and they go through batteries like they are free. So now I am sure I have enough to get through the next several weeks!
"Shipped lightning fast! I will never buy another big brand battery - especially for bulk use. Gone through the pack, plenty of juice and long lasting."
It's been quite a while since I've needed batteries and I didn't want to pay the brick-and-mortar prices. They came well-packaged and according to Amazon they keep well. I haven't needed to use more than 2 but I can say that it came fully powered and I hope they keep as well as advertised!
decent quality
"I love these batteries. First they are priced cheaper than the name brands but offer the same performance. They come in no frustration packaging instead of the terrible clamshells that most batteries from the store do. The cardboard box offers a handy place to store them in without being cut by the plastic or having them fall out of the pack. Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be powering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision anytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback."
What a great price. Love having extra batteries around the house at Christmas time.
They are batteries and work just like batteries should. No complaints here.
What can I say. They're AA Alkaline Batteries and they're affordable.-1 Star because the packaging was GIGANTIC compared to the size of the actual batteries.
Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.
You can buy these at a good price and they seem to last as well as any of the big brands. So I will continue to buy these batteries.
It's inexpensive AAA batteries delivered to your door. I mean... whats not awesome about that
"10 year shelf life check.Reliable manufacturer check.Great price check.Great packaging. check...my 20-pak came as to separate 10-paks.Great performance I don't know yet, but WhyWouldAmazonBother with less than best in class commodity product branding Benefit of the doubt goes to Amazon for now. check."
"So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again."
did order or get
Works just as well as name brand batteries but for a fraction of the price!!!
Great batteries seem just as good as expensive ones
Great price! Long lasting!
"Yes, they're AAA batteries, and they work as advertised... batteries come in a perfectly sized compact box, which can also be kept for storage purposes. Great shelve life too!!"
So far these batteries are performing well and the price was unbeatable too.
"Amazon batteries work just as well as other brands, why waste your money!"
Very happy with my purchase of these. We fly thru batteries at my house so this was a good investment. The ones I've used so far seem to be working great and haven't died yet.This would be great for Christmas time toys!
Great product
Will buy again. I used to buy the coppertop
Work fine Good price.
Always happy with my Amazon Basics purchases!
Very happy with them. Work as well as name brand ones that are twice the price.
Best batteries that I have purchased.
Good batteries. Great price!
Love buying batteries from Amazon. For this many it is a great price and you don't have to carry them home from the store.
Have used about half of these now with no issues. They seem to last as long as the name brands and in this house double AA are always needed.
BATTERIES have a very SHORT LIFE... WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN..
"Not a high performance battery, it's good for timer lights but not for regular usage, will not order these again..."
do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries
They don't seem to be working very well - - last a day or so in the remote
I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.
"Fast shipping, will buy again and again"
Wonderful deal. Great product.
These batteries are awesome! Just as good as the name brand for a fraction of the price! Great job Amazon!
So far I can't tell the difference from other name brand batteries. Wonderful to be able to purchase batteries at this price and be delivered free by being a Prime Member.
Over half were dead or real close to.dead and ones that did work lose power really fast. Very disappointed in Amazon on these and their aaa.
I tried recharging them right out of the box and it says they are bad! I'll by my rechargeables elsewhere
Work at expected
"These batteries work great. 100 satisfied. I haven't timed them to compare them to others, but they seem to last a long time."
"I needed some and the price is good! Liked the packaging...they don't all roll out when opened at one end (no so with some of the normal name brands)! Seem to be lasting as long as the other brands (but I will let you know if that statement changes).Amazon is a good brand. I'll reorder when I need more!Yep, I recommend this product"
Work as well as the name brands and alot in price.
Work fine
Work fine. These are really nice and they are cheap.
"Work Great, Great Value"
They work as expected and so far are lasting in the devices!
"Definitely Batteries, Definitely AAA! Work great! Great Price!"
Work as well as any other batteries.
"I'm really happy with these, they really surprised me. They're head to head with top brands eg. Energizer, Duralast, Raovac. I'm definitely going to buy my batteries from here now, they're such a good deal for such great performing batteries :)"
"These batteries are an awesome price, and they work just the same as purchasing Energizer or Duracell. I see no reason to ever purchase those expensive brands again. I order the bulk sizes from Amazon and they keep me stocked up for quite a long time!"
"Cant see any difference from the more expensive Duracell batteries. Great price. Use them for flashlights clocks, and remote controls."
Work just fine
Wonderful batteries that seem to be well-worth the price we paid!
"Work just like any other high end batteries I have purchased in the past but at a great price. Will buy more of these in the future, for sure!"
"Work just as well as the name brand ones with the much higher price! Very pleased with these batteries and will buy the Amazon brand, again!"
They last as long as the name brand and save some bucks too !!
No problems so far. Seem to last a long time. Very happy. Great deal.
work perfectly! great value! very happy!
"Seem to work ok, but less than Energizer in my camera. Otherwise they are a great item with a great price."
"These work well in heavy duty use, I use them for my bicycle lights"
"Work like batteries should, got a bunch cheap"
"I used to buy bulk energizer batteries at the club stores but these are cheaper, delivered to my home, and work just as well. Will definitely continue to purchase."
They work!
"I like most AmazonBasics products I've tried. They are generally good at performing their intended functions without frills: Basic!These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are less than brand name batteries at my local big-box store and appear to work just as well for me. My use in in a keyboard, several remote controls (including Fire TV and Echo remotes), and some radio linked thermometers I bought last century but still work great. I'm sure I use them other places I've forgotten.Do they last as long as Duracell Ultra or whatever super-duper alkaline I might have gotten in the past If they don't, it's not such that I've noticed and that's good enough for me. I'm not into battery performance enough to run tests keep records! If you are, spend more money on famous brand name batteries!What I got was a simple cardboard box with 36 cells group in fours with plastic around each four. A lot like other batteries I've purchased in the last couple of years. No packaging drama and that's nice.The AmazonBasicis AAA batteries perform well enough to satisfy me, are inexpensive, and just fit and work wherever I need AAA cells. Just the basics and that's just what I want. When I get what I want I give 5 stars.Hope this helps someone."
"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."
Worked as advertised!
Seemed to work just like any other batteries. My boys have had them running in their remote control cars for hours.
Working fine and I really like the way they are packaged. They are grouped into packages of 5 batteries and plastic wrapped so you can keep them separated and also carry conveniently without worrying about them getting lost on an individual bases or possibly coming into contact with something that my cause a short or problem of some kind.
A ton of batteries for cheap. They are working great so far in my wireless Xbox controller that I use for my PC.
Cheap Quality Batteries
does what its suppose to do but doesn't really seem to have a lot of juice in them
There batteries... They work.
works a lot better than the ones I buy at the dollar store with much 'energy' and price is affordable as well.
Works as advertised.
I decided to give these a try because with s 3 year old and 6.5 month old we go through so many batteries. These are working great and were cheaper than the ones we had been buying in a store. I have not noticed having to change batteries quicker than with other batteries in any of my boys' toys.
They hold up for a decent amount of time (seems close to the same amount of time as other discount batteries) but you can't beat the price.
Great value and works just like any other battery. Very economical and good deal.
Works as expected!
Keeps the remote for the TV working so my lazy butt does not have to get up and manually change channels!
Work as good as the national brand
Works.
"Just when you're cursing at the Xbox Gods for forsaking you and their non-rechargeable controllers - in comes Amazon's AA batteries. They're great, they last a while, and you get a crap load! Especially useful when you don't want to spend that 25 for a rechargeable battery pack that may fail in a couple months of you throwing your controller down in a rage quit."
Works as well as name brand batteries
Lasts as long as the name brands for a fraction of the cost. I also like the minimal packaging that is also easy to open.
works fine.
I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.
"works fine. don't know if they are better than name brands, but they do job for me."
Works good love the packaging and for a good price
Cheaper than other brands but work just as well. Will buy again!
work great thank you
WORKS GREAT
works great
"Works great so far, only small gripe is they stink (like paint thinner). Weird yes I know, but nonetheless they work and that's all that counts!"
Works great what more can I say. Several months in the mouse so far
Batteries! Yeah!
Great batteries and will purchase more!
Works Great!
Works great! Prepare to be grossed out by what's hiding in there...
Works just as good as other name brand batteries. I can't speak for longevity as these are used in devices that either gets used a lot or sometimes not for a week at a time. So far I would buy again.
Seem to be long-lasting. Works just great.
Works just like the more expensive Duracell or enigizeer batteries for a fraction of the cost. The last just as long too.
Works well for the price point and is completely comparable to name brand batteries. I will be purchasing all of my future battery needs from amazon basics.
"I have not seen that these AmazonBasics batteries lose their charge any quicker than the name brands, like other off brands are wont to do. For the price, these are a better value than other multi-packs I have seen. I will definitely keep buying these as long as they are available at these prices."
"Works perfectly, I'm interested to see how they hold up over time."
Love these batteries! Wonderful price and a great product!
WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline
Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.
Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy
"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME."
"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !"
These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.
Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.
die hard Ray O Vac user but due to price I am trying these based on reviews.
Finally I have enough batteries! A nice supply of batteries that seem to last as good as any and better than many. They came in a package that was good for storing them. A very useful battery as many products use them today.
Bargain
"Good bargain, great price and last as long as brand name batteries."
So far so good
"Great deal, no problems, with the purchase."
"These are a great value and seem to last almost as long as Duracells. I would recommend them. I've had a pair in a remote for almost a year now, still going strong."
Good deal.
So far these batteries have worked out just as good as the name brand.
"Cheaper than others but work just as good, if not better."
horrible --- they barely last a week in my tv remote control
GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE
I like these batteries. I go through AA batteries a lot with my children's toys..
48 batterys for only 15 Very good deal!!! Nice batterys also work perfectly.
wow what value i just found my new brand of batteries last just as long as the duresall and eneagiser
"Dude. These lights are so amazing! They are the perfect addition underneath our kitchen cabinets. I really love the remote, which allows you to not only dim the lights, but it also has a timer! The individual lights came with two small screws to install, as well as 3M tape. We used the screws for a more durable effect. The lights also came with brand new batteries in them to get you started! As an interior decorator and stager, I'll tell my clients about these. Great product!"
"Best bang for buck on batteries, and always good to have a small stock of them on hand for whatever you might need.split this with my roommate, and so we now each have some AAA and we also split a pack of AA, great for the controllers that dont get used regularly, toys, remotes, whatever, if you plan ahead, it is worth it."
Great deal! Last just as long as my other batteries!
Seem to lady just as long as the name brand. Worth a go for flash photographers
You can never have enough good batteries on hand !
I have so many devices that require AA batteries. This was a great deal. These batteries last nearly as well as any I've ever used.
You can't beat these batteries when it comes to price. My son has seemingly a million toys that require batteries and it's always handy to have some around when he leaves them on (thomas the train motorized engines). Buying these from Amazon saves me a lot of money vice buying them from a major retailer. Thanks Amazon!Pro: cheap and reliable
Great cheap batteries for around the house. They dont last forever but they are great for remotes and computer mouses and such. and you cant beat the price!
You get a lot for a great price! I mainly just use them for my xbox one controller and they last for quite a long time!
Great batteries for an excellent price! Why pay more Free shipping with Prime. It doesn't get any better.
Some of the batteries did not work well.
You just can't beat the price of these and they last almost as long as much more expensive brands.
"The price and packaging on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something."
Great value and great product
Very happy with these!!
Save yourself a lot of frustration when you need new batteries by purchasing this package of AAs and having them on hand. They are long lasting and so nice to be available for those must-have times.
"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment."
They are batteries and as such work just as expected.
Yup!
Yup. Batteries.
Yup. Batteries. They work.
"I ordered this car for my son not really knowing what to expect, and have not been dosappointed. It is the smoothest remote control we have ever ownded and it can go over 50 yards before losing signal. It is a beautiful car!"
"With an Income Tax Preparation practice I'm on my laptop 10 hours a day entering data. Using the laptop keyboard and mouse pad on the flat and level angle that laptops offer is stressful. An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. This AmazonBasic Ventilated and Adjustable laptop stand is perfect and produces the effect of a typewriter slant for those who grew up on IBM Selectrics or Royals. Fully adjustable for just about any angle you are comfortable with. Well made, light weight and it looks as a 'piece of the laptop' in sight. One small warning: the tabs on the front end that keep your laptop from sliding off may be a bit short for some laptops. The tabs rise only .75 of an inch (3/4). My current, and several past laptops, the front sits 1.0 inches (1) at top front but slanting down at .75 of an inch (3/4) inward. The slant keeps the tabs on the stand from holding the laptop in place - causing the laptop to slip down and off. Simple solution to this: Binder Clips. Use the medium size binder clip, one on each of the stand tabs. You can find 'binder clips' on the Amazon web site. A box is under 4 but you only need 2 medium binder clips so . . . check with a school teacher or office worker and get two for free. Other than that, the right tool at the right price. Buy one and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did."
"Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba seems to occasionally do. So that is my only con for this item. I would still suggest buying it."
"Can't seem to say enough about this awesome stand. This allows me to utilize my laptop monitor and a second flawlessly. The cord keep on the back is great as well. I am about to purchase another monitor and with the choices of adjustment angle, this stand should place the two screens side by side perfectly for that one as well.There is no vibration through the metal as the contacts on the bottom are padded. The fan on my laptop almost never comes on even during day long uploads to the cloud due to this stand having it suspended in air on mesh.Very, very glad I made this purchase. Easily worth much more than I paid, the options for adjustment angles are ample, and lets my expensive baby run cool. Buy with confidence!"

The two guard stops at the bottom are WAY TOO HIGH. They dig into my wrists are are painful after only 5 minutes.Everything else about the stand is excellent for a 13 laptop. It'll only work if you use an extended keyboard.Impossible to type directly on the laptop b/c of poor design. The guards just need to be brought down and 1/2 their size and this would be perfect.
"I mostly use my laptop on my lap. Go figure. I have a 17 inch laptop and have tired a few other portable laptop holders, all plastic, and they have all broken with in a couple of months. This one is metal but still lightweight. It also has the added value of having a flat, perforated base which makes it more comfortable in my lap and it gives me a place to place peripherals such as external hard drives. I am very happy with this product and recommend it."
"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos."

"This is simple, well made and appears to be durable. The size means that I can sit in my favorite chair with my laptop. Other units that I have used were either larger than I wanted, or overly complicated and subject to breakage."
"If you're looking for something to keep your laptop cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend.."
"This is a very basic, functional backpack that does the job that it when designed for. Unlike other, more expensive models, this one does not have the feel or look of something that you would show off to your friends. However, it holds my 16 laptop quite well and has enough pockets to contain all of my usual travel gear. The material seems to be fairly durable but it makes a crinkly sound when touched or moved. This would be a good choice for a teenager who is hard on his belongings."
I purchase two of these backpacks for my wife and son's laptops. The case is well constructed and has many compartments. Its a great backpack for the price.
Love the backpack....lots of pockets for all my needs...when i travel it fits everything for my travel...makes a lot easier
Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. Otherwise great product
"The bag fits a 17.3 laptop quite snuggly, but it fits nonetheless. There is a considerable amount of space in each of the available sections, along several accessory pockets for those smaller items. The 2 mesh side pockets are big enough for a standard plastic water bottle, but not big enough for a nalgene water bottle.Taking it on a couple destinations so if there are any issues I find with it, I will edit my comments accordingly. As it stands now, good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops."
Love it
Great for the price It's much more durable than anything I could get at Walmart.
"The backpack is great quality. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I wouldn't trust the laptop slot alone to protect my laptop. It's not padded enough. If I had a choice I'd rather the laptop slot be replaced with a waterproof cooler space as I purchased this for hiking. That is my only gripe, other than that the bag is great quality, comfortable and has plenty of space. Well worth the price."
"Too many zippers IMO. Good quality, but the zippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open."
Amazing..... Sturdy and well pocketed.... Well worth the investment...very happy with this purchase. It has been holding up quite nicely.
"PROS:Well made/good constructionCompares very favorably to famous brand-name packsNo obvious brandingGreat attention to detailLarge main compartmentLots of subcompartmentsOrganizer for pens/sundries in the front compartmentCONS:Generic looksTop handle is minimally padded/perfunctoryStiff nylon in some interior parts makes an audible 'crinkly' sound when movedThe AmazonBasics Laptop Backpack is a well-made, fully featured backpack that can accommodate laptops up to 17 inches wide. This is a simply designed but good looking backpack that could meet most students' needs.The bag is basically a simple, but stylish enough design, with grey highlights and some orange piping on the front. There are enough characteristics to make the bag distinctive but there is no obvious branding on the front. If you look closely, you can find the Amazon basics logo embossed on the black zippers. But you'd have to look really closely. The shoulder straps are backed with a mesh-like material that reduces slippage and are sufficiently wide and padded so that they are comfortable.The main compartment is generous in size, open and closed with two zippers, and is basically broken up into two areas. The back area is generously padded on both sides and is meant to house the laptop. The padding is as good as or even more generous than what I have seen in standard backpacks made by companies like JanSport or L.L. Bean. There is a single large sleeve in front of the padding that is large enough to hold a standard, letter-sized manilla folder filled with papers. The front compartment is basically wide open and has room for traditional textbooks (assuming people still use these) or any other paraphernalia.There are two compartments in the front. There is mid-sized compartment that is in front of the main compartment and a smaller front compartment with the obligatory organizer/pockets to hold pens, a cellphone etc. There is even an internal clip in the front compartment for keys.Additionally, there are small mesh pockets on the sides of the pack and a quick-access, zippered pocket on the very top of the pack. There's even a small mesh pocket on the bottom of the left shoulder strap.Although I doubt that this is ballistic nylon, it appears to be very well made. The edges line up very well and there is no dog-earing in the fabric. The top handle is only minimally padded and a bit flimsy for a pack this size. Clearly, you could lift the pack via the handle to move it from the floor to your desk, but the handle isn't comfortable or sturdy enough to carry the pack like a suitcase. The nylon that makes up the dividers is stiff and makes an audible crinkly sound when manipulated. This likely will go away over time, but if you are late to class and walking into a quiet lecture hall this could be a distraction.The zippers move easily. They are large enough to grip and they all have nylon tags sewn to the end to make them easier to pull. The zippers seem strong enough for a pack of this size and caliber.All-in-all this is a very well made back pack at an excellent price point. It may not win major style points for some students, but it is a great basic backpack."
"I ordered this backpack in anticipation of a 10-day vacation to Universal Studios and a Royal Caribbean cruise. I needed something to carry my laptop where I could easily remove it for security, and that had lots of pockets for my travel papers and various things I needed to keep my 6yo busy.This AmazonBasics laptop is well-made and sturdy with a variety of pocket sizes and places to put stuff. Whatever material they used for the inside of the bag makes it very loud and crinkly, but also easy to clean. There is at least one pocket that seems extraneous and almost gets in the way, and when all the pockets are closed, there is an over abundance of zipper pulls. But the bag traveled very well and I like the sleeker style of it.The backpack is a bit much for everyday use (just in bulk and number of pockets, etc), but I'm happy to have it for future travels."
I was expecting the backpack to be a little flimsy consider the price but it's great. The padding for my back and the laptop pocket is nice and thick. There is even a secondary pocket on the front of the laptop pouch that can fit my 8 tablet. Overall I really like it because it has so many pockets and little compartments. The only bad thing I can see about it is how they made it so cheap is that the material inside for like the pockets and stuff is really flimsy so it'll be easily punctured by pens and pencils and stuff. For me though that's no big deal because the outside of it is sturdy and will keep my stuff safe.
"Very nice bag with lots of compartments and plenty of room for laptop, tablet, notebook, and accessories. I especially like cinch straps to adjust the width to your items. Top zippers were a little tight at first, but quickly loosened up."
"AmazonBasics delivers a top quality backpack for the price. I like all the different pockets to keep all my gear organized. The material used to make the backpack are light weight but very strong. Works great for traveling and held everything I needed to travel with. I recommend this backpack to anyone who travels with a large laptop, my 17 inch fit perfectly."
"This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone."
many department for my idems and is perfectly design fitted for my needs.
"Lots of pockets, but zipper covers actually make opening and closing a bit more difficult."
"Delivered as promised, well packaged ... only problem ... does NOT appear to be waterproof ... not a good thing with these heavy South Florida rains."
"There's a lot of space with the Amazon Basics laptop and a number of great compartments, but the material it's made from feels kind of stiff and inexpensive. I was impressed at how much I could get into this backpack, but once it was packed it felt very big and bulky. My normal backpack is a smaller one from Timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one."
"Even though this is classified as a laptop backpack, I'm really finding it much more useful as an all-purpose backpack. Of course, you could carry your laptop in it - there's a compartment specifically designed for one (17 or less) - but it's also comfortable and useful for general use.The backing is very sturdy. This sturdiness is designed to protect a laptop from tumbles and falls, but I love it for other reasons: First, I can throw all sorts of junk in this backpack (big books, a lunchbox, shoes, etc.) and nothing bulges from the back. This happens often with other backpacks, causing them to be difficult to carry, but the sturdy backing prevents this here. Second, it is quite comfortable. It's not a hard plastic backing, but just seems to be rigidly padded, and it almost feels like it's helping my posture when I wear it.My only complaint, and it isn't a big one, is that there are almost too many pockets and organizational compartments. It can get a bit complicated remembering where something is, especially if you have a lot of stuff. This may just take a bit more getting used to, however, and it doesn't diminish the fact that this is a really great backpack. In fact I'd add that all this extra room inside the backpack is a bonus. Yes, I am really quite liking this backpack."
"Pros- Feels Light weight even when stuffed fully. Perfect no. of compartments.Cons - Poor zipper quality, side ouch for water container is small."
Well made. Seems sturdy. Multiple compartments to store gear.Very price effective compared to other products made for the same uses.I'll see how it holds up with time.
"I'm a lifelong backpack user, starting back after WW2 when my father outfitted us all with Army surplus items. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to hike we go. Or snowshoe. Oh, it was a different world then, and I'm not saying better. The equipment was heavy and prone to mildew if you weren't careful, as it was all made of natural fiber with metal fittings. And they hadn't yet heard of ergonomicsHere we have yet another AmazonBasics product that is a winner. An improved, contemporary version of that old military surplus that first accompanied us into the woods - I've followed a lifetime of upgrades. This is a nice big bag with lots of pockets and zippers. Like most of today's technical products, it is a tradeoff between total protection and portability. So no, you wouldn't throw this with your laptop inside and expect complete protection. But it is made of high quality nylon and other tekkie fabrics, has adequate padding and well shaped, comfortable pack straps, a handle on top where it belongs, and more straps, buckles and pockets here and there. I love straps, buckles and pockets.It can be expected to be water resistant, although for extended use in rain you would need a separate rain cover made of coated waterproof nylon. This backpack has a very pleasing look, mostly black with orange accents and is a nice conservative shape. And it is a very good value, which you will discover if you go shopping at the well-known places for this kind of thing."
"Zipper on front kept coming apart. Since this opens to the base of the backpack, I almost lost an item. Double check this when you get it give it a few solid tugs"
"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect.

"Recently, I spent my hard earned money on a 13.3 Macbook Pro Mid 2012. I like to take care of my personal belongings, and this 1000 piece of machinery was no exception. So this began my search for a laptop sleeve. Wandering my local general stores (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc.) I noticed a cheap laptop sleeve (as in cheap quality) was nearly 16! I was like HECK NO! So I jumped on Amazon (btw amazon is the best shoutout to all the hard workers running this website and service) and searched a laptop sleeve. After approximately 9.24 seconds of searching I came across this gem. COULD IT BE! An affordable, durable, and classy laptop sleeve for under 10. Being the educated consumer I started to read reviews. I came across a few that said: Laptop Didn't Fit. This was it, this was the end, I built it all up to let myself down. But being the poor High-School student I am, I pocketed some of my parents lunch money and ordered it. When it got here I opened the package. You know the scene in Star Wars when Darth Vader removed his mask That's what it was like, shocking, but beautiful. I unboxed it and immediately took my laptop out of my backpack (which was stored in a nice soft tee-shirt previous to this sleeve purchase) and tried to slip it in the case. Wow. The sleeve fit like a glove.If you have a 13.3 Macbook Pro Mid 2012, I highly recommend this product. It protects your laptop very well and snug. No other sleeve is as affordable, fashionable, and durable as this one."
"Recently, I spent my hard earned money on a 13.3 Macbook Pro Mid 2012. I like to take care of my personal belongings, and this 1000 piece of machinery was no exception. So this began my search for a laptop sleeve. Wandering my local general stores (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc.) I noticed a cheap laptop sleeve (as in cheap quality) was nearly 16! I was like HECK NO! So I jumped on Amazon (btw amazon is the best shoutout to all the hard workers running this website and service) and searched a laptop sleeve. After approximately 9.24 seconds of searching I came across this gem. COULD IT BE! An affordable, durable, and classy laptop sleeve for under 10. Being the educated consumer I started to read reviews. I came across a few that said: Laptop Didn't Fit. This was it, this was the end, I built it all up to let myself down.

"The larger one was bought for me as part of a Christmas gift...I enjoyed mine so much that I bought this one for a birthday gift.....sturdy, stylish, padded and protects well. Good buy for the price"
For the price very good value and its lasting well
"holds everything laptop,amp,mini external memory drive,headphones,3d glasses,tablet cables,and still have 2 extra pockets awesome,well made product. thank you !"
"Very nice product for the money. Only use it once a week, should last long time, would buy again."
I purchased this case based on appearance and quality as shown on the picture with details. I was even more impressed upon arrival. The case has everything I need. A separate compartment for my A/C power cord. The padding is well constructed to protect my Notebook Computer. Well worth every cent I paid. I am extremely please by all the features.
"Was not what I expected, he price was so low that I expected a, runner-up, type of bag but this is perfect. Delighted with it."
"This is a quality product, well constructed with durable materials. Many pockets for laptop accessories or other supplies. Sometimes I use it as just a briefcase and it also serves that purpose well. All in all, it's a great value for a reasonably low price."
I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens.
"Cheap but doesn't appear it particularly. Does it's job fine, plenty of pockets and space, much prefer it to the back pack style"
"I needed a reasonable laptop bag and got this.On arrival I put my dell Inspiron laptop inside and the charger went in the front pocket. Inside the laptop slips in the middle then your are able to put a ipad and maybe a diary either side. As there is a slide pocket each side of the laptop.It's actually well made surprisingly and the handles on top are nice and comfortable to use/hold.The strap that goes over the should is nice, maybe could of had more padding on the shoulder strap.The reason for 4 stars is that I think the case should have more padding to protect your electrical device.It's a very nice bag and I do recommend it and for the price it is great."
"Having looked elsewhere for this product and found them really expensive, found this on Amazon at a fantastic price and was really pleased with it."
I am a Verizon Technician and this laptop case is perfect for what I do!! Thank you!
Very well constructed and reasonably priced.
Everything was great and I like it very much
buy it not bad for the price at worth it !!
"Fits well, small from outside but inside it is big, thanks"
"I liked this item for the price,quality and usability. Ideal for Laptops, tablets,paperwork and sandwiches.It comes with carry handle or Over the shoulder straps. Quality from Amazon"
love it so far. No problems.
fab case for any laptop would buy another again i got it for my laptop and it is fine and strong plenty of pockets
"This bag is really great value for money, giving you everything you could want for carrying your laptop and accessories."
"arrived on time well packed disappointed with quality does the job it was only for keeping dust off second laptop,a very tight fit though"
"I have the Western Digital My Passport Ultra 2TB USB 3.0 Portable Drive 2.5 (laptop size) external hard drive. The hard drives case is mostly plastic with a thin pretty metal sheet top that's more for aesthetics than protection. I originally bought the matching extra-tough pod like WD Nomad Rugged case that offers great protection. Once fitted into the Nomad, the drive stays in the sealed protective case with only the USB3 port accessible behind a rubber flap - and given the light-weight feel of the WD Passports plastic drive case the extra protection of the Nomad was reassuring. However there's a big negative negative in that the case has nowhere to store the short 40cm USB3 cable (plus the Nomad pod hides the drive LEDs). As an alternative I tried this cheap Amazon Basic 2.5 external hard drive case.The AmazonBasics case is less ruggedised, but the My Passport Ultra drive fitted the case perfectly, and very usefully the case has plenty of space for storing the USB3 cable (it fits in behind a netted pocket on the top flap). The hard drive itself is held in by a strap to prevent the drive slipping out when you open the case. Laptop size 2.5 hard drives have extra shock protection over their 3.5 desktop versions, being designed for portable use, so this AmazonBasics case offers more than adequate protection when traveling (I slip my case into the backpack when commuting). I now find I'm using the case in preference to the Nomad version simply as it's far more convenient for keeping tabs on the drive's USB3 cable. This AmazonBasics case works well, seems well made, and it's very cheap at 7, so 5* for function and value."
"I read the review that says it is NOT like the one pictured, and as far as my order goes, that is a false statement. The case is EXACTLY like the ones Amazon offers, just cheaper and with free shipping. Perfect deal. I can't complain."
Case is well made and fits my WD Passport drive perfectly with enough room for the usb cable.
It is a good little hard case to protect your external hard drives
Works as intended. Safety for hard drive that stores my photos.
Isn't the same as the picture.
This folder also expands on the bottom. Will allow A LOT more than when the bottom does not expand. Bought a second. I recommended this to my friends.
Exactly what I needed.
Nice product. Will work perfectly for my projects. Nice and sturdy. Thank you!
A useful folder organizer with good quality.
"I love the portability of this expandable file good quality, good cost. I recommend"
Exactly what I needed!!!!
Good product cheap price! Very happy with my purchase..
A very good document storage grat
Very sturdy and functional.
I replaced my cat's x-large litter box to this smaller sized litter box... It's easy to clean and takes less kitty litter to fill it which I like
"Great price, good value!"
It seems to work just like any other usb plug in charger.
got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire
Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly!
I was in line at a store where a elder women was trying to return a Amazon tablet. The customer service rep told her she used a charging block that had caused damage to the tablet and it wasn't covered for replacement. I happy to purchase a charging block that was made for my device.
Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package
I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/
Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great.
This product works just as well as the higher-priced ones from the cell phone company.
Bought this to use with my kindle voyage and I love it. It charges my Kindle in 3 hours or less sometimes and the battery lasts for weeks.
"Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger."
Charges all my items extra fast. Love it when I'm short on time
Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This wall charger works exactly as described for the Kindle Paperwhite.
"I assumed this item would have a cord with the plug. Never assume. It was the plug only. The cord on my 7"" Kindle is very short so I bought a 4 foot cord also. Now I keep the shorter cord with me so I can charge on the go, the longer cord and new plug are what I use at home. Satisfied"
"pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand"
My son and I bought my wife the Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and she loves it! This charger is great for trips where we need a charge in the vehicle or while visiting relatives!
Bought this for my new Kindle since they no longer come with chargers. It's fast and can be used for my phone.
"Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up."
This is the third I have had to buy/ They seem to only work for a year before needing to be replaced. I have the warranty but no patience for the replacement to be mailed to me with all the forms.
Love it. Best charger I ever bought. Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone.
This charger is improved from the other one I had. It takes less time to fully charge and the charge lasts longer.
Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well.
I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable.
Hey--It works. I prefer to get a battery recharge direct from the source instead of from my computer. The cord is convenient.
Wall charger is convenient. Just wish it was sold with the kindle instead of having to purchase it separate. Seems like it should be standard in the package. Had to purchase in a bundle in order to get it included with kindle.
Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!
Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable
it does not charge any faster than regular charger.
"The only problem that I had is that it should have been included with the Kindle Paperwhite. There is no way to charge the Paperwhite unless you buy the charger. The charging port on the Paperwhite is so small that nothing that I already have will work. Kindle does not even provide a USB cable so that you can charge from your computer. The outlet plug is cheep plastic (hollow) and will probably break, no warranty."
It does what it is suppose to. No problems with it...
Exactly what I needed. Didn't want to settle for a generic off brand charger. Thanks to Best Buy I didn't have to.
"This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily"
"I purchased this wall charger because I have had issues with Samsung and other Kindle chargers. So far, this charger is great. Devices charge rapidly."
"I gave this Amazon charger only four stars, because even though it does a great job of charging my new Paperwhite quickly it should be included with the reader and not sold separately."
Works good for a plug in for the kindle fire that I bought
just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.
"Replacement charger for my son's Kindle, works great, highly recommended."
"Hey it's only a wall charger...Hey it's only a wall charger...Hey it's only a wall charger... Yet to fail, nough said."
"I travel internationally at least once a year and wanted an EASY way to charge my Kindle Fire HD. The design of this system is great. It's one basic plug and cord with changeable heads. It's easy to use and easy to pack. I tried out the European head recently in Norway and it worded great. Some voltage converter + plug adapter sets don't work well there because the Norwegian outlets are deep. This worked perfectly. I also bought this set because it had a U.S. plug and I can charge quickly here at home. There have been some criticisms that the country name isn't printed on the plug head, but the set comes with an extensive list of which heads are needed for which countries, which I find to be adequate. A great product."
"Works on my kindle, Samsung Galaxy Note and my IPod Touch!!! Love this multi-funtional charger! I didn't need the international kit but i wasn't sure...maybe on day it will come in handy."
"I recently went out of the country and took this charging kit with me. Changing the different plugs adapters was extremely easy, and I had no problems with the setup and charging my Kindle. In fact the charger that is included in this kit is a slightly larger wattage than the adapter that came with my Fire HDX, which allowed for faster charging. Since returning home, I have attached the US 110W adapter and am using it as an additional adapter. The one issue that would have made this item better would have been if they had included a carrying bag for the adapters. Yes, I'd love a nice carrying case, but even if that wasn't an option, having a cloth bag with a draw string would have been preferable since some people may need multiple adapters when the travel."
"As abv, takes 3 + hours to fully charge. I hoped it would be much faster (maybe an hour), to the point that I had thought I got a lemon. People were kind enough to answer my question, and learned that I should not expect miracles, lol. Apart from that, good thing it comes with the cord, and is compact enough."
"I do a lot of international travelling, so I have bought just about every conversion and adapter kit on the market. This is the best-made and most versatile I have seen to charge electronic devices, including but not limited to the Kindles. It is a powerful 9 watts and will work safely on any device using a micro-B USB charging port. It can also be used with non-standard devices, like Apple products or older electronics having mini-B ports, as long as you have the appropriate USB cord for it. It can be used in almost every country (the standard European C plug can be used in most outliers like the South American countries and Israel because their plugs are dual type).The charger is as small as it could be for such a powerful charger, is very durable, and compact. I like it because the interchangeable plugs actually form part of the charger. I have a bad tendency to leave adapters in the wall socket and just remove my US charger. The next hotel guest gets a free adapter.This is at a new price of 29.99(10 less than before). This makes it a very good value, considering the design and quality. Unlike the standard PowerFast charger for the Kindle Fire, this kit comes with a USB cord, so it is complete. An added bonus is that the adapters can twist on in any direction, so you can position the USB cord on the side, top or bottom."
It slippes around on pan handle
I wanted a new cord for my kindal and I wanted one like the one that came with my kindal. This was not what was as described. It's not white or anything like the original. It did ship quickly. I seldom write reviews I like my privacy.
"Exactly what I needed. Works well. good length cord, good value and got here quickly."
Wow! This charger is amazing! It charges like lightning! None of my old chargers can hold a candle to this one. Usually charges within 10 and 30 minutes. Nice length on cord. Quality is outstanding! Would I recommend this product Absolutely!
Worked on an android phone on a recent trip when a friend forgot their charger. Works great on my Kindle Fire as well ! Just what I needed!
Works great for my Kindle!!!
Kindle Power Adapter Wall Charger USB cable arrived sooner than expected and in excellent condition. Exactly what I was looking for.
This was exactly what I needed. Knew I would find it on Ebay. Good price too!
"I Could not be more thrilled to find a new cord for my very old Kindle reader. ,Speed of shipping awesome and quality great"
"When I got my Kindle Fire, I got a protective cover for it and figured I'd be ok, because I don't travel much at all (am bedridden/disabled from car accidents). After a while, I couldn't get the mini-USB cord to stay in the plug on the Kindle. After describing the problem to Amazon, they sent me a new cord (I got the newer one with an AC plug and had to pay for it). Unfortunately this did not solve the problem, and I had to mail them my Kindle, and they shipped me a new one, configured mostly the way I had everything before I sent it, which was very convenient. Using my new cable (purchased through the Amazon Kindle store), I had no problems, at first.With only very light use, primarily for reading books for short intervals, the problem I had before with the mini USB plug on the Kindle not fitting tightly into its socket. After changing up AC to USB, as well as trying both USBs on my computer, I was unable to get the Kindle to start because it had less than 15 charge on the battery but I had no way to charge it. The only way to resolve the issue would be to go through the procedure described above I read a number of the positive reviews (which are usually posted first), and nothing was mentioned about this problem--there were so many reviews I didn't have the time to go through them all. I'm in the middle of a book, and use the Kindle to play Scrabble with a friend, and we're in the middle of a game...So I haven't decided what to do yet... It's after 5 a.m. Sunday morning so I can't call the Kindle Store for advice.I had been considering upgrading to one of the new Kindle products, but after having this recurring problem, I am leery of spending that kind of money, only to possibly have the same issue.Read more"
"We have several echoes and dots throughout our house, we use it to listen to music, check the weather, traffic, adjust settings on our smart home devices, create shopping lists, use it as a kitchen timer, check facts, use as an intercom, phone family, as a bedside alarm, listen to music throughout the house, and the list just goes on and on. It really is a personal assistant, new skills are appearing every day and It's fun finding new things she can do and answer. Ever expanding knowledge base and skills are the biggest feature, not likely to become obsolete very soon ....."
"The Amazon Echo is a really fun thing to play with. We always try to find new things to say to it which would make it say something funny. The Echo has been the most helpful in our home for creating shopping lists for everyone in the house with a phone. If any of us find ourselves at the store, we know what the others want. Shopping on Amazon is really easy and fun as well. There's a whole bunch of apps so it won't be hard for you to find what will make the Echo useful to you specifically. We love it. I couldn't recommend it more."

"Great value. The Alexia unit makes it super fast and easy to listen to nearly any type of music, with an exceptionally high level of fidelity for such a small unit. The AI makes fun to talk to and can give seemingly any information available on the internet, just by asking."
"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!"

"We have two Amazon Echo's and both work flawlessly!Easy to set up, great for all around use, constantly add new features."
"I own two echos and 1 amazon firetv. Alexa is on all. Echo is great if.... you DO subscribe to Amazon Prime Membership and get the free music that comes with it. (Prime comes with 250 song limit) I also have added the extra 250,000 songs for 29 and now have uploaded over 13,000 songs of my own. I don't need to listen to the music I can't stand! 50's 60's some 70's and 80's are what I want and instrumentals Mantovani, 101 strings, Paul Mauriat, Herb Alpert, etc sound great on it.Just have to say: Alexa, shuffle Neil Diamond, Alexa, shuffle Petula Clark, Alexa, play Sound of Music, Alexa, what is the temperature. Alexa, score Cubs etc. You get the idea. You can set multiple alarms up to 24 hours in advance, You can ask for Motels and Hotels around Dubuque, IA. How many days till Christmas (or any date you ask for). I fall to sleep every night with Alexa, play Streams and Birds. She will then play a water stream with birds singing. or whatever you want to hear such as rainforest, thunder and rain, frogs along the Mississippi, etc. They ARE part of my life now. I sit outside and listen to whatever type of music I'm in the mood for. It must have a WIFI connection to be used, and some type of pad, Kindle fire, ipad, phones, etc. to set it up to your (or anyones) WIFI. You must download the Alexa App (free on Amazon), to set it up with your home location, and your WIFI. If you unplug it from one outlet in your home and want to take it outside, as long as it can still get WIFI, all you have to do is plug it in and it will find your wifi again. I just can't say enough about how I like it and it WILL be getting a lot better as they are still upgrading them.Read full review..."
"I like the amazon echo, but it needs more improvements. It does not understand many things you ask. it does not connect to all my wemo devices however, it is good at what it does. the sound quality is the best it offers. I like the local weather and 7 day weather and news. With my amazon prime, my music is played and sounds great. Some might say it is too high a price to pay, however i bought it for 150.00 barely used and glad i purchased it."
"This is my 5th Alexa that I purchased for my home. I love it and place them in every room in the house. I highly recommend the 1st generation Alexa as it is the best sounding of them all. I have also purchased the newer one and the quality of sound was not near the Alexa 1st generation. I am now purchasing for Christmas gifts. Grab the 1st generation Alexa while you can before you can no longer get them. Sounds great, ease of use extremely easy and connection with great ease."
"It has a surprisingly quick response to the queries that it does recognize. I found its necessary to be rather specific in the way commands are phrased. Also a good bit of set up is involved, including subscription and agreeing to terms and conditions that nobody ever reads. And even then, it seems copyright laws limit the echo.I would like to be able to promt a command with something I choose as apposed to saying Alexa every time. It seems with something so adaptable, this would be easy to make available. Perhaps it is and I simply haven't found how yet.All around fun device, with good quality sound. And with the purchase of the battery adapter base, it's portable to wherever Wi-Fi is available.Thousands of apps skills are available for the echo. Virtually endless fun."
"I didn't have time to play with all the features, but I love this thing! The voice is so clear and doesn't sound robotic. I can't wait to try other features that my echo has.."
"The Amazon Echo has a lot of potential. I believe after a few more years of development the Echo will be amazing. I can't wait for the Echo to add flight arrival and departure information (all transportation info in general), cooking recipes, and generally have all the information of Wikipedia.... now that would be great! It's a good start, but has a ways to go.Owen"
"With the new update allowing hands-free ""Hey Alexa"" commands, this is a great device. The battery allows you to disconnect from the wall. The sound is very good and fills a small room well with decent levels. Alexa is very accurate (most of the time) to voice commands. My only complaint is that Bluetooth streaming from devices (like my iPhone or iPad) sometimes breaks up and stutters a bit. Other than that, I think this is a great device."
Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!
It works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary
Works as well as the Echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it. Battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good. Easy to move around in and out of the house. Will work anywhere you have WIFI. If you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive Echo.
"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """
"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,"
This is a must for Prime members great sound and can be used as Bluetooth speaker to boot.
"Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it."
Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....
This has all the benefits of the Echo for a slightly better price. I also love the portability.
Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.
I absolutely love my amazon echo. It is very convenient and handy.
Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!
Cute speaker. a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it
Love all the features that come with this speaker. Alexa function by tapping device is a nice change of pace from the always listening echo and dot! Above avarage sound on the go and got a great deal on it!
Before I bought this I had a blue tooth speaker and an iPod touch. Both of which had to be charged and turned on etc. now I just tell Alexa to play music.
We really enjoy our Alexa. I always have it for music. Lately we been movie times. The kids like to ask it silly questions and they can't get enough of it
"i got one for my mom she's 90 years young and she sits and listens to it all day, she;s got the amazon tap i got my draugther the dot and i got my self another tap. i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better. my grand kids love playing ganes with alexa. like i said every household need one"
"Amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the AWS engine behind it, there's a lot of opportunity for development, both from the community as well as Amazon. Naturally they favor interaction with services they sell, so others will need to build links to others, but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already. The price of this TAP was outstanding, adding it to my existing ECHO and now considering a DOT."
Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.
"This little speaker is way better that her mother. after that update making it hand free, i recommend to anyone."
"I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it."
This is everything the echo is but portable. You're not getting the same sound quality but more than enough for the backyard or beach. A recent update was made to give you the option of using the button or voice activated controls.
"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up."
"My family and I are enjoying Alexa. Great for playing music, setting timers, adding to shopping list, etc. Still finding new and useful things to do with it."
"The Tap works great, just like Alexa's little helper."
"Great item, good service from Best Buy. It is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often."
I literally use this thing every single day. Love it.
Love being able to use Alexa unplugged. Amazing device!
"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge."
"Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button"
I purchased the Amazon Tap when it was on sale for around $80. The sound is amazing (unlike my Amazon Echo it has stereo speakers!) and the battery life is great! It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can stream from the internet or from your mobile device. Highly recommended!
The sound out of this little cylinder is incredible.
So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all
"Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask ""her"" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have ""her"" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device."
"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing."
"Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!"
"I really like the sound of the tab. The only complaint is that you have to push the button every time you have to speak or listen to tab. Unlike the echo, where you just speak and it answers without pushing any buttons. The echo has a cheaper sounding speaker. I'd wait till there is a sale in it before paying full price. Otherwise, it is just like a Bluetooth speaker."
Amazon Tap is exactly what I expected it would be. The sound quality is good with the Alexa features. I love that you can charge it on the base or with micro USB cord. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Amazon Echo and would like the portability.
"best portable speaker I've ever owned. I use this everyday, mostly when getting ready in the morning or when I have guests over. Good sound quality and links to the Alexa app just like an Echo. It come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the Echo. Also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord."
Great product for when you are on the go.great sound
Has good sound for little speaker & good for getting information with out getting up.
I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy
I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.
I like the Amazon Tap because it is portable. I have used it several times and it makes things a lot easier.
I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price
Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.
purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.
The Tap is a great companion to your every day business. It has become my partner in my daily communications.
This portable Bluetooth speaker has an excellent sound which can be taken anywhere unlike the Echo and Echo Dot which both have to be plugged in. Want to listen to a favorite song? Just ask Alexa. Want to know the weather report? Just ask Alexa. Want to know your horoscope? Just ask Alexa. A lot of fun and entertainment at a great price. Big things come in small packages!
Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.
"I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!"
"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot."
"Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great."
Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody
"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks."
Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.
"A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price."
"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase."
Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend
Awesome. I really enjoy using it. The portability is a plus!
got as a gift. Might not have got for my self- but love it and glad I had a birthday - lol
I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate
I use this for setting alarms and reminders and for activating my lifX lights. The set up is super easy and sound quality and volume levels are really good too
"other than not being voice activated like the Echo, it's just as good if not better"
"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!"
"WAS SURPRISED HOW GREAT THIS WORKS , MUSIC ASK IT QUESTIONS AWESOME"
"Wife loves it! Great sound, great technology! Compact and durable."
Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun
"very interesting device, but having to touch button is a pain sometimes.if that would bother you, then go with Echo."
"Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you."
"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift."
Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.
We really love our new Amazon Tap. My Son enjoys playing with it.
My 8 yr old daughter loves her Tap. She uses it for HW and play. Never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her Tap.
This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.
Even as a speaker alone this item is worth the price!
This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.
Awesome speaker easy to set up. Easy to play. Great by the pool
"Has great sound, clarity,alexia has great responses"
I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.
It is a quality product and has clear crisp sound. Best part it can be carried in any satchel. Sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering.
I wanted to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use while out as well as at home. The tap has great sound quality and Alexa is more useful than I would have thought.
"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra."
"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!"
"If you have an Amazon Echo already then you know what a great gadget it is. This is Echo in baby size and portable. The newer version can be ""woken up"" with your voice like its big sister or you can program it to only respond when you push the mike button. It had all the features of Echo and excellent sound for its size. I have it in the bedroom and use it as an alarm and music when I get dressed. All in all a great item for the price."
I believe this is the best Amazon device because of the portability. Quality seems good. Works well with no problems so far. It's a great portable Bluetooth speaker with alexa.
Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!
Truly amazing combination of portability and ease of use and good sound.
"Best purchase made. Best thing I like is that its portable and the battery life is very reasonable. Another practical idea is when there a group of wanting to talk to a family member that couldnt make to a family gathering, we sit around the table, Set the TAP in the middle and we can all have a conversation, at night I can have Alexa play some easy listening music after a hectic day."
This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.
This product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations. While it is an option I prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command. That way its not listening till I tell it to unlike Google's device and the other amazon devices.
"Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its ""Hands-Free"" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)..."
Love having someone to take notes for me and play music on demand.
Enjoying my Amazon Tap portable Bluetooth and Wi-F Speaker. It's everything I thought it would be an MORE!
We bought this product to compliment our other amazon product for its portability.
We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.
I like the product itself but its app is very slow esp. outside the U.S. when you are on the go.
"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget."
Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.
I would recommend it. It is fun to use and puts out good sound.
"Great sound, almost perfect interactions and portable. I have the dot and now the tap. The new update allowing voice activation is awesome. Great toy!"
I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use.
Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn't paired.
This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.
We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.
I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.
Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.
Does as advertise. Good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers.
Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.
Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound
great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside. the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one!
Enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good.
"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base."
"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apps better."
"I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forcast and local events. Great purchase."
I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack
We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.
"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one."
"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR"
"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house."
This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.
The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.
"I love that this works just like the dot, which I already have 3. However in addition it is portable and has better speaker"
Great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway.
"The Amazon Tap is a great mobile Bluetooth speakers, if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system. The produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the Echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the Echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work)."
"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn."
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.
The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.
Great additional piece to go with Echo. If you want a additional unit you can't beat this product and the price!
Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.
I love the Amazon Tap. The sound is great and it's completely portable. It lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate. Excellent product for the money!
"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up."
"Bought this for my boyfriend, he LOVES it! He takes it on every trip we go on. It's so powerful for such a small speaker! I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort."
Great product works direct with internet access or through your phone
Looked at the Echo before we bought this and I would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable. This has everything we need and then some.
The ease of Alexa in performing functions is second to none. SIRI who?
"This is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa. I use it to stream Spotify, Pandora andESPN Radio. Small speaker fills the Garage like a concert hall. Battery last 8 hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use."
"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight."
Fun new product. Great gift idea especially if you aren't good with technology.
Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.
"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing."
"Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it."
"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!"
Fun gadget for adults and kids. Great range for asking questions..
I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.
Very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online. It sounds very good for it's size.
My son requested this a a birthday gift. He is enjoying it everyday.
Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.
"I have the echo, the dot and now the tap. The sound is good. Better than the dot but not as good as the echo. The thing the tap has over the echo and dot is its portability. Which is nice not have to be next to a plug all the time. I would recommend it."
We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.She loves it, easy to use, speakers are more clear than her other devices Great volume"
Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.
My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.
"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room."
Good product works amazing . Works awesome from home .
Good sound quality. Charging dock is an added advantage.
"Good, but not overall as capable or comprehensive as I was hoping. Will continue to explore capabilities and Apps."
I like the Amazon Tap. I use it as a speaker in my garage for working out. It is tied to my Amazon Echo. I am able to use Alexa and Amazon Prime material. Would highly recommend.
Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.
"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!"
"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do."
For its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and I love the portability.
"Gave as a gift.Did not know you had to ""tap"" it before you talk. Thought it was like echo.Anyway, they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk.Really likes that it is battery powered, portable."
"Using it in the kitchen mainly. It has good sound, works excellent as a cooking timer. Also alarm for certain events thruout the day. Nice music source."
I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.
If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.
good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.
"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!"
"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass."
"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!"
Great service I loved all of the items and were great gifts
I love this speaker it works wonderfully. Very recommend
I Luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to
Love it's portability and and sound love all my Amazon echo items
"Overall I was a little skeptical because this wasn't the product I wanted. Turns out, it's amazing!"
Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!
This is such a great product I have two of them! Would highly recommend.
Wait for to be on sale it's worth it definitely you will love it
"Works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like, just found out it supports dish network"
"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options"
"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!"
"I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!"
We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.
"This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household."
The tap is amazing. portable and connected to all amazon content
"If you dont need the voice activation of Alexa, or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you, consider the Tap. Almost all of the functionality of Alexa, but in a smaller ( and less expensive ) version.Great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives."
I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is
The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it
Amzon tap is great and fun Bluetooth speaker with inbuilt Alexa. I can talk it to end of the room and it can still understand my commands and plays music. Cool device and I highly recommend it.
Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.
"I love this product , so nice to have for trips!!!"
"I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day."
Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.
"I have several echo dots around my home, but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn't have one and control things around the house, listen to the news or music. It holds a great charge."
"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only..."
Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa
Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.
We bought to give away at a Halloween party. We own them ourselves and they are awesome
Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!
Camera was perfect for my daughter... she's in yearbook at school and fell in love with it...
I have the have the Echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home. Especially if I'm working in the garage and want to listen to music
"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word ""Alexis"", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household."
"great device to listen to music,best blue tooth on the market today,I highly recommend it"
I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.
I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.
"Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price"
Really enjoy the interface and how integrate with the amazon music service .....great
"I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use ""Always On"" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using ""Always On"" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere"
"Overall, I am very impressed with the Amazon Tap. The sound quality isn't the best out there, but the portability makes up for this. The volume is decent as well. There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase."
The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.
This worked well as an extension of the Amazon Echo to cover our basement living area.
sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi'sseems durable
"I am a huge fan of the echo. That being said this is the last one I would buy. The original echo's speaker sounds much better and is hands free. The dot has great connection Bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system. I bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard. The sound is not as robust as the original echo (not portable - no internal battery), but good enough when in the yard to at least have music."
works as expected. great Christmas present for the kids.
Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price
It helps the kids with questions it plays any music you like .
"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker."
"great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request."
I love using this as a speaker for my MacBook. I keep it in my office and use it daily!
"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too."
Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.
The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?
Didn't want to spend $200 on the Echo for someone who's not use to using a Bluetooth speaker. Great buy and functions well.
"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo."
"I bring it when hanging out outside, exercising, doing housework anywhere my echo won't hear me"
"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!"
"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing."
"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week."
"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL."
It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.
"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice."
"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use."
I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.
Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.
"I( read the reviews and even listened to this in store. But much to my chagrin, at high volume, this will not cut it. The portability is great!"
I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap
I purchased this for my son's birthday.. he loved it..
I've enjoyed using the features Alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers. The sound quality is good.
"This is a great buy for music, news and any kind of information you want."
Great product for intro to an AI device. Cant wait to upgrade to echo.
"If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers."
"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach."
Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!
Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.
The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.
"This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it."
"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account."
"I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!"
"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!"
"excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again"
"This device can be a very load speaker, I mean really LOUD. It also can access AMAZON prime service without a computer. I like this little Tap."
This is the echo you can take anywhere. Runs on battery and can connect via bluetooth when away from wifi.
"Much more than a Bluetooth speaker. It is great to listen to music from Pandora, Amazon, etc with it streaming directly from wifi. Saves the battery on my phone. As others have said I wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but I guess they didn't put that in to save battery life. Maybe something for the next generation TAp"
"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug."
"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking."
Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.
Good price works great would buy again good value for the price
I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.
Nice price for a gift idea at the time. Small compact version of Alexa.
Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.
"I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy."
Bought it for Father's Day and my dad and mom love it!
"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house."
For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.
"Fun and easy to use, install app and navigation.Good quality technology."
Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment
Great speaker. Love how its portable. Good battery life. Would be 5 stars if it had the drop in capabilities like the rest of the echo family.
I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked
I gave this to my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a portable speaker. I thought the addition of Alexa would be fun. She loves it. She said the sound is really great.
"I have a regular echo and now the tap. Both awesome products, use them to control lights, locks, and play music. Would buy again."
I have an Amazon Echo and an Amazon Dot. Love the functionality. Decent sound for what they are. I just wanted something portable for outside.
I wanted the technology but didn't want something that listens to the ever-present conversation in my home. The Amazon Tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen.It works and works very well.
Love the speaker and the assistance of Alexa. Was trying to choose between this and a regular Bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs.
"Love the Tap, plays my daughter' s music. Works well if you are a Amazon Prime member."
Makes for a great alarm and reminder device. I own 2 dots and the tap. Use them all.
No issues at all... wish it were water proof. My kids and family love it.
Sleep design and works great. Ideal gift for the person who has everything.
Smaller version but works great just like the bigger product.
The product it amazing love that it turns in lights on and plays my favorite music.
This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it
"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile."
This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.
This speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it's got the Alexa application!
"We already had an Alexa but this one is a great addition. It's portable, rechargeable and good sound."
Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!
If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.
you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it Plays all my music
Great product with a ton of features. Add the Echo Dot to get even more out of it
Love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms. Has a decent amount of Bass for the size.
Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.
"I bought it for my husband for a gift but I use it as much as he does. Perfect size, good sound quality overall great product."
"I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!"
Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.
"The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to ""tap"" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable."
Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!
"Best sounding Amazon speaker hands down. The only annoyance is that it beeps after the ""Alexa"" wake word and after the command, unlike the other echos I have with no obvious way to turn this off. Other than that, sounds great and can take with you pretty well anywhere...."
I really enjoy it love the sound and it's really easy
I'm amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and I recommend it
The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!
This is a great product! Would definitely recommend this item!
"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device."
This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.
This speaker sound great. I was surprised at how loud it gets. The sound is clear and you also have Alexa so that's a win.
Great speaker sound and ease of setup. Works great with Amazon music option.
"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base."
I am enjoying the Tap very much. Lot's to do and play with on the app. Still finding new things it can do daily. Great sound quality to play my music. I only wish that it had a better search engine.
I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.
I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!
"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess."
Great sound quality from such a small item. Easy to hide so it's not noticeable.
"I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions. Additional voice features I use are news reports, weather forecasts, and control of WeMo switches in my home. Overall a great buy."
"Speaker is really cool. Sounds great, easy to use. Love the fact that it is portable. Only downside I see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button (not always listening)"
Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!
"The Tap has been wonderful! We use it as a timer, for a weather update and for general music. The sound is terrific. I would recommend this unit. It is certainly easy to use - just a tap away."
"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly."
This Alexa is a super form of info with little wait time.
Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!
Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.
Brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Great product for the price.
Great speaker and Echo substitute. This is great for on the go as a Bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the Alexa app.
I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound
Love it great speaker as long as u have access to WiFi
"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo."
This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass)
We use this speaker all the time. It's perfect. I would buy this time and time again.
"Works great if you plan to have it in arms reach. You have to physically tap it to ask Alexa. Store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap, not voice activate. Returned to wait for indefinite out-of-stock Echo to get in eventually."
Sounds great. Must touch to activate. Easy to use.
"I have not had such a reliable speaker before. It is so easy to charge, and so easy to start playing songs right away. With Alexa, you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone, unlocking it, and pulling up Google.com. Love it."
Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that
"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device."
"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone."
Took awhile to get connected to my home wifi but now that it is it streams flawlessly with no lags in music. Doesn't have the dynamic sound range as other Bluetooth speakers i own.
Great tech works well highly recommended no issues
"Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc."
I like it because we move it around the house &I to the garage and pool area.
"Unlike the larger version, this does not need to be plugged in..making it portable....although you have to press the button for every request..it's great to take with you where ever you go..fully rechargable"
"I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use."
"Easy setup, love that its wireless and its fun talking to Alexa as she gives excellent information."
"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do ‚Äì including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source."

It's great just wish it did not need a button to work. Otherwise love it!
"This product works great as a little helper and as a great speaker for music. I purchased this for my mother in a nursing home, she loves it! It is very easy to set up and use."
Went with the portable unit for travel. Easy access and portability.
I first boughy alezxa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking
This is one of the coolest new inventions around. It is very innovative and works great. It's really neat asking Alexa to play different songs and telling it you are bored.
"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!"
"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem."
Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal
I really liked this tablet. Got it for my nephew who just turned 4. Has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained. The bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too. What I also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too.
"Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!"
This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out
"You know, for about a year now I've been thinking of getting a portable speaker, so when the Tap was on sale I decided that this was the perfect answer since I was already committed to the Alexa paradigm."
"Great product at a great price from Best Buy. Have to press a button rather than just saying her name, but that's the price you pay for it being cordless."
"It has sleep timer capability alarm I use it at work, or use it at home while I'm in the shower and I'll bring it to Friends houses and we use Alexa to gain information or just have fun. quality a 9 its loud too."
I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.
"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music."
This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button
"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most."
Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.
It is a very handy device and I highly recommend it. I also enjoy using Alexa on it.
"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want."
Amazon is the tip of leading technology. Always have had great luck with their product.
"I didn't want something that was always monitoring room conversations. This appears to only listen when I tap it, and that is much more acceptable to me. Works great. :-)"
I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.
"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it"
"I really like my Tap very much. It great when it's connected. Reads me news, weather, plays music and can purchase items from Amazon That being said, I do have some connectivity problems while on wifi. I don't want to say that it's the taps fault as it may be my wifi. I don't regret my purchase. It has great sounds and recognizes my voice commands well."
"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine."
This speaker is great for the price. I love how the speaker is 360 degrees so you get the same sound in any part of the room.
With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.
I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where
"The more I use this, the more reasons I enjoy it. The staff were great and helped me set it up."
"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund"
It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift.
It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.
"Doesn't understand some commands or Questions,but good overall"
I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.
Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...
"Now that you don't have to actually tap it to get the full function out of it, its great. Have the original Echo, and the Dot also. Wish I had only bought two of these, the charge is great and we take it wherever we want to go."
It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.
I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo
"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution."
Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!
Now that this supports hands free access and amazon has discontinued it this is the last chance to get a battery operated echo device.
"If your looking for great sound it cannot perform but the versatility is worth the compromise, Lacks base or I would rate it as excellent."
"I have an echo, tap and a dot. Currently my tap serves as a Bluetooth speaker for my dot - making it more like the echo, but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere. It has really good sound much like my echo. It also works great in the app and syncs with all my other products."
I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.
"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!"
"This is a fun and convenient toy, but I'm surprised about some of the limitations. I keep hearing the same NPR news clip when I ask for news or headline news. I would like more news highlights. When I ask for 80s music, Echo starts with the same 1 of 3 songs each time."
"Bought it as a gift, she loves it. Very entertaining and wonderful volume, having lots of fun with it."
Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.
Don't know how I managed without Alexa. Everyone in the family is enjoying her.
Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.
Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.
I have the Echo and bought this one for the bedroom. Great alarm clock.
I love Alexa! She has been a great addition! Would recommend her to anyone
"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great."
It's amazing! I love how loud it plays the music!!
Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets
Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.
"Purchased as a gift for my husband. He is not a tech person, I was afraid he would be intimidated but he loves it."
The tap is a great product! Access to Alexa in a grab and go format!
Great to use as a portable speaker to take around with you as you work outside as long as you have a wifi connection. I use it with Pandora and Amazon unlimited music.
I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.
I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.
"I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband."
It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station
Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.
I love its portability! The speakers are phenomenal!
"Love having the wireless tap to use anywhere. It's small, sound is good. charges up quickly. Bough the sling to protect it outside."
"It's not the echo but for what I paid, it's well worth every penny"
"I already had a tap upstairs but wanted another for downstairs. I love that I can pick it up off the charging cradle and take with me anywhere, like to the shower, kitchen, laundry room, back yard, or anywhere within wifi range and never miss anything I'm listening to: music, podcast, news, audio book etc."
"Great Amazon tap, you can take Alexa anywhere. Love it, can do the big Alexa can do and more! No know issue safer..."
"Love the Dot, Hate the Tap Portable! This device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though."
Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that'
"Great speaker, Love using voice commands, Even my granddaughters use the voice command to search for songs."
Really like the Wi Fi & being able to take it to any room in the house. My music sounds great. Love all the features.
"The whole family is using it. Music, Bluetooth speaker, questions, game times, sports scores. Love the portability."
This is awesome addition to the stationary Echo. I can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside. Great sound and long battery
I love this .. Great extra for my amazon echo .. Does everything it does but it's cordless .. Keeps charge for many days .. Push button to activate .. Wireless speaker also out of wifi .. Really cool !!
"In my search for a wireless speaker, I looked at various models and decided on this one because of the portability, the look and how it synced with Alexa. I have an Alexa and this product was spot on! The sound is great! I use it in the balcony and stream all music from pandora, different stations and the quality is great!! Definitely would recommend!"
So glad I purchased this productive it use it all the time
"Purchased this as a gift for a teenage kid as a graduation present. Very pleased with the purchase. The kids love it. Small size, but good speakers. Perfect for the college dorms where he is scheduled to go in a couple of months. Love how the device connects to the cloud and keeps itself updated."
Love that you can take this anywhere and hook up to my Bluetooth. Great sound quality.
This is a great piece of hardware...I love it. really good all around..
"What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office."
It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends
"Smart, timely, very effective around the house. I have a Dot as well but the Tap has MUCH better sound. I had a Google Earth and replaced it with the TAP because Google was not as smart as Tappy!"
There's a lot of features and we are just getting started with Tap. Glad we made the purchase!
Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.
This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.
It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.
"The Amazon Tap is outstanding. There have been more applications slowly becoming avaliable. It is simple to use. It works with our Nest, which is a nice application."
He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs
"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family."
What a terrific device. You can ask it anything and she has an answer. It's small enough to place anywhere so it doesn't look instructive
"I have missed my Pandora since I moved from Ft. Worth, TX to Colorado a few months ago. My nephew had the Amazon Tap and I was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it ( saying.. ALEXA.. tell MIMI (their Grandmother) to GO TO BED.. AND IT DID!! And the sound and quality of music coming from it. Awesome. :) I had to have one, so I went to local Best Buy and bought it. I even set it up myself (I'm 65 so was impressed with myself! LOL) but I have listened nonstop to 60s music or music from DIRTY DANCING (which I loved). I have ordered a little case from Amazon.com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room, which I have been doing. I feel like I have a new found friend.... love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as BOSE in my book! Get it, you'll love it! I DO!! :) VERY VERY pleased with it! Weather updates here or where my kdis are. Just checking. :)No interruptions or commercials when listening ALL DAY LONG!"
"I love it hut I think I should have got the bigger one, but its entertaining"
We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.
Gift for my wife to listen to her music when she's sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out.
This gizmo is awesome for those who want the portability and cool things you can do with the Alexa world!
It's a nice item but really there's other things that do the same thing. So we actually returned it.
"Must have for people who have an Amazon Prime account and an Echo. Portability and water resistant. Works great by the hot tub or pool, and let's you access the normal Alexis capabilities."
I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!
"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo."
I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.
Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.
"..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode."
I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.
"The tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size. I also have an Amazon Dot, but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the Tap to enjoy the better sound. It's worth it."
Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.
Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up
"easy to use , sound is great, i use it any where in the house"
"Have Amazon echo, dot and now the tap. All work very well, and.the tap sounds great."
Lets me choose the type of music I love. Can even go to the beach with me using my sling.
"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement."
"Love the Tap! Bought it as a gift and love the sound quality. For such a small speaker, it packs a big punch!"
"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button."
"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear"
"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good."
Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..
"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing."
"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good."
Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.
"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen."
"Like DOS, you need to memorize your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Assistant is smarter. Also you cant use Spotify free account, to work around you must add a lot of free music to Amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music. Google home is more convenient this case, as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from Spotify. If you have paid account for Spotify then not much different here. But to do searching you may be disappointed with this Tap, Google Home is just much smarter. The sound of this Tap is very good indeed, but I return it because it cant do music alarm, also it cant use Spotify for free, also its search is not smart enough, so I switched to Google Home."
"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype."
You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.
"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it."
"I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!"
"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out."
"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!"
We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.
"If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable."
"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting"
Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product
I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.
just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.
You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.
Incredible range. Clear sound. We bought the sleeve and hung it in the backyard for a party. Amazing 360 clear sound.
"I bought this to listen to music. I do not use the Alexa feature all that much. The feature does work great, but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak. The speakers work great. I can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it. Bass is decent. I would recommend to someone."
We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.
"Anyone needing a compact and easily mobile speaker should look at this. The sound quality is excellent, it is easy to sync via Bluetooth and gives you the ability to stream music when connected to wifi. Great product for the price and perfect for the office."
Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions
"Bought the Tap for my mom to primarily listen to music. Although my mom forgets ""the girl's name"" haha, we've found Alexa will answer without saying her name. The rechargeable base is nice so the Tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi. Sound is great, too! Pleased!"
"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it."
I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it.
"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music."
It's nice and portable and works well on the go. Wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button.
"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!"
I like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice. You can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say Alexa.
"The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go."
"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!"
"The Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. It has a hands free option, it works well both as a way to take Alexa on the road and as your primary Alexa device at home., the Tap doesn't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers in its price range. It's not waterproof and Alexa doesn't work at all without Wi-Fi. but still pretty cool and heaper than the Echo."
"Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use."
"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing."
"It takes me a few tries to figure out how to connect to internet and then change it to blue tooth when needed. Overall , once it's set up it's super easy to use. Works best if you have Spotify premium. Voice recognition is good and it improves over time. Sound quality is good. Battery is really good."
"I had trouble linking to my Joule Cooking App, finally got on the third day. I Love it now, still is learning Voice Recognition though"
"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously."
It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.
"Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can."
"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose."
Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there 70s
Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.
i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.
I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!
Having fun exploring the capabilities. The sound quality is great!
I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.
This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!
"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well."
we're early in the stages of home smartness but this is a good start
I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.
"Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to."
"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows"
Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality
It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it
Love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music
Bought as a family gift. We use it all the time now. Very helpful and covenient
"Works great, sound is clear and is really loud. Would recommend"
"The Tap is a fun way to be able to bring Alexa around your home. Where ever you are, you can get access to all of the information, music, news, radio and more!"
Great for travel. It is very loud for its size. Over all I love it.
"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!"
It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.
Tap is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands‚Ä¶you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit."

"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot."
"It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more"
Once the tap was able to be activated by voice I started to have some interest. Having said that I notice I do use the 'Tap' button when I have it in my hand. We use it mostly outside and by our hot tub. Took is on vacation this last week and use it at the beach using cell phone as an access point.
It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.
"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-"
Tap makes a great mobile Alexa device. Not as loud as Echo but still louder than the Dot. Voice enabled Alexa works but doesn't detect voice as easy as the Echo or Dot. As a mobile Bluetooth speaker though it works fine.
I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing
"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79"
The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.
"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money."
I bought this as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it!!
"Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist....."
The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.
"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite."
"I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music."
"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!"
"I like its flexibility, portability and it is the best value option of all three Alexas"
I have the Echo and I just love it... I bought the Tap for my daughter for Christmas so she does not know she has it yet.
"I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do"
Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.
"I have the Amazon dot, which is great. But after purchasing the tap, which was on sale too, I was sold. You can take it any where. And the sound is great!!!"
"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift."
"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works."
This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!
I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn‚Äôt appreciate.
"I bought one on Prime day for about 50 shipped and fell in love with it and wanted another one and found this on eBay. I have a Sonos with Alexa, which sounds amazing, but needs to be plugged in. This is a great, inexpensive, portable, AC/DC, great sounding Alexa speaker. I don't understand why it isn't more popular, given the 10 hr battery and all the features. easy to pair bluetooth, easy wifi setup, the Alexa app makes things simple."
Alexa works great. It was easy to set-up and to us. My wife uses it for playing music through her iPhone and is very happy with it. I am always finding and learning new things with Alexa.
purchased as a gift but I do have the Echo. If the echo works like the Echo it will be great.
I haven't figured it out yet. So far it seems ok but I haven't used all of its potential yet.
Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.
"I love my Amazon Tap. I was in the market for a portable speaker and I saw these one on sale so I decided to pick it up. I only wanted it for a Bluetooth speaker, but Alexa is amazing I use it everyday. Alexa was a huge plus."
"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a ""beat box"" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a ""beat box"" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well."
"Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa..... The Tap sits next to my bed on the nite stand where I can easily call up ijnfo from my bed or as I walk by during the day or nite. Especially useful for a review of my calendar so I can review my upcoming days plans. Try Alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house!"
"It's very easy to connect devices, and it produces a good sound. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound. AI app Alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches. Overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool,"
This is so easy to operate and fun too! I love it!!
The speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable. I can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in.
"I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself."
Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift
Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .
"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats"
"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it."
"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time."
This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.
This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it
This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality
I have a few top end Bluetooth speakers and this Amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in
"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size."
"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!"
It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.
Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.
"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time."
Great sound. Love it. It's value is well worth it.
When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.
Happy to have purchased this one for my birthday and this is the best
Good product but requires hands on to operate. Good if sitting close but not if you're mobile. Wold be great if portable and hands free. Returned it and ordered the Dot.
I like buying things that work as advertised. This does.Although it does not respond as well to my wife's commands. Hmmm...
The only thing we don't like is that it had to stay plugged in to work.
"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc."
"Small, portable works as a blue tooth speaker when I take it away from home with me."
"Tap is a portable Amazon Echo with speakers. Great for carrying to basement or upstairs. Works like echo but not voice activated, you must ""tap"" it before talking."
Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.
"Love, love, love this! Can't wait to use it on our deck this summer!"
"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming"
Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.
Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!
If you have Prime this is the best thing you can buy!
"Good sound but unlike Echo, you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do. I ordered a Dot so this may solve that issue."
Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.
"I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Dot. The Echo Tap is the best of both and Portable. I have echos in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the patio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Alexa and wifi. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Alexa now more than she talks to me."
Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the Alexa feature I listen to Kindle books that are not available as audio books
"thought rice was a little high but now that i have one, it is worth every penny. have not had any problems with it and not bothered by not having a backlight"
"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last."
This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.
"I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time."
My nephew is going to high school and the kindle is a great gift for him. Bestbuy has good selection and the price is good too!
Kindle just keeps getting better. This device is the perfect size to pack away for a business trip to kill some time reading a book or even uploading your documents to access them quickly.
Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.
"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
I'm an avid reader. The Kindle is my go to for ease. It fits in my purse or knitting bag and stays charged for days.
I love the Amazon Kindles! They are a reasonable price for a great little tablet.
"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com."
Nice alternative for reading kindle books for kids. Not many features but good enough for reading.
"This was advertised as the latest version 8. My ignorance led me to its 79 price. I thought they were all Paperwite - as in just like white paper in a book. Bought it for my wife. I returned mine as a refused shipment and ordered the PaperWhite. It has a backlight, higher resolution, and for 20, worth it. Kindler 1"
"I bought this because it was 30.00 off for the early Black Friday sale and it doesn't need to be charged every day like my fire tablet. (Which is very annoying to have to stop reading because the battery is dying). This stays charged for days! This works great during the day and I bought a Energizer book light for 6.99 that clicks on it. The book light works just fine for night reading. Only con is the magazines I downloaded are not in color which I miss,so I will use for books only. I like the size and I able to carry it in my purse and read as I commute."
I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.
I bought some to my friend as gifts.The product are all very good.
"Very light and easy to read on. Could have more pixles like the Paperwhite, but looks still pretty much like a book. Battery lasts forever, but without a sale its a little bit overpriced."
"This is a good length cable for those that don't want tight connections because a cable is too short. I alternate back and forth between using two printers so having a longer cable allows me to keep two printers near the computer.Setup worked flawlessly, it hooked up easily and the computer recognized the usb connection. I was set to print and have been enjoying this cable ever since.Final thoughts, the best length of the cable really depends on your setup situation but a longer one like this gives you more flexibility of where you want your attached device."
"I found this wire to be of good quality. It performed as well as any other USB 3.0 cable and, to the extent that you would prefer something 'in black', this is the one to go. Amazon sells them in several lengths so you just get the right size.Of course, this is a generic USB 3.0 cable but it's nice that the connectors are or appear to be gold-plated. And, of course, it's an AmazonBasics which means that price is very much 'right' and you can always rely on Amazon's quick and efficient customer service and support."
"I am using the 3' version of this cable and it works great. It work well with my external Seagate 3.0 drive. I just connected it and it worked flawlessly. The cable is sturdy and is gold plated for better connectivity (I assume that helps. There is no real way to test that at home).The cables are priced similarly to competitors. The nice thing about it being an Amazon product is that I am sure the return policy would be simple and quick. One word of caution is make sure both devices you are connecting are USB 3.0. The A side will fit in a 2.0 socket, but the B side will not. Check your devices documentation. It does no good to use this cable if both devices are not USB 3.0. You will create a bottleneck at the 2.0 side.Otherwise, this is a great little cable and you can't go wrong with it."
"The cable works without any issues. The connectors at both end are gold plated, and the cable is 9 feet long. The cable is shielded as in the picture, it's a plain cover. As in the picture, one side is the rectangle-shaped connector (which connects to your PC), and the other end is the new USB 3.0 stack connector (which connects to your device). Make sure your device has this connector. I have been using AmazonBasics cables for almost everything, HDMI, optical audio, USB, and they are all reliable. No issues with any of the twenty AmazonBasics cables I own."
I have several AmazonBasics cables now and they've all been great. This particular AmazonBasics USB 3.0 cable is 9 feet long and delivers full bandwidth between my Mac and my external hard drive.Build quality is very good and the connectors are gold-plated to ensure data contact. AmazonBasics is well worth considering when shopping for cables.
"I built my last home PC and used a motherboard with native USB 3.0 connectors. I've used this cable between a USB 3.0 hub and my computer's USB 3.0 ports. This cable features solid construction and good shielding. The connections work well, and the cable upholds USB 3.0 data throughput speeds to the flash drives and portable USB 3.0 hard drives I've plugged into the hub. In all, a solid value."
"Sturdy, lightweight, tops lifts for easy access to pet , easy to lean and not bulky. Carrier will easily fit on your lap in the car. A+"
Is Amazon kidding me They want me to pay 19.99 for an item that is a critical part of the functioning of their product Outrageous. I will find another 5V charger.
I bought this thinking that I needed it but I didnt so it was a waste of money. I do so hate to waste money. the Kindle can hook to a regular cell phone charger and it comes with a cable that connects to the computer. For some reason I thought I just had to have this too when I bought my Kindle.
"One star because this should've been included when I purchased my Kindles. Bought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy camper. We need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I'll purchase). Just give us that option. Fires don't work for just straight up reading (can't read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off. I don't care about the cloud. I need books downloaded to my devices. We vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wifi, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much. Thousands of books. 5,000+ in my library at home before a stroke forced me to Kindle and now thousands more. Include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity."
"No reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended."
As advised. Came really fast
as described.
great wires.
Great feel and seems to be very well made
Good quality
I bought it for my grandson‚Äôs birthday... he loves it;)
This was a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves this thing
We have one in every room and it's nice that we can ask to play music in all the devices. She has a hard time understanding Spanish words and sometimes we've noticed that she replies from other rooms (not the one we are in). Overall a good buy to help you at home or office
I bought this so i can save all of my books. It was a bit small at first but you get used to it. Overall i am very satistfy
I bought this as a gift. I think it is pretty decent both quality and design.
"This is a great e-reader, perhaps a little pricey but well worth the money. It is extremely light and the e-ink is very readable."
"I have owned several Kindles over the years, and this one is the best yet. The contrast and clarity is improved over the already-good Paperwhite 2. I like the page turn ""buttons"" on the bezel as well."
"Nothing will replace the joy of flipping through the pages of a book, but living in a studio apartment with my girlfriend, I simply don't have the space for all the books I'd like to own on top of the ones I have now.I got this for my girlfriend because she has difficulty reading on my iPad Air. She has no difficulty using her Kindle Voyage, and she thoroughly enjoys it.I'm actually thinking of getting one for myself farther down the line."
"Light weight, easy to use, love the lighted background. I am unable to make it stay on page count it keeps going back to hours left to read. But other then that a great ereader."
"The Amazon Kindle Voyage is the absolute e-reader to end all e-readers. Light, amazing screen, and stylish, minimal design. If you want an e-reader, definitely buy this one!"
I have been very pleased with my Voyage. It operates as advertised and has been a pleasure to use. Very well pleased with battery life.
We had previously owned Kindle paperwhite version 1 and this is a substantial improvement. The new screen is much brighter and the response is quicker .
"Absolutely love this new Kindle! Light, sharp, glass touchscreen and adaptive front light. Very easy to use and read!"
"I have the second generation Kindle Paperwhite and the new Voyage is far superior to it. The resolution is much sharper, the back light is much brighter and the power button location is much more convenient. I highly recommend it."
"I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit."
"I bought this product back in September and have loved every moment of it. Setup was easy, the Amazon store and search bar make it easy to narrow down the thousands of books available, and the battery is long-lasting so that I don't have to worry about constantly charging. In 3 months I have only had to charge it twice. Best parts are the backlit screen with easy adjustment and ample storage!"
love this device it is amazing. the screen is bright and easy to read
This is my third Amazon Kindle and by far it is the best one. The adaptive lighting really helps as it is easy on the eyes. The battery lasts for weeks on a normal charge and charges to full pretty fast.I still enjoy the eink displays over a regular phone or tablet for extended reading periods.The kindle voyage is light weight and I was able to easily find cases and accessories online.I highly recommend the kindle voyage over the other kindle readers because of the advanced features.
"Went to buy the Kindle Paperwhite, but after comparing them side-by-side I decided to buy the Voyage. I thought that the print was a little sharper and I liked the smaller and lighter weight. I have been using it almost every day and really, really enjoy it."
"I extremely enjoy and like my Kindle Voyage Reader a whole bunch! I like reading on it a whole bunch, especially my Living Bible, because I'm a Christian that loves God and Jesus Christ of Nazareth! I believe this product is a very excellent reader, which a person can read all of their books on the Kindle Voyages in their Amazon library! Definitely get one today, because especially, because it is light weight and has an awesome back light for reading in the dark. I like it because it is so light and easy on the arms while holding while reading. God bless you! :)"
"My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working."
Fantastic for reading in dark conditions. Very light and easy to hold.
"The Kindle voyage is an improvement on the paper white. It is lightweight, compact, and easy to use."
"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand."
"This is the 3rd Kindle we have purchased and they keep getting a little nicer with each version. The light on this one is a really nice feature. The battery life is better, the page turning options are better, it is lighter... there are just a lot of nice little improvements. If you like to read in an electronic format I cannot imagine disliking the Kindle."
"Purchased as a gift. It was a good choice. It is as advertised,"
As expected. i would suggest to get a cover. The dictionary is very easy to use.
I like that it has an Automatic backlight adjustment
Great device. Great for reading books. Small and compact. Lightweight. Looks great too. The light is a great feature
Great product. Would recommend it to others to buy.
This is the best Kindle I have ever used. This is way better than the Kindle Fire HD which I also own.
Love it! Best e reader I have owned so far and I've owned quite a few
I'm not one for reviewing usually but my oh my do i love this thing. It is lightweight and amazing!! I LOVE HOW CRISP IT IS AND HOW BRIGHT IT IS.
The Voyage is a great reader for those like myself who love to read books. The lines and images are crisp and clean. Its light weight even with the cover. The only thing is the origami cover was something that i would have thought of designing differently. It feels uncomfortable to hold... The device though is awesome and the page turn features are great you can use either side to turn pages. Would suggest to anyone who loves to read!!
Love this ereader; very convenient. Very easy to use.
The best kindle that I ever had!It is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book.Great for indoor and outdoor reading
"I have always enjoyed reading. I read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series. This product has already saved me at least $80, and i've only had it for a month. Yes I did the math! I love this thing!"
Really like to read ebooks on the Kindle. The contrast is perfect so there is no strain on the eyes. The smooth feel gives a good user experience.
I love this kindle. Faster than the paper white in how it responds to changing pages and/or books. The self adjusting light levels works very good in mine. Having the option on the frame to change pages is great but you have to press a little hard on the forward page button or it will do a backward change instead; this is the only reason why I don't give it a 5.I love this reader
"Voyager is super easy to use and see, love the translations too!"
i'm an avid reader and love the Kindle Voyage. i love the adjustable fonts and that it automatically adjust to the light settings. The push sides to flip pages but not if you accidentally bump the wrong side which has happened a few times. Great battery life it's usually a couple of days before i have to recharge.
"I love my kindle voyage. It is very little weight and I love the page press that it has, don't even have to move your hand to turn the page. You can read it in the bright sun and in the dark which no over brand of tablets you can do that with."
"I accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the Voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither Best Buy nor Amazon would do anything to help. Well, Amazon offered $15 off purchasing the Paperwhite and that wasn't something I wanted at all. Now I'm stuck with a $199 broken Voyage. Not a happy customer. I realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business."
"Nice ereader for reading books. Browser should be improved otherwise fine for reading books, another irritating part is ads pop up which amazon shud fix"
Very nice display and high resolution! A pleasure to read.
This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.
Kindle voyage is the costliest of the kindle range but its worth it due to light weight and adaptive backlight. Enjoying it so far.
Lighter than a helium balloon. So thin. Bright white screen. Crisp letters. Intuitive. Easy touchscreen page turning (or a gentle squeeze on either side of the book) and easy menu access. Ideal size. I don't know how they can improve this further. Just ordered their (Kindle's) Origami cover too.
Gave up my tablet for the voyage and haven't looked back. A pleasure to read on.
I am so glad i procrastinated in buying an e-reader.I was going to get the kindle paperwhite- then the Voyage came out- I bought it and am so happy with it- a joy to use.
"I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version"
Improved interface and same great readability as the Paperwhite.
Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it.
"Even better than the Paperwhite, which have used regularly over the past couple of years."
I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.
"There is no better E-reader available today. It costs a bit more, but the build quality is the best."
"I have had several Kindle ereaders over the years also Nook, Kobo, and Sony as well, I even had the original Rocket Reader (I still have it) and they have all improved over the years so it's not surprising that the new Voyage is the best one yet. Over all I prefer the Kindle readers now and Amazon has perfected the eBook experience so why go anywhere else."
I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn't go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons.
"This kindle is so good on so many levels. Not sure it is worth the price premium over the paperwhite, but you will definitely have the best reader on the market."
What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.
"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader."
I choose store pick Up in New York and works Great. Love my Kindle Voyage
I have owned several Kindles and this is the best one yet
This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.
"Works well from outdoors, to plane to reading in bed. No issues. Excellent all around. Better than a light."
received earlier than expected and was very happy. Will continue to buy at Best Buy in the future
"I purchased this specifically to take on a cruise. It exceeded my expectations. The voyager is slim, even with the cover, it is light weight and the screen is very clear. Battery life is good. I would absolutely recommend it."
"Having had an original Kindle which I have enjoyed for several years, I decided to upgrade to the newest Kindle Voyage. I love the touch screen functionality and the lighted reading. I only wish I had done it sooner."
"Having owned each of the previous Kindle readers, this one is without a doubt the best of the bunch. I highly recommend that the serious reader consider this device. Do note that this is a Reader, not a tablet. Grab an iPad or Kindle Fire for your tablet needs but get this to read books. The high dot-per-inch count makes it easy on the eyes, as does the evenly-distributed light. Superb device!"
I've started to allow this device to grow on me. Yes I saw some color variation but either my eyes have adjusted or it's gone away. I'm back to reading like I used to and love it!
"I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly."
"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers."
Nightlight allows me to read at night when the wife is sleeping
"The Voyage is easily the best kindle avaiailable. The page turn buttons are a little wonky a times, but I find the high-res screen worth it."
"This is my third Kindle and the best one yet. Love the new controls, the backlit page, the compact size and the ease of use. I would recommend the Kindle Voyage to all readers!"
This is the best kindle yet. Very sharp text and easy page management.
"Upgraded from a paperwhite and the build quality of this unit is much, much better! Just it's kind of expensive for an e-reader."
"This is my third Kindle, plus I have used the Kindle app on my two iPads and three iPhones. I always want to have a real Kindle so I will read in peace and avoid distraction from email, texts and such.This is much more readable that all of the previous models. The resolution is as good as I could ever want. The lighting is perfectly even and makes reading in any light (or lack of) completely comfortable. The screen response is almost perfect, but I am just getting use to the new side areas to turn pages. I love the weight and can read in any position, including on my back in bed, with one hand.I am perfectly fine with paying $200 for this Kindle. If you want something to read your books, and nothing else, this is the product for you."
"I first bought the Kindle Paperwhite with the 300dpi screen, I didn't think the jump to the Voyage was worth the $80 plus additional taxes. I read about the Voyage and with Georgia having the back to school tax free days and the e-readers qualifying I returned the Paperwhite and purchased this one. Boy am I glad I did."
"The Amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader. Prior to owning this tablet, I had a couple of PW2's which are great tablets in their own right. My wife knew that I had my eye on the Kindle Voyage but I was waiting to catch it during one of Amazon's rare sales events. Unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for Father's Day and I planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after comparing it to my PW2 side by side, I decided I couldn't wait for it to get cheaper and so I kept it. The PW2 is a great ereader (ended up giving it to my oldest son) but the Voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter. It's also a couple of ounces lighter and slimmer. Is it worth the upgrade? Definitely, if you can get it on sale (usually $150). At $199? Well, that's up to you. Obviously I paid full freight and I don't regret it.....much. :) With that being said, the PW3 is worth a look too. Same 300 ppi clarity but usually $80 to $100 cheaper. The Voyage has a bezel that's flush with it's glass so it's not the ""crumb catcher"" paperwhite is but hey, maybe you want to skip eating while you're reading and save the dough!"
Great day reading. The backlight works great in the day as well. It is nice to have enough light to read wherever you are. The batterry life is also long
"I have owned exactlo, nooks, kobo's and kindles. This is the Cadillac of readers!!!"
"This is the very best devise to read from. The print is one hundred percent book like. The device is light, elegant and a pleasure to use. There is nothing that comes close."
"What could be better than a book? A Kindle Voyage! This wonderful device is easier to carry around than a book. Whenever I need to wait a few minutes, I whip out my Kindle. It is clear, it works for a long time without recharging, and it receives new books instantly. I had been using an Ipod with audio books for a long time but I got tired of the difficulty in searching for material. It also lost my place unless I was extremely careful. This device is lightweight and slips easily into my handbag or pocket. I also bought the Origami case - with it, the Kindle comes on automatically when it is opened. A great and useful device - I love it!"
"The extra money for the Voyage version is well worth it, as the screen is brighter, clearer, and easier on the eyes. The other specs are also nicer compared to other Kindle versions, but the screen is what sold me."
"It is better than in thought it was. At first I didnt like how small the screen was, but then the conistent reading, it got much better. After a month i it grew on me."
"If you're planning on reading at nighttime or with dimmed lights, I recommend going with Voyage, because PaperWhite has some blue hot spots of light on the bottom of the screen. This one doesn't. Really awesome device, same as PaperWhite for reading in sunlight. My honest opinion, even better than an actual book in your hand.Sometimes it feels like the refresh rate is slow, but you can get used to it. This is not the same LCD screen as you're used to.Very easy to set up, but you definitely need an Amazon account."
"The voyage is lighter, and thinner than the paperwhite. I love it!"
Bought this for my wife who loves books. She was always agents ebooks but now she can't be without it.
"I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own."
When you compare the Kindle Voyage 6's Screen to the other model. The Screen was brighter for reading
I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.
i cant at night it has no back light from one to ten its a 7
This Kindle is really light weight and has an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically. Very comfortable to hold and read. I like that it has page advance buttons on both sides including the touch screen finger swipe to advance.
"Reading on my commute, or in a waiting room, is a pleasant way to pass time - and convenient"
Great way to read books. The screen is readable in any light. Add a waterproof case and you have the perfect beach or pol side library!
"turning pages not as easy as the original ones; whole Home Page experience not really user friendly, and seems geared to just sell you more books."
This is my very first kindle. I am enjoying reading more books. The size is quite comfortable as well as the weight. The battery life is quite good. If you're looking for a new way to read book this is definitely the one.
This was actually for my daughter and she has rarely put it down since she got it.
"After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either. I do like this more than my last Kindle, so that is all that really matters."
Product was as described and delivered on time as scheduled.
"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-("
I will start off with the fact that I like paper books a lot. I bought the e reader because it's light and can travel with multiple books. The interface is fairly easy to use and it holds a lot of books. The automatic light feature doesn't work as nicely as I would. Overall I am happy with the purchase but there are features that could make it a 5.
The voyage is so much easier on the eyes. The size is great and easy to carry in a briefcase for travel purposes.
"I like everything about the Voyage reader. It has a crisp display, is small and lightweight. I give it four stars instead of five because the screen light takes sometimes a while to adjust. The battery life is amazing. Prize could be a little less."
"Easy to carry; easy to read. Easy to get books and download. Nice to have a dictionary within your book. Able to download books, newspapers or magazines."
"I love how easy the Kindle is to operate. It is very intuitive, and requires only a short learning curve. Also it is one of the most economical ways to read books."
Easy to read screen in a small light package. Excellent battery life and even fits into my work pockets.
Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.
Bought this for vacations at the beach - easy to read in the sulight.
"Out of the box there really is nothing to do but plug it in to the USB drive and you're ready to go. You get a pop up reminder asking if you want to use the drive as a back up. If you select yes or no that will be the last time you see it. If you say ""decide later"" it will come up each time you plug it in to the USB drive."
Easy to use and easy to order books. Now I just have to join amazon prime for the lending library and look into the books i haven't read but want to.
"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!"
It makes reading at night much easier. Easy access to books that are of interest.
E-Reader battery doesn't hold up as long as stated.
"I bought one for my Dad, liked it so much I bought one for myself. Even better than the paperwhite."
"Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions."
"The Kindle was as a replacement for an earlier model. Its performance and ease of use are superb However, the battery life is far shorter than my older version. It wouldn't last from LA to Frankfort and the old one did."
"I am a big fan of e-readers. I prefer the e-ink screens over tablet screen when reading books. I decided to pick up the new Kindle Voyage. Here are my thoughts.First, the Kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the Paperwhite model. It's very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired.Secondly, the addition of the page turn buttons is a welcomed addition. The buttons make it so easy to hold the Kindle with one hand and turn pages.Lastly the screen. I marked off a star because I had to return my first Voyage directly to Amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. The replacement Kindle Voyage that I received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. That being said, Amazon needs to really focus on quality control because I've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. If you're spending $200 for an e-reader, then the screen should be perfect. Especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the e-readers.If you're an avid reader, then the Kindle Voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make. If you're a casual reader who has a Paperwhite, you're probably okay with what you have."
"I purchased this Kindle because I wanted the buttons on the side -- I prefer to hold my e-reader in just my left hand and it's hard to turn pages by screen press only. I love this so far! It's an upgrade from my Nook because it's so much easier to borrow books from the library! I've never used a Paperwhite so I can't speak as to how it's better, other than it has the side-press buttons (which was worth it to me)."
Couldn't be happier with this latest Kindle e-reader! Love being able to turn pages by pushing a button and the bright uniform lighting! It's a big step up from my first generation paperweight!
"Lightweight, bright screen, adequate capacity, great battery life. The perfect stand alone eReader."
Perhaps the best ereader made until now. Fantastic reading experience.
Reading on the voyage is such a pleasure. Its so much more convenient than carrying around an actual book. I love that I can read in bed without disturbing my partner. The backlight makes reading a pleasure whether in the dark or outside in the sun. Truly well worth the price if you are a serious reader. I love having several books available so I never run out of reading material while at the doctors or on a plane......
"This is my second Kindle Voyage. I dropped the first one and broke the glass screen, so I bought a new one. I highly recommend the Voyage but also recommend buying a good protective cover and an extended warranty. ;-)"
Hands down this is the best ereader that you can buy...
"The voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. It's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. However the auto-adjust backlight feature & minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. This version includes the vocabulary builder, which I find myself using a lot nowadays. However, I'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. That's the one I actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. I thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. So that's why I'm confused on the price difference. The overall feel of it is fine. Not a lot thinner than the original. I keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle I have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. Oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because I thought it was broken but I just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine... other than those very minor complaints,I love it. I find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!"
As usual Amazon does it again. Fabulous ereader. Love the auto adjustment of the on board light!
I thoroughly enjoy the product it is really great and the best ever build by any company.
"This is third Kindle product and the size, battery life and readability have improved with each new generation. Very happy with product and will continue to purchase in the future as new versions become available."
Much better resolution than previous version and easier to use!
This was on my wife's Christmas list. She loves it. Easy to use.
Everything about it is outstanding except the price!
The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability.
"We got this for my wife to take with her when travelling. Although she still prefers printed books, she really likes this reader and it lightens her suitcase considerably. Excellent battery life and a good screen."
"Bought the original paper white and loved it. Even though there is not a tremendous difference between the two units, I have found that it is lighter and adjusts to light much better. Is it really worth the price difference is questionable. I would recommend this product to any avid reader."
"I am a gadget guy and a big fan of tablets and e-ink readers. They each have their specialties and purposes, and e-readers are still best for reading. I have bitten a kindle supporter from the beginning, this latest model only further improves on that reputation.The back lighting is awesome and the touch screen is amazing. The clarity and definition is outstanding. I was do excited waiting for this to be released and was very pleased with the results!"
"I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display, it's ""behind the counter"". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie."
The light from the page does not but a strain on your eyes when reading. I like how light it is to hold.
"The auto light adjust has worked great for me and I love the different options for page turning. Also, the smaller size and lighter weight is noticeable. If you are buying your first Kindle, I would recommend this. If you already have the Paperwhite, it's up to you but I've been happy I upgraded."
"Having had several models of Kindle readers, I can say that this is the best yet and is definitely worth the extra cost."
"I can hold this next to my Kindle Paperwhite and see that is brighter, more evenly lit, sharper and faster. But $200 is pushing the price a little high. If a friend wasn't looking to buy my old one, not sure I would have paid that much."
"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly."
"The newest Kindle eReader (Voyage) is a very good upgrade over the current model. It has several new hardware & coming software enhancements over the current model. However, unless you do an extreme amount of reading, I would not recommend upgrading if you owned the current PaperWhite generation. The high price does not justify it."
Got this for my pre teen who took to it like a duck to water. It is great size and easy to pack
If you are in doubt about spending the extra money to buy the Voyage... don't be. If it hadn't been a gift I would have most like not spent the money but after using it I am so glad I have this one.
"While generally a minor upgrade from the paperwhite, it's just the best e-reader on the market. X-ray seemed unnecessary until I was reading game of thrones and forgot who certain people were. The choice to swipe or pinch to change pages is nice too. It's a great device though if you're on a budget you would do fine with the last version."
Fantastic E-Reader. Battery lasts a few weeks on a single charge (if you leave wifi turned off). Feels great in your hands. Is very lightweight.
This E-reader makes reading ebooks very easy on the eyes and provides for a beautiful experience. The product feels like quality but gathers finger print marks on the back quickly if it doesn't have a case. Overall the e-reading experience is excellent though as the lighting and colors come across very pleasantly.
"Love the back light, fast response to changing pages. The kindle voyage is lite."
Best e reader yet ! The new voyage is much better then the first Paperwhite which was great !
My wife won't put this thing down! She's an elder with poor vision but manages to read this.
This is my favorite kindle so far. The size is perfect and the weight is minimal. I love the fact it is back lit and I don't need a book light.
"Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space"
"This kindle is a great buy, pretty simple to use, very convenient."
"I also have a Nook Glow but I miss having buttons. The ""squeeze the edge"" for a page turn is what sold me."
"What a fun toy this is! It was easy to learn to use, and If I needed help, the online User's Guide is right there. Purchasing books couldn't be easier, and there's no ""hard copy"" to dispose of when you'e done. I was able to check out a book from the public library with little effort. With so many low-cost or no-cost books, as well as current best sellers, there's an endless number to choose from. You can use the search function to search by topic or title. I like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that. I know I will enjoy my Kindle Voyage for a long time."
"Neighbor has one, and just loves it. So I bought one."
"Got this for a relative, and he really likes it. It was pricey for what it is though."
"Very good quality product. I bout as a gift for a friend, she loved it"
"I love to read books....paper and electronic (via my iPad), but had never owned a Kindle. When shopping at Best Buy, I mentioned to my husband that I might want to try a Kindle....went to another area and, when I returned, the Kindle VOYAGE was in our basket. OK so I though I would give it a try. I LOVE it! So compact, so easy to read my books and turn the pages without swiping or ??? I highly recommend the VOYAGE to existing and pending Kindle readers. So many great features in such a small package!"
"As a nook user, I had to make a change, so I tried the kindle. It is good."
"I had the paperwhite, but this voyage is definitely better. The quality is better, screen is seamless with the edge, which makes it feel premium and delivers more comfortable reading experience. Lighter than the paperwhite, love the pressure sensors to change pages. Overall better experience reading experience than the paperwhite."
My wife has had several Amazon Fire tablets. They all have one major flaw. Visibility in direct sunlight. This product addresses that issue. The Paper White screen is perfect for the days at the pool
already toldpeople about fast pickup.the kindle is great as always.
This was a gift for my wife who loves to read. She has the Kindle Fire and enjoys it. Her wishes were to have a smaller lighter reader that is also good to ready outside. She found it with the Voyage.
Was a gift. The receiver really enjoys it and was an upgrade from her previous kindle
Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.
Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small
"Small and light weight, easy to read from in bright light conditions"
"Always preferable to other pads, when reading books"
Great gifts!! Very much enjoyed by my family members.
"Working efficiently, no complaints so far. Makes reading fun!"
"This is a gift for friend, and she loves that! She told me this device helped her with concentration when read."
"I purchased my Voyage yesterday. It looked like I scratched the screen today and I contacted Amazon directly and they replaced my Voyage under the warentee I did not need to go thru bestbuy. Turns out it was food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is Amazon backs up their products! I do not think its worth 199$ for there is a weird screen discoloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting conditions BUT its barely noticeable. In normal light it looks quite normal. Due to cost it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite BUT in its defense the Voyage is much much lighter, thinner and more responsive and the page turn buttons are seamless. Over all this is a mighty nice product. Side note: I own a Nook glow-light plus which is cheaper and looks nicer and has a great feel to it as well. Nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the copperish color back and white textured front. The Voyage is attractive too BUT I think it will sell better if it had a "" two toned"" color Like maybe a white front and a colored back side. Voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same features. I just feel Amazon can afford to make their product more stylish. Also best buy does not seem to offer and real choices for cases on their kindles and tablets. I had to order a cover at ebay."
Great contrast and battery life with easy user interface.
"It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level."
"The Kindle Voyage is the first new model that I finally felt was good enough to replace my Kindle4NT (non-touch with side buttons). The original 4T and paperwhite models worked poorly for me, and lacked buttons. The pressure sensitive edges of the Voyage work great, and the touch screen functions work better in this model.Voyage is still at least $50 overpriced, but I ultimately worth the money if moving off an older button-style Kindle."
Very good screen for outdoors and nighttime use. Lightweight.
I love to read and using the Kindle has been great.
"The Kindle from Best Buy has made it easier for me to read. This is my first e-reader. I like the Voyage 6 for its brightness and speed, plus thelarge variety of reading material. I know Amazon is in the business ofmaking money by getting me to purchase Kindle books. However, I havefound several Kindle books available for free from my public library. I will, no doubt, buy some Kindle books elsewhere in the future. Best BuyHas been good to me. I did have a little problem finding someone in thestore who was well-informed on this product but finally got what I wanted."
Awesome thank goodness for the next week and we will have a good day
Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.
I wanted a simple reader for east of transportability and use. Although I still occasionally use my tablet to read I wanted something more light weight. I haven't tested this in the sunlight but so far I love it's smaller size and simplicity.
"The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage."
Easy to read in the sunlight. I really like that it adjusts to the lighting available making it easy to read anywhere.
Purchased this kindle for a friend and they absolutely enjoy it.
"Light, easy to read, large capacity and multiple ways to turn pages. What else can I say, it's a wonderful reader, especially in the Florida sunlight. Also, the iPhone app that sync your ready progress is great for times you have your phone but not the kindle."
"Best Reader ever. I've had a lot of Readers like Paper white 2013, Kindle DX, B&N nook and Kobo Aura HD before I get Kindle Voyage. But this one is really different.The only feature that I wish it'd support is memory slot! I guess Amazon will add it to the next generation of Kindles as well as Kindle Fires..."
"The reader is great, with a crisp display and excellent battery life. I like having the option of either using the buttons to flip pages, or just swipe it. The latter always required two hands, so the buttons can make it easier."
"Love the ability to read in sunlight, create files."
The Voyage is worth the extra money. It's a wonderful device. Very responsive and easy to use. I would highly recommend!
Bought this for easier reading and it meets my expectations. Great display fidelity.
Bought this as a Christmas gift. My daughter loves it. She specifically likes the screen lighting.
The quality of the display is amazing - the battery life is fantastic
"The text is sharp and paper like in well lit conditions. When using the backlight in dark conditions it becomes less paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on lights. Can set on automatic brightness level or manually set. Slim and lightweight when not using a case which I appreciate most about this kindle. Makes for easy holding and carrying/packing. Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. In fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. Im just someone who wants the best of the best so I bought 2 of these. One for my love as a gift, then I went and bought myself one. It was a well recieved gift and I aquired major browny points. We give them 4 thumbs up. We can read together in bed, in the woods, on the road or wherever we like. This is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go. I would give it 4.5 if that was an option."
No issues whatsoever. Works well! Best e reader there is!
It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.
"Light weight, great upgrades from the paperwhite. Love it!"
"Although the Price point is a bit high for what it is I love the new kindle. The screen is beautiful, the back light with auto-adjust dimming is great, and it feels very sturdy to hold. I am very glad that I upgraded form the nook but can only give 4 stars due to price."
"I like the small size and auto adjustable lighted screen. With my old Kindle I needed to have external light to read, but this one comes with the build one."
"I read often and love this e-reader. I previously had a nook and liked it, but it was old and did not have night reading option. The voyage is light and easy to hold. The backlighting is great at night. Overall very happy with this product for reading."
If you already have a Paperwhite then there is no need to upgrade. But if you are in the market this has an excellent display and quick page turns. The reason to buy a dedicated e-reader is the 3 week long battery life. Love it
"Small, light weight and battery lasts. I love this thing. Way better than lugging many paperback for long flights."
This e-reader fits very nicely into my library of other electronic devices. It works great.
"This is my second Kindle (the first one lasted several years). I enjoy the ability to read in the dark without background light. The backlight works very well and does not have the eye strain that a tablet may have. With the touch surface, I find it a little too sensitive and have accidentally moved several pages. The side page turn works very well. Much easier to travel with this unit than a large book."
"This is my second Kindle device. I enjoy using this to read in lower light conditions with the automatic adjustment. Touch screen is nice, but can accidentally move pagesif your fingers slip. No issues with readability in many light conditions."
"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. We have been using a Nook for the last 2 years (bought at Best Buy - got 2 and a great deal) Can't use Nook to read in sunlight. The Voyage is smaller, lighter and easier to use. Have not used it yet to read in sunlight. Wish it had some other features like - color display and sound. Waiting to see if I decide to get one until then I still am using a Nook. Very easy to download a book from public library. It is a tad expensive for what it does."
"The Kindle Voyager is the best E-reader you can buy! The resolution is absolutely amazing. The long lasting battery is, by far, the best feature."
"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day."
"This kindle has been great, I upgraded from an original kindle and haven't looked back.I think if you have one of the paperwhite's with the backlight you might not see enough bang for your buck to upgrade though."
Love it. Very happy with purchase. Does everything I expected .
"I like this reader.. It is easy to read in daylight with no glare. It has an auto backlight that works well in all lighting situations. I like the links to the dictionary, encyclopedia and internet links in the indigenous. This reader utilizes them all."
"Great ebook reader with ambient light, page press, and sharp text. It is thin and light."
The best ebook reader in the market. The text is crisp and I love the backlighting.
"Excellent device. Screen is impressive. Happy with this purchase, and looking forward to reading many books on it!"
Fabulous new functionality love the night reading capabilities
"My last kindle died right before Christmas. I was lost with no way to read my books. Went to Best Buy to look at all the different ones available. Found that the Voyage was the best for my situation. Being backlit was perfect for the many different places I read, car, work, restaurants, and planes."
"This is my third Kindle and by far the best. I know use this for 100% of all reading - including - and the reason I bought it, for reading in the pool. I still own 2 good tablets and a laptop. This does not compete with them. Absolutely outstanding outside in Dallas. This does not overheat, with absolutely zero glare. Yes I can read in the pool on a sunny day. I have about 300 books on this and don't charge it but once every other week. I use it 1-3 hours a day without fail. I wish the unit was truly water resistant and it's built in browser is almost worthless. This is an eReader and not a tablet."
very good e-reader. like the back light very much. very light for carrying around.
"I love my kindle voyage. I get distracted when I read on my tablet, so I decided to purchase an eReader. I am very happy I did! I hope to meet my reading challenge now!"
"This readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag. Easy to use, controls for children are very effective. Am glad I bought it."
"This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone!"
Love my new Kindle Voyage. I have an original Kindle but this one does so much more. Recommend it highly.
I bought this as a gift for my wife who loves reading. She has really enjoyed being able to. Andy this sleek reader in her purse when she's on the go.
I upgraded from an old kindle. It's really nice to have the backlight and slightly larger screen.
"I purchased one of these for myself back in January, and when my mother remarked on it, I knew she wanted one as well. It works great for both myself and her, despite the differences in our reading habits and hand sizes."
Great and easy read especially when outside in the sun.
This is an very good to use in all areas. The letters are very clear.
I was impressed with the voyage overall. I especially like the light sensor feature because it makes reading enjoyable in all settings.
This is a replacement machine. Good reading experience. Great for travel - and reading in bed.
"The Kindle Voyage 6 is better than the real thing. After wearing out a first generation Kindle in our home, we knew we wanted something with versatility of the original with a few added features. The background light is a big plus as it allows my wife to read at night without having to keep the lights on. It's a great ereader at the right price."
I wish it had 3G or 4G. Other than that it is great.
The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.
Bought two for gifts. A huge hit!! They are readers and love not having to lug books.
Purchased this over the holidays and have enjoyed it since. The look and feel of a book is great.
"This is just what my father wanted. It is portable, light weight and has an amazing backlight."
highly recommend this product to all book lovers...
I bought if for my husband for our travel. Much lighter then taking books or ipad with us. Took him a little time to figure out the device and how to borrow e-books from our local public library. But now he loves it.
"Super light, the paper white is a huge success and the battery life is as advertised. However, it is so light and small it mandates a protective case-BUT they are never in stock or otherwise available."
"A bit pricey, but worth the money in my opinion. Perfect size and great screen!"
I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.
"I never owned Kindle before. I tried to just be content with a PW 2, but after close comparison in store, I sticked to the Voyage. Luckily, I haven't been disappointed so far."
"My first Kindle, but the backlight feature is great"
"Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience."
Perfect reading light and long battery life. I really love it.
Purchased for my wife to replace her previous kindle. She loves it. Great product.
this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...
"This kindle replaces a previous model. The size is great, fits easily into purse or gym bag. The touch screen is a nice improvement over my earlier model. The backlit screen is good. Bright enough but not too bright. Overall, I am very pleased"
Very happy with this kindle. I purchased this kindle over the paperwhite due to the physical buttons.
bright screen which makes reading it day or night easy
"This beats my 2 older versions, hands down. Can either swipe or press to change pages. Easy. Really lightweight. Super!"
I'm So Happy I Bought This. It Goes Everywhere With Me. Best Thing I Have Purchased In A Long Time.
Bright backlight- amazing controls + Kindle features
I love the new kindle. I have a third generation and the new features are awesome.
"Great, lightweight, easy to carry and great picture for reading."
"Although the price is high, it is worth and useful."
Bought for my wife. She loves it. Reads it in bed and the light adjusts accordingly
"I bought this game for my son, and he loves it..it is very entertaining."
"I purchased this for my mom and she is totally in love with this reader. This has replaced her older Kindle from about 4-5 years ago and she appreciates the upgrade, especially the built-in backlight.Great product and a must-buy for avid book readers."
I was expecting better battery life cause they claim 6weeks of battery life. I am getting 3weeks. I wish it was little better than that. But that's my only issue
I would highly recommend this reader for anyone. Easy to download books and fast! Love the fonts and sizes. Lightweight. Great for travelers.
My daughter loves this; she is reading voraciously
"The only issue with this kindle is the price, otherwise, it's awesome. Light, compact, with a long battery life and tons of features... like an automatic backlight which is useful if you read at night."
The screen is very sharp and easy to use. The letters are crisp and distinctive. The back light works well in the dark or light. I have no problem reading at night in the dark or during the day outside in direct sunlight. The new page press buttons are perfectly placed and very convenient. It's light weight and small enough to hold in one hand whole reading. I only have to charge it every 2 weeks.I would recommend this edition to anyone who enjoys reading.
"It took awhile to get this Kindle as it was out of stock, but it was worth the wait. It is easy to use and the text is very clear. I have had a Kindle before but this model is so much better. Most enjoyable."
"I have several generations of Kindle readers, and this is far and away the best. It is relatively expensive, but the features are worth it."
"This was a gift for my wife, she had a previous version, and she loved the upgrade to tjis new version."
Upgraded from a Kindle paperwhite. I love the brighter screen and increased resolution. I am a book addict and the savings over printed material allows me to buy more books. The availability of reference texts is increasing which is a big plus.
My son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.
This kindle has better resolution and contrast ratio.It is light and comfortable. I would recommend this device at deal price.
Easy to use and get started with. Have had no issues at all and would recommend.
Good reader for travelers. It allows for people to read in a variety of environments.
"I had been reading on my iPad mini most of the time, but around the pool or at the beach, that was almost impossible. The Voyage is great not only in bright sunshine but inside, even in a pretty dark room. The back light is great for just about any environment. The battery life is fantastic."
"I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device."
I love the back light and has lots of memory. Very compact...easy to carry.
I purchased this for my son overseas as he had broken the screen on his last one. When he opened it he was amazed at the size and weight of this one. He also was very elated that all his books that he purchased immediately downloaded to the new one with his bookmarks in place. All in all a great purchase from an excellent company.
I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.
I wanted a reader that was easy to use indoor or outside. I am very pleased and so glad I purchased this product. Ordering books is also very easy.
The Kindle is very great reader and recommendable for people.
The technology just keeps getting better and better
"this is my first foray into purchasing a reader...I reviewed multiple sites and opinions before I made a move on this purchase...and not disappointed, can read anywhere in any light"
Makes reading outdoors enjoyable and I spend more time at the beach!
"I have never owned a Kindle and was using the Kindle ap for iPad for the last several years. This little device is remarkable. The page is crisp and clear, the navigation is so easy. Purchases are simple and straight forward. I love it!"
The Kindle Voyager has a very easy to read screen with great resolution.
the type resolution is fantastic and the screen brightness auto adjust compensates perfectly for both dark rooms and full sunshine on the beach!
"Lightweight, easy on the eyes, easy to use, many wonderful features"
"I have had several Kindles beginning with the 1st generation. I am an avid reader and I love that I can take my library with me. The Kindle Voyage is by far my favorite. The printed page is very clear and the lit page is wonderful. If you enjoy reading as much as I do, this is the e-reader for you."
I bought this after my Kindle Keyboard died. I like having a dedicated reader. Its easier on my eyes. Its light weight and fits in my purse with the cover on it. The ads don't bother me. Great purchase
"I had an original kindle that finally gave up the ghost after several years of service. I have been using my iPad mini as a reader, but it bothered my eyes after extended use. I like a dedicated reader like the voyager. It is about as close as you can come to an actual book. Love the adjustable backlot screen."
"Though not super noticible the resolution is better on the voyage. Also the fact that the screen doesn't dip in and is flat all the way across was a huge plus for me, having a toddler that spills stuff on it if I leave it lying around. The page turn button features on the sides are kinda pointless though. All in all, love it!"
Great reader. Bought it for my wife and she loves it
I've never really liked Kindle's for some reason or another. This one looked and felt really nice. I knew that I would love it as soon as I got it out of the box. It has a very premium feel and is a great substitute for a book.
This is my first kindle. I'm not sure how I lived without one now. The screen is excellent. I love being able to read outside (no glare!!) AND in bed (built in light!). Not sure how useful the automatic light adjuster is but it is a neat idea. Maybe as I use it more I will come to appreciate the automatic light adjustment.
I love my Kindle Voyage.... it's light and oh so easy to use... it's wonderful to have so many books in a portable format!
Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly
More confusing. It would be nice to have a manual that is not online.
"The flush bezel and display are a huge improvement. The text is crisp and easy on the eyes. The page press function and inclusion/position of the touch sensors is perfect. The price seems a bit high for something as simple as an E-Reader, but if you love to read this is a must have. You will not be disappointed."
My biggest gripe with it was the lack of directions. My first purchase went to the wrong card because I had no idea what the 1-click option was.
this was a choice between the Oasis and the Voyage. i made the right choice
this is a replacement for the kindle that i dropped. I love the new features of this model.
Prefect for all reading conditions and environments. I take it everywhere.
"Works great indoors & out. Very light weight & easy to carry, even in a pocket. Amazon downloads are easy & quick."
"This item was a replacement for a misplaced/lost Kindle Voyage. It is my go-to eReader, compact, light-weight, and read anywhere (bright sun, shade, at nite) device. The Kindle Paperwhite could have been equally useful, but I was spoiled with the Voyage. As a note, I also have an iPadMini and an iPad Air2, but they are much heavier to lug around."
"This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power."
I really like not having the bump on the bottom like the previous Kindle reader like the previous Kindle readerI dislike the fact that the screen is not recessed like the previous Kindle reader so that you cannot set the unit down facedown
It is a very solid E-Reader. Nothing wrong with it at all.
I had used the Kindle Paperwhite for quite awhile before I got intrigued by the Voyage seeing it in person. I was apprehensive about upgrading given the higher cost but it was entirely worth it. The Paperwhite is lite in weight but somehow the Voyage feels weightless. The screen is absolutely beautiful and to me the nicest feature is the screen is flush with the bezel around. Little learning curve to the page press on the side but tweaking the settings a little I have it down now.
The better resolution and slightly smaller size makes a worthwhile investment if you read for hours. The commercials that tell you how much better it is to read on a Kindle Voyage vs a tablet are true. I read for hours at a time on weekly plane trips. If I use a tablet my eyes hurt after just a couple of hours. On a Kindle because of the side lighting I can read for 5 hours and my eyes never hurt .
I love the kindle voyage. My favorite feature is that I can read while at the beach!! It's also very lightweight and fits in one hand.
I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.
"Kindle is the best. In this version, storage and resolution screen has been improved."
This is an incredible product. I would much rather read on this than my iPad!
Reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly
"User friendly and features a 4GB capacity for ample storage. PagePress provides reimagined page turns, and an adaptive front light promotes visibility in dimly lit areas. So far so good!"
"Kindle Voyage is great, screen resolution is awesome, love the new page turn buttons (I missed these ones from my previous Kindle keyboard)."
I like this Kindle Voyage. There is plenty of storage. The page turning is perfect.
"Amazon nailed it. Its readability is superior to the book. The new page turning feature is a great improvement over the previous version. And, BTW, you can carry a library with you wherever you go."
Hy husband loves his kindle.the back light so he can read anywhere with low eye strain is awsome
I love my kindle! It never runs out of battery. Used it on a three week detachment and never had to charge it.
Purchased after theft in Seattle. It was on sale and works great.
"so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one...."
"Lost my ""paper white"" in airplane, have to buy new one. Voyage is latest model, I like it. Friend of mine wants one as well with my recommendation, so, bought two. Nice to have them!"
It is a great investment. Can read at night without disturbing partner. Only disadvantage is if you lose your place it is a little difficult to find it. This could be user problem.
I like the size and battery life. It would be nice to have instant definitions for foreign language books. I really like the vocabulary review.
Got this for a family member who had on older Kindle that stopped working. They absolutely love it.
Purchased for my 83 years young husband who is an avid reader. Getting his books instantly was worth his fear of going to a kindle. He's surprised at the ease of use.
"Goal: get an e- reader that allows one to read in any light situation. Goal achieved. Reading on the patio, beach is great. Easy to download books, lightweight, good battery life are all pluses"
Better than older kindles. Reading a book on a kindle is easier than holding a book.
"When my Kindle Paper White was damaged (my fault), I was looking for a replacement. After reading many reviews online, both from ""experts"" and normal users, I chose the Voyager. I've been very satisfied with it. I particularly like the pressure sensitive edges for turning pages."
"I had an old Sony e-reader that I loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. I decided that a Kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now. (Looked at Kobo also). So far, I like it. Great screen, backlight on mine doesn't have the problems that others have complained about."
"I am an avid reader, and have purchased both the first and second generations of the Kindle Paperwhite products. Upon reading about the Voyage, I knew I had to have one. Although it's a bit pricey for an e-reader, it's definitely worth it for me. As much as I read, I believe the new screen will result in less eye strain. It's a beauty to look at. Especially when held next to the Paperwhite 2nd gen and compared."
"The new voyage is so much better. They've made some major improvements. I love that you can swipe, or use the side controls. The writing is crystal clear. The batter life lasts forever. I recommend this to anyone!"
"I know it is entirely a personally bias, but I love Kindles and this is one of the best Kindles ever."
It will be great if the screen is larger. Otherwise it is good.
I read a lot so I wanted a light weight device. It's user friendly. You can adjust the brightness of light and turn pages easily. It fits nicely in my bag. I take it everywhere. I highly recommend it!
"Pros - weight is super light, small size, long battery, I fell it to floor a few times and screen didn't breakCons - it takes half second for the next page to appear on screen when turning pages, similar to ""fade in"" animation in PowerPoint. I would prefer more seemless appearance of next page."
"To begin with this is the best reader available right now. Brighter than the pw2. Just awesome. Whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. Either way, it's a great piece of hardware- light, good grip, light etc. there is one HUGE issue however! The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2."
"Love the backlight, great feature. Very light weight almost too much so."
"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it."
"The Kindle Voyage is light weight, slim. easy to use and so far has been a good product. The page turns very easily and the light works very well. The anti glare screen is the best!"
had the larger paper white replaced with this model. LOVE IT!
Has an efficient battery and works well. I've had every Kindle since the second generation and it is my favorite to date. I love the Amazon distressed leather cover.
"The more I thought about using my phone to read ebooks, the less I wanted to read. But the Voyage has gotten me back into reading. Light. Holds charge for week at least. Only request is I wish it could do white letters on black at night."
"The new design is lighter, has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!"
have owned 2 kindles this is far the best. no light required. simple to use
Great product love the auto adjusting black lightLove the weight of the kindle light enough I can hold it with one hand an turn the pages
"i really like the voyage, it looks great, and worth the money."
"I purchased both this and paperwhite, but it turns out I like it better than paperwhite even it cost me 20 bucks more."
I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.
Previous one lost so wanted the same kind since I knew this was the best. It is my third Kindle and I love it.
"I have used both paperwhite and voyage, and voyage has improved its support on the files, allowing you to customize the format especially when you are reading in a foreign language."
i was skeptical but glad I purchased. much faster than Nook or the paperwhite. Thin and easy to use. Screen appears brighter and wider than the paperwhite. Very thin and lightweight
I love the adjustable font size and the front light which allows me to read in any lighting even without my glasses. Pagepress allows me to turn page effortlessly and i can close my book turning it off and when i resume reading I'm right back where i left off. Love it. Capacity is unbelievable.
Had the older model that didn't light up... Was always having to get to a lamp. Now I can read anywhere without any worries. The light adjusts as needed. I get lost in my book without any worries. The screen is perfect size with great clarity and easy to travel with.
Always great to upgrade new from old version when the staff is always knowledgeable
Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.
"Easy to navigate, I love it despite the charging port. Charging port doesn't last very long though. Just purchased my second one."
even my luddite spouse loves it. Easy to use. Read in full sunlight.
Great ereader. Light and easy to use. Only issue is a bit pricey.
I love the new kindle. So much brighter then my old one.
I love this. We love to travel and now I can download a bunch of books to read on our trips. Now that I have this I don't know how I survived those long flights without it.
"It took me a long time to buy an e-reader because I just love real books. But I am happy I bought this and so far, after a few months, I've experienced none of the discoloration that other users have mentioned about previous versions. Very happy with it."
My daughter enjoys her kindle. Lovethis product!!
"My first ebook reader. Read some reviews, decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light. Sometimes I have to adjust the light manually but no biggie, quick and easy on the eyes."
"My husband loves his new kindle. Lightweight, fast, and the origami cover is great."
"My paperwhite died, so I went with the voyage, and I'm loving it. It's basically the same as the paperwhite, with the addition of sensors on the side to turn the page if you don't want to swipe the screen. And of course faster processor, etc."
"So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc."
why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now!
"I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page."
Absolutely love my new Kindle Voyager. Lightweight and compact size makes it easier to carry with me everywhere I go. Wish I had bought one sooner.
"Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area). Sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!"
Highly recommend. Battery is perfect. Light weight too!
"The Voyage is my first eReader and I am not disappointed. It is light, clear and a joy to use"
Small and easy to carry in my purse. I like that I can change the page on the sides without consistently dirtying the screen with fingerprints.
Very light weight and easy to read in different lighting conditions. Does not strain my eyes like the kindle fire if reading at night. I do wish Bestbuy carried more options for cases to fit the Voyage. They have none in the store at all.
"I love my kindle for reading over my iPad now. Best buy gave me a good deal on this kindle, and fast and friendly service. This kindle is easy on my sensitive eyes and a pleasure to hold. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an e-reader."
I had one of the original Kindles and I found that I just absolutely quit reading and it was because of the bulk and size of the Kindle. I decided to give this one a try and I absolutely love it and I'm back to reading every day and the reason is because it is more the size of a paperback. It's lightweight and I love that I can read at night without having have a light on. I did however purchase The Geek Squad protection after my dog that was sitting in my lap almost said it flying to the floor when he jumped up out of my lap
This is my second Kindle purchased. First one was 15 years ago and now the Kindle Voyage 2. I love my Kindle. You can read anywhere even outside in the sun. I read more than ever :)
This kindle is a great product. I really enjoy it.
I am very please with my Kindle Voyage. The size is perfect and the control lighting is exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend this to anyone.
"This is the best Kindle yet and I am loving it! For someone who suffers from eye strain but loves to read, the 300 dpi image resolution and the liquid ink technology are beyond compare. Buy it, you won't regret it!!"
"I waited for weeks to get this new model and am happy I did. I love the new features on the Kindle Voyage. Didn't give it 5 stars due to some difficulty with the pressure sensitive buttons. I don't know if it is a flaw with the design or operator error, but sometimes it is more challenging than I think it should be to get the page to turn. It is far easier to swipe the screen so this is what I typically do. But, regardless. . . I love the Voyage! It was definitely worth the wait!"
"So happy with this Kindle! It's very easy to use, lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book, except here you have an entire library with you."
"Love it, love it!!! Have had several different models. like this one the best. The Kindle Fire was nice but had a hard time reading at night."
New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage.
"One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)"
"The touch page Turner is great, you don't have to finger swipe. Although it does take a little more pressure to use than I like I still think it is a great feature."
"I upgraded from the Kindle Touch so I could have a built in light. The light is fantastic. While it took some getting used to the press buttons for page turning on the side, I love that too. Can use it with one hand, and don't have to take hands off to touch the screen. The documentation could use some work. A diagram with what all those icons are that they refer to would be a big help. Took me a long time to figure out how to get the reading progress to what I wanted. One thing, I HATE the new bookmark method. The old 'corner fold' was easier and less intrusive. Still can figure out how to delete from My Clippings. Also I wish Amazon would come out with a case similar to an Otter Box. I don't want leather OR auto turn on, which seems to be problematic on nearly every case I look at."
It is more lightweight than my keyboard kindle 3. Love it
I would recommend this product. It works great and ver compact.
"I previously had a first edition paper white and finally pulled the trigger on a voyage. I'm so glad I did, the resolution is great and it seems easier to read. I also like that the screen is completely flat. I don't really use the page turn buttons like I thought i would but it is nice to have the option."
I previously own a kindle paperwhite version one then upgraded to kindle voyage.big difference. Worth the price!
Replacing my original white page Kindle. I love these readers! Like the new auto adjust backlight! Also like the new page turner slides on the sides of the screen. Great product!
"Easy to use. Comfortable to hold-lightweight and good size. The light adjustment is great. Easy to inadvertently turn the page-sometimes more than one-still trying to figure out how not to do that. Over all, though very happy with it"
I was in need of a new Kindle. We were going on several trips and I needed it immediately . The person at Best Buy that helped me was excellent! He helped thru the entire setting up process. I walked out a very satisfied customer.
Was a late christmas gift to myself. Updated from the paperwhite 2 and the difference is very noticeable.
"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. It says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know."
"This reader is much more comfortable to hold than the Paperwhite. It is not quite as light as the Nook Glowlight, but the screen is much sharper."
The screen is great outside but the biggest difference is the speed of page refresh. Having the page turn buttons back on the side is awesome!
Lightweight easy read easy page turning self adjusting read light great too.
So many improvements over previous models. Love the new page turn feature.
love kindles and this one is the best one made by amazon. but expensive.
"Wow! it is so nice to have a light and easy to hold device that only carries tons of books! No distractions like on my iPad, with email messages pinging in and facebook updates to check...just books and lots of them!The Kindle Voyage is everything they said it would be...light, back lit with self adjusting levels, page turners, all the bells and whistles. I am so glad I waited and splurged for this one!"
So user friendly that I had it for over a month before I read the owners guide to learn all the other features. Makes reading a book effortless. A must have for the avid book reader.
Purchased for my mother for Christmas. She hasn't put it down since.
Son loves it and uses it all e time but I wish it would share my audible acct so e would read what I listen to without us having to buy some items in two formats.. Recommended
This is my 3rd Kindle and I think its the best yet! Love the new features and will never go back to paperback books again
"Since my Kindle Paperwhite died, this new Voyage has been a good replacement."
"I like it. However, when reading the page number is not shown. Also unable to use the dictionary. Still in the 'new' stage."
"I exchanged the paper white that I had bought for this Voyage. This is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. Still getting used to the archive system since I had a Nook before, bit of a learning curve. But I like the Kindle interface better than the Nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. The only thing I miss is that the Kindle doesn't tell you what % battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol."
the reader is very compact so it can easliy fit into a bag or pocket. The auto light feature is also a plus.it takes a little bit to get adjusted to the side tabs and presume that future versions of this device will be improved upon.
"I bought this as a replacement for an older model Kindle my father wore out. Unfortunately, he cannot remember the email and password for the older model, so I cannot transfer the thousands of books he has to the new Kindle. Always write down that important information somewhere, it will make life a lot easier!"
"I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it."
Very nice and easy to use and the kindle is great.
Was a Christmas gift and I ended up returning it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
"We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent."
"Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly!"
"Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice"
"Extra features are nice and upgrading from the Kindle Paperwhite was fairly simple. Amazon did an automatic system update which was not cool. There should have been an option to update when we wanted, not when they wanted."
New Kindle Voyage is a nice upgrade from the basic model. Smaller e reader with a brighter light. So far so good.
"Great for reading any book, light weight, easy to use best Kindle on the market."
It has what i wanted click to turn page and that is the only reason i paid that price for it. there is nothing special about it. i thhought that the battery would last longer and as an avid reader it doesn't last long enough.
Replaced a v1 nook but this is not better for reading
"Clear screen, buttons act up a little. After numerous days of review I feel that this was the best option."
Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.
"My wife and I both enjoyed our Kindle Voyage so much that we had to buy a second one. This is our first E-reader, and it could not be more user-friendly. It works well in all kinds of environments and lighting conditions. A definite winner!"
"Turning,sometimes the pages turn when your not aware of it. The battery length is much better."
the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.
"the screen flush with the sides is great. The glass feeling is really nice. I don't use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit. They are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages. But, the price is painful. It is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect."
The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage.
Perfect e-reader with great screen and backlight. Works great in every condition. Definitely recommend the Kindle Voyage!
Love this product. Glad I upgraded! The features make it easy to read while traveling by car or plane.
"I find myself reading even more now that I have the Kindle Voyage. It is easy to hold and maneuver, the perfect size, small and sleek. Page turning is easy with one hand and the back light makes reading in any setting a pleasure."
"I've enjoyed the original Kindle (with keyboard) for many years, and it was finally time to upgrade. The light is great, and I use the page press buttons exclusively. Very happy with the size, weight, and appearance of this product."
"My wife cannot put this device down. Crystal clear image and great for those long airplane rides. This is a very lightweight device, very functional and very user-friendly."
Love my Kindle! I take it with me everywhere! I would recommend this to all my friends and family!
"If you are a digital reader, you need a Kindle. This is excellent, but expensive. If you are a casual reader you will probably be happy with a less expensive Kindle. I do recommend a case."
pros - light compact bright fast response from touch screencons- hard to navigate. I use my old kindle with buttons to browse. This kindle can be frustratingwith its overly sensitive touch screen.Overall a very good reader but no need to purchase if happy with paperwhite versions. For someone new to kindle it is worth the price as long as have another electronic device to browse the kindle site.
Ergonomic and easy to get new books. My house is full of books and I need to quit stockpiling them. And I can't remember what I read years ago. This device helps.
"I have had both older E-ink Kindle and Nook readers as well as the larger color screen versions and this new one is the best one yet. Very light, portable, battery lasts a long time. The screen is much better than the older E-ink Kindle. I recently binged through the 4th book of Game of Thrones, and it was an easy read on the Kindle. I highly recommend this to any reader. My teenage daughter also enjoys reading on the Kindle as well as opposed to the regular books."
Coming from a nook reader. Love the even backlighting and weight.
"Never thought I would enjoy reading again because reading a boundbook made my eyes to tired to finish one. With the Voyage, I don't get that feeling."
Very easy and portable I take it everywhere with me
"I enjoy how small this version is, although if you are looking for a lot of features, I would recommend other Kindle products. Pretty much, this is similar to carrying around a paperback book in size and portability."
"First of all I'm amazed I could buy it from Best Buy, while Amazon says it will be in stock on December 1st (in more than a month from now). Best Buy is indeed the best!The Voyage itself is simply fantastic. The size is right, it's very lightweigh, quite zippy, text is super crisp, and I love the auto-brightness feature."
"The automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but I find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.I like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen. I also appreciate the flat surface, it doesn't seem to attract as much dust in the corners like my other kindles."
"I like the small, light weight size, and the adaptive lighting. But the page turning is too sensitive, skipping ahead many pages when I am just moving the Kindle, and going back and then forward when I am trying to change just one page."
"The new Kindle Voyage is quite a step forward for the Kindle dedicated reader line. It is a beautiful device - almost like something from Apple. I like the lighted screen and the page forward and back ""buttons"" on the sides of the device. But it is rather pricey - not yet convinced it is worth the upcharge."
"I love my new Kindle! I have owned them all and each one improves on the last. It's a great way to read! I have the origami book cover as well and did not expect to like it but actually, I love it!"
This is my first e-reader and it was just the best choice I could have ever made.
Love the new look and feel of my new Kindle Voyage. I especially love how it adjusts the reading light automatically.
"This new kindle is so much easier to read than my second generation kindle that I had for years. It is faster, and the back-light can be adjusted easily to get the right amount of light for your reading pleasure. If you love books, you should get this."
I enjoy my kindle and would recommend to anyone. There is a good choice of books and reading material also.
"Got this as an upgrade to my Kindle Touch. Page turns are crisp (the pressure-sensitive page buttons on the sides are a nice addition). I especially like the self-adjusting brightness. Very happy with the purchase. Battery life is great so far, even with the backlight on."
"I am extremely pleased with my Kindle Voyage. It lives up to the hype. It is slightly smaller and lighter than the previous version. The ambient light monitor works well. Text is clear and very readable. My only negative comment would be that the battery does not seem to last as long as I expected. I have recently retired; so I am reading more. I recharge the reader about every week and a half. That said, I am reading indoors and perhaps the ambient backlighting is on more than normal."
It's a great screen and extremely lightweight to hold. Perfect!
I purchased this for my girl friend and she absolutely loves it. She reads around 3-4 books a week.
"This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks."
my 8 year old son has a new found passion for reading now that he is using this kindle.
"This Kindle makes reading even more enjoyable. Very light in the hand, amazing back light. Very highly recommended."
"The Kindle Voyage is the best e-reader experience available. Text is super-sharp, it's comfortable to hold, the built-in self-adjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. Unfortunately, all those great features come at a $199 price that is $80 more than Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right. So five stars for the device itself and minus one star for the high price."
Love the small size and the auto light. Use this every day.
"excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different (I adore the flatness so much), and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. IMO, worth the cost"
"when I compare the screen of this voyage to my previous paperwhite, the qualify of the display was much better. light is more even and soft."
"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device."
I was a little bit hesitant to get the Voyage over the Paperwhite and after holding the two I knew I wanted the Voyage. This device has been perfect! (Advice: Ask Amazon to remove the ads if you're a Prime member!)
"To advance the page or go back to the previous one, just press lightly on a pair of gray lines and dots on either side of the front bezel. Is nice to see the transition. This Kindle is readable in any light. There‚Äôs even an optional ""Nightlight"" mode that gradually changes the brightness. Lastly, the power button has been moved back here from the bottom edge."
I have been a Kindle reader for years now but this is the first device I have used with a backlight and I have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever. For a pure reading device I do not know how it could be better other than lowering the price tag.
I bought this unit for my daughter who loves to read but sometimes get frustrated by the size format of paper books and the weight of traditional tablets. The e-ink is super easy to read and the unit weighs next to nothing. A bit spendy for something you can only use to read on but so so nice to use.
"This is a really great upgrade from the regular Kindle, however, it's not such an appealing product after Amazon updated the base Kindle to the same hi-resolution screen. May be worth waiting to see if Amazon upgrade the Voyage over the coming months."
"This is my third kindle and is the best by far. The smaller size is great because it fits nicely in my purse so I never leave home without it. Other great features are page turning, adjusting light and weight."
This is the reading machine I will recommended for everyone. The sharp font and responsiveness is unparalleled
We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.
Text is clear. Nice not to have the battery die every few days like a conventional tablet.
This is very easy to read and just the right size and weight to carry.
Good replacement for a paperwhite. The addition of the page forward and page backward buttons is huge!
"easy to read, great product When I use different readers they keep tract of where I am in each."
"This is definitely an improvement over the paperwhite, not sure is worth the premium though. While faster than paperwhite it is still way less responsive than an iPad, it is very hard to type on it (when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance).I like the navigation areas on the edge of the screen but I'm not crazy about them. I'm not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that comfortable while reading in bed. I guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely.I previously had a Paperwhite which got lost and I thought I'd better buy the latest kindle now.When I bought the paperwhite it has been an experiment, as I'm not an avid reader and I have a hard time reading paper book since I got surrounded by gadgets. I actually read few books on the paperwhite and I enjoyed it. So when I lost it (misplaced it) I was longing for it as I had few books I wanted to read.If this would be priced at least $50 cheaper I think it would be a 5 star proposition. Like it is now, it is a tad too expensive for the scope and the shortcomings. Closer to $100 it would be a sweet price.Prefered buying at BestBuy over Amazon as the loyalty programs are better (vs nonexistent) and I also used a movers coupon."
very good produ ct and service will defintely refer to a freind.
"I purchased this to replace my first gen Paperwhite. The shadows on the bottom of the Paperwhite always bothered me. I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually. But that's a small issue for an otherwise great e-reader."
This good e-reader is a gift for my daughter and she love it.
This was a move up from the Paper White reader. I like the option of touch screen or using the pressure switches on on the side which you can adjust to your pressure that you prefer. Sharp fonts refresh is fast and clean.
"I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present. She loves it, much better than the old Sony reader she had which had limited books and was much more expensive."
Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light.
"I like this Kindle, but I am not sure it is worth the premium over the Paperwhite. I previously had a Kindle Fire, which was fine, but this is definitely nicer for reading. But it all depends on what you need it for, and how often you will use it."
This Kindle is exactly what my wife wanted and has worked out wonderfully.
I love my Kindle Voyage. It truly is almost like reading a paper book.
I bought this for my kids and very happy with that.
Bought this reader for a present for my mom. She loves it. Able to take her book with her in a smaller form loves how it looks like paper pages. Easy to order a new book.
Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it.
This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great.
"My husband is bed bound and sometimes very weak. The kindle is great for him ,light easy to use and the back light allows him to read in bed without waking me to turn the lights on."
Although expensive....is exactly what you would expect.
"Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun..."
Great product. She uses it everyday. Super light and easy to navigate.
I purchased this to replace a 2nd generation Kindle for my wife. She wanted it because of the backlight. The item exceeded her expectations. Great battery life too. I took he old kindle but plan to buy me one of these in the future.
"Bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. She has really enjoyed it. It is easy on her eyes, light weight, and keeps a god charge. It is easy to use, but she does already have experience using the original Kindle."
The KINDLE VOYAGE is a wonderful product and I use it everyday for my reading. I take it to lunch and dinner each day.
"I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the ""official"" cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing)."
"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this."
No regrets with this device. The Paperwhite from Amazon is a cheaper model that's worth looking into if this model is too much. I used to read on various iOS/Android tablets but wanted to get something that allows me to read ebooks but also have weeks of battery life on a single charge. All those books on such a small and thin device is still amazing to me. This and the official Amazon case is what I use.
"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though."
Upgraded from an old 2nd gen kindle and this is much better
"I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White."
"This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it."
I am an avid reader. I use to have to pack multiple books on any vacation or trip for business. This has replaced all that. This is my second kindle and I am very impressed. The back light helps for reading at night or in bright places.
I love the Voyage. The display is clean and crisp and I have found the auto adjusting lighting to work perfectly for me. I love the side page turning buttons. I no longer have to use two hands to read a book anymore.
I work for Nespresso so I have a lot of capsules. I absolutely LOVE the capsule drawers. So much neater than having the sleeves piled on top of each other.
"I find it amusing to ask Alexa simple questions and timers. Not liking the messaging part that doesn't integrate with my iPhone, but it has awesome notifications and does sync with my Google calendar. I feel it was an EXCELLENT purchase."
"This is my second Echo. The first one I purchased at Home Depot for 139. I knocked it off my nightstand a few times with no damage. The last time it fell, it completely died. So now it's just after Christmas and they are few and far between to purchase one. Amazon has a back order for almost a month for 179 and eBay tries to rape you with prices up to 300. I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused. That is all."
Very clear picture on monitor easy to install with mobile phone and quite enjoyable to ask questions Alexa is very informative.
"After researching The Amazon Echo and the Google Home equivalent, I decided to go with the Echo since that one was recommended for Apple users. I found the set up to be easy and very user friendly. I love it!"
I ordered the first generation Amazon Echo which wasn't easy to find by the way. I absolutely love it. The sound quality is great! I have it in my living room to play music which I can hear in all of my downstairs rooms. I couldn't be more pleased!
"Amazon Echo Plus is a fun product it requires time to explore its skills. It copes well with accents, however the Echo have to be placed as center as possible to get the best listening results. It is a great first step towards a smart home but there are more accessories required to connect the house together. If you live outside of US you may find some of the features limited at the moment. Hopefully this will change with time and also more skills will be available for local services."
Just what I expected...Works great....
I like using Amazon Echo for playing calming music to help me fall asleep. I use it to play nature sounds for my dog while I am away.
"Like this version the best. The new version does not give you much of a choice for colors and you can get a skin for the 1st generation version. The speaker is great, fills the room with sound. Replaced an Echo Dot which sucked...wouldn't stay connected to the external speaker, always having to pair it or reconnect it to the internet, etc. Plugged this one in and it worked right away."
"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
great tablet for kids when traveling. my grandchild loves it.
I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.
"Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all."
"Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter."
Best buy ever for my 3 year old. Only purchased because they were out of the Galaxy tablet. I'm glad. This tablet is PERFECT for my 3 year old. I love that it has 2 modes. The kids mode sometimes freeze and takes a minutes for apps to open. Also didn't download Netflix movies like indicated. But regular mode works great. My daughter loves watching weird homemade youtube movies anyway.
I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.
"bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier."
This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)
My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever.
I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own .
"A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing."
The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped."
"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!
Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost.
"My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose."
My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.
"Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,"
"My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!"
Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It's great.
My son is 4 and he loves it. Super easy to use for kids.
my 6 year old granddaughter loves her new tablet. she uses it to play games and download movies.
"This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!"
A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. Great deal on a great product.
"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed.
"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive."
"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.
"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version.
"I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
the tablet is just the right size for our granddaughter. she loves it. she can play her little games and has so much fun with it.
I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.
This is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.
We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.
The Kindle Fire HD 8 is great for users of all types!
"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
"Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!"
"This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.)"
I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device .
"I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it's a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that's alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games!"
"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste."
"This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems
Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.
"Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!"
My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.
The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
"Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money."
The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.
"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her."
this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users."
This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal
I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.
I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!
My daughter loves this. There are so many settings and you don't have to buy every app individual. So many books and educational apps :)
My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it
"Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones"
Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it
Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
"I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up."
Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
"The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great."
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.

"I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked."
My granddaughter loves this tablet. She is two and has no problem playing the games and using this tablet. It's very user friendly and keeps her busy for hours.
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips
Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily
4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.
"The latest Amazon 8"" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet"
Love the color pink for granddaughter she loves carrying around her own tablet. Wonderful product. love the safety protective case great unit.
Excellent tablet for the price. We bought it as a child's tablet to surf and play games. Has tons of free apps for kids.
For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.
I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.
I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!!
I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
These are great devices for the price. Good performance and awesome warranty. Having the Freetime is also very nice as app purchases are less frequent.
this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover
"It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it."
"Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot."
"I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it."
"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
"I'm truly elated with the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet. I originally purchased this product specifically to attached to my Tablet Holder on my Nordic Track Treadmill, which already has a built-in tablet. However, I was so taken back by the versatility of the Fire HD 8 tablet that I decided to use the tablet as my everyday ""walk-about"" computer tablet instead on placing on my treadmill which I only use 1 to 3 times per week. I totally recommend the Fire HD 8 Tablet which on sale cost about $69.00."
"We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10"" version."
meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
"We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this"
Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use.
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
"Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!"
The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it!
"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely."
"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
"Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend."
Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire.
"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
Purchased for my niece and she loves it. I like the fact I can set limits on her tablet and restrict her access until she has read. Only downside is the case doesn't have a kickstand so that the tablet can be placed upright for viewing videos/movies. But a new case can be purchased.
Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke
"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
"Excellent product. My grandson loves it. Fast, easy to use and yet challenging enough that he is learning at the same time"
"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!
I got this tablet for my 3 year old granddaughter. She enjoys it and it keeps her busy and learning. Everything rolled into one for her.
This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life."
This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.
"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80"
"If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed
Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy
I bought this for my son and I couldn't be happier. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends
"I didn't know how well he would do with a full blown tablet, but I am shocked at how well he navigates it ON HIS OWN. He does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. His letter understanding (he's 3.5) has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. Plus, it's a great motivation tool. I love it, and he does, too."
"Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it"
"Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc."
Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.
Great Christmas gift for my son. Best tablet ever.
"Great for kids, bought both colors for two of my kids."
Great for kids. Bought both colors for two of my kids.
"Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well!"
Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price
Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must
"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning
Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution
Great tablet with good parental controls for kids!!
Have had other products similar for the kids but this is the best by far. Best Buy had a great price too so decided to try it. Love it.
I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.
I have been using this for a bit now. It's wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer.
I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
"I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick."
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account
KIDS LOVE THEM. THEY ARE VERY DURABLE. VERY USER FRIENDLY.
My 4 year old loves it. I love that she can use it unsupervised without worry. She has been learning her alphabet and this has been a great tool.
My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!
My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.
My little 8 year old guy loves this kindle. Couldn't imagine a better Christmas gift.
My son is a huge fan of it and I love that I can control what he watches and plays
"No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem"
Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints
"Sweet tablet yo, does good work for my grandma and super easy"
This is a great little tablet especially for the price.
This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.
"this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse"
"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!"
This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful.
Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children.
Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!!
This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it
I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need
I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend!
This is all around a great tablet. My 1yr old can use it with ease. Also love how we can change the profiles to suit adults as well. Would recommend to anyone and all ages.
"This is the perfect tablet for a toddler. I feel like there is stuff for him to now, but he can also grow with it. And it's built like a tank."
I bought this for my 4 year old she loves it never outs if down
"My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!"
Very awesome tablet for kids and great parental controls
My 3 year old has gone through 2 tablets prior to her kids fire. I love the parental control and easy use. She loves the apps available through Prime! She drops it daily with no damage to the tablet thanks to the protective case! Thanks for making a very durable product with an incredible warranty!
I bought this as a gift for my grandkids. They absolutely love it!
Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!!
I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!!
Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
"Bought as Christmas gift. He loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
"Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
This is an excellent tool to help our granddaughter advance her learning skills and also allows her an opportunity to play educational games
I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her.
Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.
"Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed."
"I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it."
Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.
Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages
Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video.
Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.
My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down!
"My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working."
Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it
Picture quality is so much nicer than my old reader.
"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi."
Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
"Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices."
A great small tablet - works very well for a young person.
Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix
Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat.
Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.

"Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet."
"Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far."
Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too.
Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone.
This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
"This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend."
"This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all!"
Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly
Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!
If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
"Bought as a gift for my nephew, have one for my son already. Love this product"
"for the price you cant beat this, my daughter loves it and wont put it down and the protective case def helps when it is dropped trust me , cannot go wrong with a kindle for this price"
I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.
Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad
This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops.
"I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses."
This is a great tablet. My grandson uses it to watch his cartoons. We also have ABC Mouse that he uses on it. It's very durable and he loves it!!
My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.
Love the amount of time we can set that she can be on this! The bumper guard has been handy. Apps that were on it are awesome. Best of all she loves it!
Easy to set up. Durable for toddlers. Highly recommend.
"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone."
"Love this tablet, great value, come with great protective case, preloaded apps are an awesome feature. The included 2 year protection is also a plus."
Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!
Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
The granddaughter loves it and she can't put it down.
I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating.
My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...
Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.
LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She's have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it.
Arrived yesterday as promised! Little one loves it
bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for
Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.
My 3 yr old loves her new tablet and my wife and I are glad to get ours back. Very simple usage. Has all of her favorite apps on it.
My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She
This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!
Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.
It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids
Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.
"Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults."
"Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos."
My son loves his tablet. It is very easy to use. Very stutdy.
"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
"Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
"I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift."
Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.
"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it
This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
"Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
was one of the best thangs i got for my little one
"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa."
very good product in its price range affordable and very good
We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
"This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds."
"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price.
Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter!
"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
"This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it's worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:)"
This is the best child's tablet and some adults like me can benefit from the warranty and matched case
"I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance."
Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.
"I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader."
Cool tab. Must buy for kids. Amazon need load apps
My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.
"Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!"
Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
I needed this for my daughter and needed a tablet that cal handle all my daughters apps and have parental saggy This has it all
"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.
"Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc"
"Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
I bought this for my grandson and it hasn't disappointed me at all! He loves his tablet! I am looking at buying his sister one next!
"purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it."
Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school.
This is one of the best tabs for kids to start with.Rugged and sophisticated.
My daughter loved it . Best gift for the price it comes with way more then I could have expected
This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
"The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
"Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids."
Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
"My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome"
"We have been through several tablets, most made for children. This one is the very best one we have ever had. The cover stays on and does not impede use at all. My child has never bothered to take it off. Very easy to use, great Amazon content. I recommend it to anyone that will listen."
Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
I bought this and onother one in blue. The kids love it.
"I'm a father of two. Both of my kids (6) & (10) got iPads last year for Christmas and love them, but I felt the iPad was lacking a little of what they really need. Purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. Perfect kids tablet. Don't make the mistake I did and go with the IPad. This product nails it in every aspect the iPad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet"
The best tablet for kids the 1 year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it..
"I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!!"
This is the second one I bought. My older son wouldn't share his so for Christmas santa brought little brother one lol. The apps that come with the subscription are endless. I also have Netflix and both kids watch different shows on it too. I once bought a sprout cubby tablet and it broke within 2 days and the customer service was terrible they would not replace and actually wanted to charge more than I paid. The customer service with amazon however is fantastic and replaced my sons tablet when it cracked within 3 days!! They are durable but my older toddler is Just a crazy lil man. You won't regret buying this for your kids.
I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
"Bought it for our 2 year old son, has really helped with his vocabulary"
I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.
Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.
I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
Son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. Nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. No questions asked.
"Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.
"I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!"
"This tablet is one of the best.You won't regret buying this one.Good work,Amazon."
"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
"Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use."
my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.
"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse."
"Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it."
Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.
"I purchased the Fire Tablet basically as an e-reader. However, after finding out how to install the Google Play Store, it is much more. Nothing speedy or top of the line, but what would one expect for the price. No regrets!"
Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.
Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read
I have owned a kindle before & prefer it to an ipad
"Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
"Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
"I already had the Kindle Fire 7"", and this KF8 not only has a bigger picture screen but is faster."
Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it's so much faster!
Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
"My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did."
"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
"Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night."
Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .
We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly.
Better then the older models bigger and better then before
Her big brother got one so she needed it too! She is pretty good at it!
Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names."
"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
Bought it for mothers day and she hasn't put it down yet.
"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
Love the idea of it. Not as easy to put the DVD movies on it .
I got this because it is almost impossible to break
"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
Bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn't broken it either.
Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again!
I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.
it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.
"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
"This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.
"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
Takes way to long to get a full charge. Other then that works great would be better if it had a better camera on it
It would have been nice if the charging cord was more compatible with other devices.
The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
ƒ∞t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance
My godchild loves this tablet. Easy to use and kid friendly. Also allows parents to set controls and I love that
"Great gift, for my kid's second birthday! This product is very child friendly and easy to use! I recommend this product for families!"
My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
This is the way to go for an all-in-one package for the kids. Everything is set-up and easily controlled through adult log in...
Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.
This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.
This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.
"This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy."
"This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!"
I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.
I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn't downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them.
"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update
Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
"This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it."
"This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
So far it begin good for my 4yrs old toddler. She enjoy every minute of it.The parental control it's a plus. It also allow you to make multiple kid and adults profiles without any problems issues.
Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.
"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
"Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer"
When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn't know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need.
I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.
Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!
"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet."
Great price for product. It's get of you have kids.
"nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate"
"My daughter is learning so much from the games on this device, my wife was glad I bought it."
Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!!
Got this for my 3 year old due to it having the bumper and I will tell you it's well worth it. I couldn't tell you how many times its been dropped and survives every time.
Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
"My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!"
"Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?"
This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained
I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs .
"This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market."
I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
Purchased this for my son. Decent tablet but not optimum
"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
"Got this for my 4 year old daughter, she enjoys playing games and reading books. A faster processor would me it better."
"Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work."
We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
"Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
"I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
Good tablet althought the availability of apps thru their appstore is limited.
"Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good."
"Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well..."
returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
"Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it"
Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.
It's difficult to navigate and not user friendly. I was hoping for better results
"Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight."
"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!"
"I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE"
"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
My Mistake to buy for 1yr old.But my 30yr old son enjoys it!
Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.
"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product."
Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."

All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."
"If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to."
There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
Great for the kids. Durable. Nice that you don't have to download any software or block anything. Slow tho!
Great to give to the little ones so they don't break my phone. Found it at a great price and used rewards to bring the price down more.
I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!
"my grandson can be beastly with his toys, but when we gave him this he settled down to ABC Mouse."
Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
This is my 2yr. olds and he loves it. He loves the different games and watching reviews.
This is very durable for a young child. It is very easy to use even for my 2 yo granddaughter.
This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
Good tablet durable lots of apps just right for 3 year old
Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it .
We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.
Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
Best tablet for my 2 year old son... it has helped a lot and seems to be the most simple kids tablet system available
I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!
"Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it."
"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
"It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it"
BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.
granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.
Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.
"I bought this for several reasons, the 2 year warranty, ease of use. My granddaughter is 21 months old and she has figured it out. Very durable, she drops it and it keeps on working"
Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."

suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion
We bought this for my Mother in Law for Mother's Day. She's not very tech but she's had no problem using.
We bought this for my Mother in law who isn't very tech savvy. She has no problems using
My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.
This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further.
"This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase."
"Bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other Fire deceased. It was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. She has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. Due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. Otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use."
"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
"Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read."
"love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone"
"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
"BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"
Easy and age appropriate. Can set timers for tv and movie watching my granddaughter finds the educational games more interesting and fun.
Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great
Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. She is able to easily use it with minimum assistance.
Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!
Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life.
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.

Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.
"Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight."
Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!!
"I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read."
I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem!
"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it
Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it
My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well
Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading
Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.
The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids
This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues
This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere.
We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.
"We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well......"
"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group."
i would buy this item again. however charging port is
still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size.
"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
"My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps"
Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear."
This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
"My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection."
"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."
Love the easy use of the system and the lots of books you can get from amazon
I purchased this tablet for a 6 yr old and it is very easy for him to use.
Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift.
Bought this as a replacement for my child's iPad. Took her a little while to learn the new OS but once she got the hang of it it was pretty easy. Lots of content and excellent at the price point.
My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!
"Easy to use, easy apps and books, you can use a timer to schedule time use"
"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
"My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift.
Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.
Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
"I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
My son loves it. Easy set up. And the best part is the case. It really is childproof. My son has dropped it and nothing had happened. Very durable. Just what my son needed.
This tablet is very kid friendly. You log on the tablet and the kids is having fun...
"it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
"not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged (me) I find it easy to work with"
This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
I observe my 4 year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease. She is able to play some of the games and upload movies. Her mom had to put a secret password for the movies because she downloaded some that you had to pay for!
Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
Purchased as a birthday gift for grandson and he LOVES it.
Great learning apps. My 3 year old won't put it down.
This tablet was bought for my 4 year old. She uses it to learn.
The tablet offered my son hours and hours of continuous learning and excitement he would not put it down until it went dead and the batteries had to be recharged
"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
"I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer."
Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games
This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.
"I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!"
I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.
Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
She loves it. She is 20 months old and already has command of it. Micky and Minnie rule it!
"I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok"
"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
Bought one before for my son and now he's brother turned 2 years and I decided to get one for him. He enjoys his tablet and battery life is good and I installed the educational app he wanted.
Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
"The idea is great, a kindle just for kids. Design just for them with pre-approved content.The price was great. I got it for $79.99 on black friday. Plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. They break it, we fix it. Is that simple.Content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.User Interface, not the best one. Amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content."
"I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."
It's easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot
"Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!!"
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders
The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy.
As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose
Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.

"Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he's 4, he loves it."
Excellent Amazon fire HD for kids. Perfect for a holiday gift
excellent for kids and safe cover so if dropped it survives
Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.
Excellent tablet! I purchased for someone in a nursing home and she loves it!
For the price this is a great investment. With amazon prime it becomes loads of fun
"I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails."
I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.
I purchased this item for my 3 year old son. It's very durable because he drops it a lot on purpose but most importantly it has a ton of educational activities for him.
I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know
"Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework"
"like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader."
My sons love playing on their tablet. Not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided.
"My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best."
Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!

the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time
Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work.
"Not only is it an excellent first tablet for a child, but it is a kindle. They can grow into it as well. And from studying up on the product before hand, I was able to determine that they have excellent customer service! That is a big plus!"
Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.
This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech.
Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire.
"Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."

We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!
This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.

It was easy to set up. My grandson has enjoyed the broad selection of activities from which to choose.
"I bought this for my grand daughter, she previously had a Nabi. I like the fact that she can use the hot spot on our phones and she can log on to view her favorite shows.My grand daughter is seven, but she also looks at movies and programs that her one year old brother can enjoy. The tablet is light enough to take along any where. It also has a protective shell which is a plus when you have an active seven year old."
"My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set
"bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied."
Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use.
"offers a lot for the price, good parental controls"
"Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver."
Definitely a good learning tool for children. Easy
"My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
"Got 2 of these for my two oldest daughters, 5 and 3. Perfect for them and love the features. Battery life seems pretty long. The year of freetime plus the case makes it worth it! Will be getting another for my 3rd daughter's 2nd birthday."
This is a great tablet for children and really has an easy to use format. The apps work well and keep the kid entertained by not distracting them with the mechanics.
For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time
I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
"I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use."
My daughter absolutely loves this! It is very user friendly. My only issue with it would be that it doesn't come with a camera automatically installed.
Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said!
"Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can't comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me."
"I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it."
Excellent gift for my grandkids. They love it and play with it all the time.
Proved to be an excellent Christmas gift for both grandkids. They love it
"This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
Easy to use and great value. Excellent viewing with good color
"Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit"
"I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also."
"Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot."
I really like the large screen. Excellent graphics
My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer
"I'm not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more."
My Grandson uses it all the time. It was a great choice!
"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip."
"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present
My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.
"I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase."
"Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things .
Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!"
the product is working perfectly and the service was greatThank you
"This is an excellent product for kids. There are lots of games, books (including interactive ones) and cartoons. I also like you can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. The only downfall is the charger cable sucks."
This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!
I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.

Great quality picture and sound for the price! Easy to navigate through menu's and app's.
This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It's very responsive and the screen resolution is great.
We bought it on a bunch and we're very pleased with the ease of use and the way our granddaughter was motivated to use it.
"My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
Bought this for my six year old grandson. The set up was very easy. He is able to download kids only stuff and can send us videos of himself using the app. He just loves it. Truly kid friendly.
"Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading...
Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
"Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended."
The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.
"great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products."
"I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet"
"I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far."
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.
The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
"This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
"Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8"" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended."
"Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot."
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.
My son loves this tablet. It is easy for him to navigate and extremely durable.
I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied.
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.
Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!
Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full
My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.
My kid loves it and is easy to use.Plus the case is worth it.
I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.
"I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too."
I am very happy with this purchase. Keeps my grandsons entertained. Easy to set up and use.
"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
"I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster."
"Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
"Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend."
With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!"
I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.
Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.
Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.
For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube
"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
"Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value."
"Upgraded from a6"" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don't think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size."
"Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo!
bought for my grand baby for christmas....haven't opened it yet but the other reviews were great!.....i'' sure he'll love it!!....
haven't opened it yet as i bought it for my grand baby for christmas!....i'm sure she'll love it!!!
"can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup."
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.
"I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating."
This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!
I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
"With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
"Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended."
Our 5 year old grandson loved it. Bought it for him to play educational games on.
"I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions."
"Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet."
"bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this."
My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
"I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!"
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.
"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon!
"My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."
First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures!
"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
"The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
"It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side."
The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.
Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
"Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life"
This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
"This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended."
We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member.
"I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
"Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books."
"seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1"
The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
"The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
"The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets."
"Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but"
"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it."
"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
"Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase."
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
Great for kids. The bumper around the tablet has saved it several times. I might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around. The programs are easy to access and love the parental controls.
My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
"The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far."
I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great
I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot.
"I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things."

"Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
She says this was the best gift she ever received.
"purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!"
It's good for toddlers. Would recommend to another parent.
Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
Easy to use grandson enjoys it .plus the two year warranty you can't beat kids can be rough on tablets.
"Great for a 2 yr old, and will use it till he's older"
I am happy that the full internet option is not available on the kids free time side. My child is 4 and has a lot of fun with this tablet.
This was just the right screen size. We were price shopping and luckily found it on sale too.
"I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!"
I did some looking in the web and after looking at many tablets this was the best choice.
"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned...."
"This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety."
Did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value.
She loves to be on the tablet all the time . So now she will have her own.
Purchased for my 5 year old. Love the echo dot sync
"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.
Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
Grandkids loved it the perfect xmas present for ages 5 to 15
Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
Bought two of these for both of my nieces birthdays and they were the hit of the party. Both love playing with them
"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained
"Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle."
It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone !
Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet!
I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
"In a field full of options, the Fire Kids Edition really comes among one of the top contenders. Great parental controls and great array of downloadable content makes this a great stepping stone into the world of tablets for kids. I see reviews that list battery life as a con, but at over six hrs. and for the price, what more do you need. I'm buying this for my four-year old and I'm not planning on her being on the tablet for six hours, let alone 8 or 9, which is what bigger tablets can handle. If you have older kids, perhaps you may want to consider a bigger, more powerful tablet. For the pre-school crowd, this is just a great tablet for both learning and entertaining."
This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.

Needs to be a way to lock screen. Kiddo loves the device for books and movies on long road trips but accidentally turns off screen or clicks out of it.
Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play.
This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets."
"Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet."
"The best device for a child in the market. Purchased for an infant and after two weeks, he is loving it. Easy to handle and durable."
It ended up being the most popular gift that she got it does a wonderful job for children
"Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it."
"My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great"
So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .

Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it
"The general use for this tablet is only worth for Amazon users mostly so unless your buy and use Amazon products, I don't recommend this to anyone else. The tablet is not excellent compared to others but it is fairly good for an affordable price."
"Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media."
"I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty."
"very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.
I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.
Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.
Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.
"This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price."
Was a gift for 7 yr old granddaughter she just loved it one of her favorite item she plays with. It goes with her almost everywhere
"Protective, fast and has tons of fun games already on it! Our 7 year old daughter likes it, too!"
"This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook"
"The kids tablet made a good gift for our youngest grandson, 6 years of age."
"This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!"
"My wife has used a Kindle Fire for years now and it was time to upgrade her. This device went on sale right before Mother's Day and I knew it was time to upgrade her 3 year old device. I picked a color and ordered and delivery to the store and pickup was just in time for the weekend. Overall, great product and great service from Best Buy for getting it to me in time."
I bought this as a gift for my smart 1 yr old niece and she loves it. she is always using the tablet. it's her favorite toy.
Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!"
"Best gift ever, now he leaves mom and dads phones/tablets alone and plays his own, which is also locked down as well. And thanks to the low price, I bought for his siblings as well, there is peace now"
"Best gift ever, now she leaves mom and dads phones/tablets alone and plays his own, which is also locked down as well. And thanks to the low price, I bought for his siblings as well, there is peace now"
My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.
We purchased this for my wife's mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading.
Bought this as a gift so I don't know much about it. Seems nice though
"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
This device will help educate Generation Glass. There are many apps and great parental controls that keep the media usage focused. Use it for educating with the Apps or entertainment. But it! Your kids will like you more.
I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
"About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good"
best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
Bought this tablet for my 2 &1/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.
good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad
Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
Great for toddlers and preschoolers. My 3 yr old loves it
Have fun with it .Good game Good apps . Easy to used
I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear.
I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.
"I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this"
I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it
I use it everyday after work for down time.........
i would not change any thing on it at all it works very good
It is an amazon amazing among many things that can be used by many people and always will be a good product to use for many people to tryout and have an important experience for their family. Amazon Kindle fire 16gb with side that has slot for the extra memory in the form of a memory chip.
It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use.
It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product..
It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks
It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab
love it great for kids my son loves it and wont put it down
Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down.
My daughter love it and is amazing thanks and I will recommend it
Nice and light. Does not have as good of battery as advertised but still very nice.
nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen
Thank..............................................
This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.

You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
"Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.
For what it does it's great for me a good alternative
My 5 year old grandson really enjoys his new tablet. He's had it for several months. The only negative I see is the charge port is starting to get loose. The small plug is maybe not robust enough for a 5 year old.
Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend
It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.
my grandson had one and likes it. so i bought it for my other grandson
"I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device."
"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.
"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.
got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him.
Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
grandson really enjoys this and plays with it all the time
Great product for surfing the internet or reading books!
I bought it for my 2 (almost 3) year old. He really lover it. I love that I can put a timer on it and he can't be on it all day. It's easy to use. The only thing I hate is how fast the battery runs down even if not in use.
I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles
Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature
I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
It isn't consumer friendly. There is difficulty navigating.
"Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot."
This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music.
Excellent quality and durability for a young child
This is a very good product my kids do homework on it
"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights
"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Installed a 64 gb micro SD and install as many apps to the card as possible to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 5 year old granddaughter."
My little girl loves this tablet. It keeps her engaged and entertained. It comes with a protective case that protects it from falls and the handlings' of kids. You can download apps and with parental control you are protected from your kids accidentally making unnecessary purchases without your knowledge. Great tablet for kids!
"Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed."
It's a good tablet for a young kid. A little hard to navigate even for adults. Cant figure out how to navigate the internet!
This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.
I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire
I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.
"Good for convenience when other devices are tied up, but the keyboard lags a little slower than I would like."
This is a kid friendly tablet good for gaming and learning games as well. Glad we got it.
"The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money."
Like that I can send and receive e-mails and do general office work and use for pleasure and research.
Setup was extremely easy. Easy for grandchild to use. Only difficulty is with parental controls stopping connection with library.
He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics
its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
Overall very good product for kid. Much robust and easy to operate.Only downside is that it is sometimes very slow.
"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that
"Good beginner tablet for kids. Could use a better resolution screen, but overall it is good."
Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
I like that you can set parental setting so the kids can't purchase without you knowing about it. Great warranty also as a separated for the kids and the parents
I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
"my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.
This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
"This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it
I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded
"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.
My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one.
My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho
"Pretty good tablet. Very durable and my son loves it, keeps him busy lots of game to choose from educational as well"
The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems
"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."
"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken."
Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.
Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.
Great graphics for price compared to other brands.
It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.
ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
"Purchased for 8 yr old daughter. It's easy for her to use and allows me to set time limits on her game, internet and streaming."
I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price."
It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
"I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!"
"Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable...."
Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
"Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
"My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!"
Good for toddlersEasy to carryEasy to download
Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could've been better if there was a mirroring capability.
"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast
A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
My son just loves it and he thinks it's easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it
For two girls that love to play games and take with them
"Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
Bought for my kid - 5 year old Kid. Worth a buy. Recommended.
I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.
"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.
"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
My mom loves this More space and functions very well!
This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier
The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.
But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.
Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
"Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps."
It's a good tablet for kids the only thing I really don't like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok
"Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with."
"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
"I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features."
Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.
"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old."
This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app.
"Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won't let you play it"
My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side.
Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps
Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
"Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great!"
"the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well.
This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.
A great watch. I bought it for the heart rate feature and it is pretty accurate.
Bought for my son for Christmas and so far he loves it good value for the price.
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas
Good product if you don't want to spend money on iPad. Great just for surfing internet.
Good product with best price available in the market place
Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile
I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
It was great product. the price which I got it was great.
My daughter loves the device. Only had it a few days
Purchased this for my Down Syndrome sister who enjoy playing games on it.
This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.
This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading
This is my third Kindle Fire. It works beautifully. The only problem I have is little details that are different from previous model. (I'm getting used to it!) As I go I'm learning.....
Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
"Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don't like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory."
"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"

Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
I enjoy the product. It was easy to program. My toddler pushed a button that changed the setting. I took the product to the store and the kind salesman corrected the product.
My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal.
Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.
Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
Bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. Wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase.
"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.
"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps
"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it"
My daughter loves it and so does my son and wife too.
So read reviews on a few tablets but honeatly felt this was the one for my kids bought it and sure enough it was it best apps for kids especially reading for kids amazon did a good deal on this and if you have prime it links up with your account for videos too
Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it
Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
"Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
"Good tablet fir children 3 and up , especially when you go on a vacation, long plane or train ride ."
Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.
"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
"Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
I definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children.
I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.
My grandkids love's it always on it great learning tool
My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.
"Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use."
performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb - Pink is a great tablet
"The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use."
The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
"This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
This is a good basic tablet. It does every thing it is advertised well. Great if your a real amazon fan.
This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal.
This is a great little kids tablet. Has a lot of features and is really fun to use.
We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.
Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!
"We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids."
If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
"I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use."
My children love it. Los of different things they can do to learn
"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games."
"Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet."
"This tablet has served it's purpose, it keeps my little one entertained with age appropriate sites and apps."
Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
"Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
"Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It's friendly and easy to use.
Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.
"Good tablet for kids, only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire"
Good tablet for kids. Easy to use and kid friendly
Good tablet for younger kids as it keeps them occupied in many ways.and great learning tool.
"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books."
"Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost"
"My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints."
"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!"
My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!
My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.
Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.
Overall good tablet for kids. My 6 and 3 year olds both enjoy it. Battery doesn't last anywhere near 7 hours though.
"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
"My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
"Got this for my wife for reading Kindle and ordering on Amazon. It is a nice unit, has quick response time and was a good value."
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
I've had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge.
This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix
this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.
Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..
This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don't want to spend more on tablets.
"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value."
"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
"Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.
So far this tablet has been efficient. It kinda bad is difficult to use and it seems to require a lot of steps to get the kids profiles set up and it actually does not do everything I hoped it would.
"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."

We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
Grandkids loved the tablets and they seem very durable and long-lasting
The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.
Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
"This is a nice basic tablet for those not wanting to spend a lot of $$. Easy to use, nice HD resolution for games and even watching Netflix etc."
Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.
"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right.
"Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa"
"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
"Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn't as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else."
I ordered the extra case not knowing the device came with a case.
Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful
For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus."
Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."
I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.
Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying.
I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?
Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down
My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad!
Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak
My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day.
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!
"Bought this for my 4 years old granddaughter and she loves it. It has all the books, apps, videos that she needs to learn and play. I love it cause she plays on it and leaves mine alone ‚ò∫. It has everything on it and I can set parental guides. Best buy ever! !"
This was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it.
I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download.
Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.
"Got this for my grand niece, she loves it. Can't beat it for the price."
Grandbaby won't put it down loves itShe's dropped it too many times & the blue cover has protected her tablet every time.
I purchased two for my grandchildren. They carry the Kindle with them everywhere they go. Great purchase!
Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience !
Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet.
Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter! She was wearing my Kindle out with ABCmouse.com! She loves it and I love the warranty
granddaughter loves it! Now my Ipad if free for ME to use
"good product for youngsters, provides learning and fun together"
They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom!
"I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile."
Purchased for the grandkids to use while they are visiting. They never seem to get bored.Tip. Make sure you have it password protected or you may find a rapid run up in charges!
Great tablet for young children. Parental locks so you can control what they see. A great deal of educational apps.
"The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe."
We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. They are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. The 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. The one con is that you don't get google play store.
"I PURCHASED TWO FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE AND THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEM, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY! I NEED TO BUY HEAD PHONES NEXT!"
My grandkids plays with this tablet all the time.lots of videos and games
BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS AGES 5-10 AND THEY LOVED IT
I love the the Kindles!! Bought this for my grandson. Impressed with the 2 years no questions asked warranty.
"alot of great free educational gaming, reasonable price only downfall is sometimes it runs a tad slower than a tablet"
I love the fact that it can take a lick and keeping on ticking my grandson is a bit rough on things.
My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him.
Bought for my 2 yr old grandson.. and he loves it has a lot of learning numbers alphabet and shapes
"This is the fourth one of these that I have purchased. My grand children love them. Between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, I don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. Excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at."
Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids
"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,"
I love the learning games that he doesn't even realize they are learning games
My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.
Grandson is enjoying this tablet very much lots of learning games to teach him plus having fun too.

Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!
Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do.
Haven't had any issues until recently my son's tablet won't charge anymore. Called geek support but they couldn't locate warranty so I'll have to go in
"he loved it was a great gift easy to use, small and great"
"Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting."

"She loves it, plays with it everyday all day. Thanks"
The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
"The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
the recipient of this gift was very happy to receive it. worked great
This is a great amazon fire tablet for kids highly recommend
This is a very responsive device for the amount paid
"This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps"
This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.

Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
Very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it
We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.
Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
"Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too"
interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.
"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
"I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product."
Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
"Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc."
"I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!"
Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
I love ordering books and reading them with the reader.
Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
"With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time."
A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids
This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books
"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.
"Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone."
"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
Price was just right.i would recommend to someone.
I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet.
"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!"
Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
"Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features."
Purchased these for our grandchildren ... great for children learning to use electronics.
It has all the features needed for my granddaughter and is easy to use. I'm am happy with this.
My 1 year old loves his tablet. He knows how to utilize it very well. It needs a better camera.
My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math.
My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I'd highly recommend this product
This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.
"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"
My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.
"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
"this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range"
Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.
The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7.
"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
"This is a Great budget table, it has has Great features for the price"
The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
Best bang for your buck............................
"Bought this for my 3 kids aged 9,7,and 2. They all use it with ease. They each have their own account with appropriate games. We like the protective cover that absorbs drops and falls well."
Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.
Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Great tablets, prefer over the Nabi anyday. Love the color choices"
"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I love that it has so much memory space, so I can download tons of games and activities to keep him occupied on long rides. I love the 2 year warranty and safety case. He loves it!"
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.
"i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics"
"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
"If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else."
it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.
"My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music."
My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.
"This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly."
"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad

"Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue."
We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing.
I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use.
I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. Great buy for the price. He loves his new tablet.
Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy!
"I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet!"
Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus
I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it!
"I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7"" for my wife that afternoon!"
I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.
"It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating."
less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!
I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.
"Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone ""barrows"" a cable."
My daughter love it she don't really brother me it keep her so busy
Great camera for a beginner very easy to understand
My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
My daughter has enjoyed it very much!!!! She loves using the camera. And playing the games she just loves it. We have to put it on charge and she is asking 5 minutes later is it charged yet!!!! Really is kid friendly
The grandson likes the learning games that are on the tablet. You can see the progress in his learning from the time he has used it
"Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too."
They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps.
All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!

"We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!"
"Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it."
We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
My 3yr old just loves it keeps her occupied for hours
Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet
"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point.
Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world.
Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.
"This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered."
I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
"Better then a E-book, more options and versatility"
Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down
"Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break."
Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews.
I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
"My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it."
"The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you."
This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
"This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!"
This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has
"This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc"
I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks
Device size and speed are more than adequate for an 8 year old. I love Freetime and the ability to set limits for weekdays and weekends so my grandson is able to play without my direct supervision. Apps and books are age appropriate. I may have to buy 2 more for the 4 year olds.
"My children loved it, and it is great learning tool."
I like it so and so my kids like it very much.The application is amazing.
"I love it for my kids, they r enjoying playing games and watching kids cartoon."
"I love it so and so my kids.They r enjoying playing the educational games, and watching cartoons."
I loved it. I purchased it for my daughter. We got a free year subscription which came with a lot of apps to keep her engaged.
"My kids like it, and the application is amazing.I recommend it for all kids"
"I bought this device recently for my daughter, she likes it very much. She learning new things. I also gifted this device to my friends Son."
"Setting up the device for my sons profile took a litthe more time than I expected, but I love it. It's easy to navigate and has a ton of preloaded activities for him."
"Bought 3 for my young grandkids exceptional security for kids, great babysitter as well as educational tool"
"I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase."
This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
This device provides necessary app and is extremely user friendly.
"Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload."
"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
"Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend"
I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.
"We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. The kids love it and it is simple to use. The ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. We can switch to our profile to watch Netflix or use other apps if we want. Comes with a great warranty and device protector. We're very happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet."
My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more!
Really great item for the kids and very user friendly
Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it.
This kindle is very convenient and has a great display that's easy on the eyes.
"This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
"Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable."
Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
"the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended"
Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy
Great way to get kids introduced to using a tablet. A ton of free software is available. Guarantee seals the deal.
"If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!"
I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.
"This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to."
This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.
"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
"I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!"
"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do.
My kids have gone through several Amazon Tablets and this one is by-far the best one I have seen.
Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.
"We purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play games and read books without having to use her mom's devices. She took to it immediately. It connects easily to a 2.4 ghz network but does not support connectivity to a 5; search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it was the Fire or the network, then again, it was running updates. The camera takes great pictures even if a child is a bit shakey... Sound quality is very good as is touch sensitivity."
"Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks"
Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.
My son loves his tablet!!no matter how many tapes he drops it its still works great!very satisfied with my purchase.
My granddaughter LOVES it! LOTS of kid-friendly apps for a 5 year old!
This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!
Everything he needs but nothing more. The case looked a little flimsy but it has been great so far.
"This watch is not only very useful, it's very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the ""smartwatch"" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least."
Easy for 3 year old to navigate. Like the adult to kid use.
"Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day."
"Santa brought this to our daughter, she's 7 and it's perfect for her!! Easy to use and figure out!"
This tablet is for our 9 year old grandson. It works out great for him to play games on.
"I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that."
"Great tablet for a little kid. I was debating between this and an ipad but figured an ipad would be way too much for a tablet. Its nice because you can switch users. If you want something simple , then this is the one for you."
"I got this for ky 3 year old and she loves it. She has dropped it a fews times, once outside and it just bounced. I also love that I can set restrictions on play time, I can have it where this is no play time until a certain number of minutes of reading time has been completed. I don't have set times of the day that she can even get on it"
"Very easy for my child to navigate. It was very easy to set it up. All the games, books and internet that's pre-loaded is awesome and so convenient"
"Love the parental controls and more storage than previous models, but still seems to run out."
My granddaughter loves it and she's learning a lot
"I bought this for my 6yr-old & am impressed w/the 1yr subscription to free-time that was included, and the additional 2yr manufacturer warranty. The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!"
"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!"
I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too.
Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. She loves the number of books she is able to access. It wasd a Christmas hit!
My eight year old loves the games and it is safe for her to use.
It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on
Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
Perfect for price and purpose. I bought this for my 19 month old granddaughter to watch videos and listen to songs on instead of using parents iPhone. When she is older she will be able to play games. Perfect size for her to hold. Love guarantee
we brought this tablet for our 6 yr old for Xmas and she loves it!. it was the go to tablet as she was always playing on my fire tablet... recommend for kids
Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.
"Easy to use, handle and screen is perfect for a toddler."
Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
Very durable and easy to use. Last for several years with all that it can do.
"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year."
"Thought this would be too advanced for my 3 year old, but she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and learn patience. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept her honest."
"Thought this would be too bland for an 8 year old, but he loves it. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept him honest."
"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year."
"I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned."
This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.
Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in
I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps
My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it.
This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!
I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
My 5 year old loves it! She can order books and look at all her favorite shows
I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!
"I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch"
Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one.
"Bought for grandson ,he loves it's! He uses it daily after home work done."
Extremely satisfied with the value and performance of the Fire kids edition; highly recommend for age 5 and up.
I bought this for my daughter. I like that there are security features. She enjoys it and I have peace of mind!!
My daughter absolutely love her tablet and I love it to for her. It's very kids friendly
My daughter loves it it's very easy to navigate and it is practically indestructible
My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money
My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available.
I have purchased 3 of these tables still have them just handed them down one grandchild to the next will need another next year. They are tough the heavy rubber case really keeps them safe. Good product!
It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!
As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.
Small enough for a purse and works great. I would recommend memory card.
We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents.
"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
"I bought this for my sister after her child stepped on her laptop and broke the screen! She is in love with it - it's just the right size for her to do her photo editing, surf the web, watch videos, etc. It's quite durable as well - seeing as how a four-year-old has his hands on it quite often :)The only thing that could be improved is the camera quality - but we didn't buy it to take pictures with. Just to edit them!"
I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.
"So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this."
"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."
We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 6 year old. He loves it. It's durable and reliable.
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it‚Äôs great for entertainment."
I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!

Easy setup...bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5...they love it
"Excellent for kids! Tons of fun apps, videos and books. Love that it comes with a year of Free Time."
"For the price you can't beat this tablet for kids. I'm not a fan of Amazon's super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can't access the tablet without your permission."
Gave to my great nephew. 2.5 yrs old. He loves it and his father no longer has to turn over his phone to his son.
Got it for our grandson for Christmas and he won't put it down. Comes with free kids software which is great.
"Got this for my son, he loves it and is easy to use and add stuff for kids, the warranty is an added bonus. Plus pretty durable, since having a 2 year old, when he throws fits, this gets thrown as well."

Is great for beginners I love the parental control on it it works great for my toddler.
It's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child's tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.

my 2 almost 3 year old son for Christmas it is great even for adults as well very sturdy and holds but to a wild 2 year old

My son can break anything and this product truly holds up to children's use."
I got this for my one and two year old girls and I don't have any complaints! The battery life isn't great but I don't really mind that!
I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
"My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"
My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!
"My son is constantly distracted and loves technology. Him being only two years old, this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble."
"Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now."
This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.
"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."
"Fire kids edition, I love it, because kid just can find movies and games especially for them, I don't have to be worry about Reader ""r"" movies that accidentally they can watch"
"lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!"
I have a four year old daughter who has learned a lot from using this tablet. The child feature is great because she can access everything for her age in one area ( with parental settings of course). I really love this tablet
I am so glad I got my son (5 1/2 years old) the Fire Kids Edition Tablet! It is extremely durable & provides hours of educational entertaining fun!!!
I got this for my two grandsons (ages 2 & 4) for Christmas. They love them.

Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web
Bought it for my 8 year old and it was perfect. She loves it and works it with ease.
Loved this. Bought it for my 5 year old. Can't wait.
The product is easy for grandson to operate and navigate through and seems to be very durable
"this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids."
My four year is very tech savvy better than some adults!Great for shaping her real world experiences.
Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on.
"I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials."
Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.
Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there.
My grand daughter loved it. She plays with it all the time.
Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
"My 4 yr old is fully capable of navigating to her favorite games, videos, photos, etc. I like the bumper case too. It has proved its worth already."
She has dropped it a few times and the case is just great
"Was thinking of getting my 5 year old her own Ipad or the kindle. I'm so glad that I picked the kindle, it comes with a kids version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate games, movies, and apps, even though she can't read yet. She loves it too!"
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it
"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"
I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no ""accidental"" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts."
Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it.
"Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day"
My daughter who is two loves it. She colors and dose puzzles
Got this for my 4 year old. Seems like a great tablet for a young kid to use. I'll edit this after Christmas when I give it to her.
Highly impressed with my purchase. Allows me to use my iPad again since my 3 years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet. Great support and numerous educational apps for children!
My grandkids love it. They use it at home and when we travel.
My grandkids love to use it. It has so much for them to choose and they learn too.
Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account
Great for my kids. Syncs to all of our Amazon videos and netflix. The protective kids case is a must. Makes it easier for smaller kids to hold without touching the screen. Also does well with drops to the ground
The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also.
Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
This product is a great learning tool for my 4yr old toddler. It's has the option for kid mode or regular tablet mode.
Great tablet for my son. Kid applications are very useful in his learning.
This is really very comfortable and easy as well as strong for toddler my baby really enjoy using this amazon fire kids
Got this tablet for my mom who isn't very tech savvy. She loves it. Can't beat the price
This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle
This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!
"We are super happy with the kindle fire. We had bought several DVD players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. Now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read. It also doubles as a tablet for me since it gives the options for different profiles. We love it!"
"I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music."
"My 4 year old loves it. Easy to function and pretty tough, it has been dropped a few times and did not crack or break."
"Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better."
This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.
"Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size"
The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good.
also great for listening to music and also for movies
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE
"Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!"
"I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd."
Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it.
Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.
So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book
This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies!
This is the best thing for reading specially on the go.
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me

"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse"
"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need"
Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality.
"Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go!"
Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
As long as apps are downloaded before leaving WIFI they work great for road trips or hunting trips!
Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great!
I am totally happy with this product for my two year old grandson..he enjoys it when we are all playing on our phones
Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive
Good for smaller kids that cannot play or get to play on Xbox games with 7 other Siblings
Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well
Great for smaller kids who are Too young to play or get a turn to play on Xbox games with 7 siblings
My daughter loves it keeps the kids occupied. I would recommend to anyone with kids
Got one for my 4yr old. She loves it. It's very durable. I love that I can switch accounts and use it for myself too.
I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel.
"This is our 4th kindle and we love them as ""beginner"" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue!"
This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet.
"Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved ."
"Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available."
Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone whit kids
I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids
Great for the kids. Sometimes have issues with the charging mechanism.
Great tablet for the kids as it includes some good educational apps and has a good case that surrounds it for durability.
My son loves his own kindle! Very kid friendly and easy for him to use. It is great that he now has his own!
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.
Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good.
"great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either"
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
"I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
"The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
"Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week."
Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!
Purchased for toddler to watch movies and stuff. He loves the apps that are available.
"Bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves it. The case makes it so much easier for little hands to hold. He's dropped it a few times and it's pretty solid, no scratches!"
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
Just purchased as a Christmas gift for my glambaby & she loves it !!!! Very nice case for little clumsy & at times rough hands!!!
My son is 22 months and he love it. He watches his favorite shows.
"Perfect..grandson, age 16 months, just loves it! No worries if dropped."
Very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use.
We purchased this kindle for our 3 yr old since it was lightweight and easy to use. If he would only let one of figure out apps and other functions. So the parental setting are great but havent gotten much further than that
"Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc."

perfect for plane rides. the product operates as promised
This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.
It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.
Love the no glare feature. Perfect for outdoors. This is light weight and will be great for travel.
"I've had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick."
Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email.
Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.
"When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!"

"I needed something that's not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it's not iPad, but it's good for a tablet)"
It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet
Absolutely love Kindle Kids Edition. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids.
"Bought this for my four year old nephew and he loves it! He has dropped it several times, because of the hard shell case nothing happened. He is able to manipulate all educational games and has no problem with any operations."
My nephew always uses my sister's iphone when watching videos. He loves his youtube videos lol. So I went out and bought him this. The kid loves it. There's value in the cartoon membership also
This tablet has been great for my three year old. Only complaint is that you can't turn off the app download function on free time or see a complete list of what has been downloaded.
"As an existing Amazon Prime member, this is a no brainer. Has all the parental controls and kids can have a decent tablet that is durable for use, at a good price."
It's a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level.
My 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. She is really catching on to using technology . She loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.
"Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me."
My son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and I can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc.. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.
"Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read."
The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.
"Durable case, easy to use. My grandkids watch nursery rhymes and play educational games. I've seen the youngest stand on the Fire and it is still perfect"
"My two daughters really enjoy using their Fire tablet. It is really easy to use, sturdy, high definition, has tons of awesome apps integrated for children. My girls were Apple users, yet it was easy to transition."
This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.
"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
Small and easy to use for children when traveling.
I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.

i actually purchased for a friends daughter and she is very happy
"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
This tablet is the best for kids. Switching from kids to adult is awesome! Works perfect and has lots and lots of apps for kids
My three year old son love it. He can read and learn so much from the free time app.
my son loves his kindle kids edition he doesnt go anywhere without it.excellent quality
My kids love their tablets. They play games and take pictures.
Great tablet for a toddler to start on! The parental controls can be fiddled with a little bit but good anyways!
This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
"Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features."
A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use!
"A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT!"
"I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!"
My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life
My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet.
Our grand daughter is very happy with her fire kids edition. Product wotks great.

The kid really love this kindle fire. The protection for the kindle help protect the kindle
I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money
I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.
Wonderful tablet for the kids. It comes in nice colors and has so many nice features.
Got as a gift for my mom for Mother's Day . Really great
I hope that Azi will like to have her own entertainment instead of playing games on the cell phone.
"They both love it! And, play or read all they can."
I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.
"Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free ""May Day"" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time."
Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!
I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.
I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.
Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family.
"I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it!"
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!

Awseome tablet for kids. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.

Needed something for Christmas for five year old grandaughter. This hit the spot.

"I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!!"
Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
"This 8"" tablet is much better than the older 7"" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version."
I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.
"Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again."
I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.

"Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."
"This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size."
This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend
This is a great inexpensive tablet for beginners. It also has access to Amazon Prime's Library for Music and Video. I would highly recommend it.
"Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get."
Works as well as any of the other more expensive tablets. Resolution is great and size is practical.
I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed.
Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase."
"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
Grand daughter is two years old and watches her older brother and sister use their iPads. So we got her the Amazon Fire Kids Addition and she loves it. She has a great time with learning numbers and the alphabet.
"Bought this for a Christmas Gift, the item is great"
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!

Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one.
This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small.
Great gift for the price. Brought for 2 year old grandson.
This is a very good tablet for kids to use. You can set up time them to play game and time to read!
Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.
This is a very good tablet for kids to use. You can set up time them to play game and time to read!
"I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos"
"I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos"
Very easy for a child to be able to use and enjoy.
In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price
I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!!
"¬†I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it."
I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.
My nephew love it. He uses it every day thank you.
"So we gave it to my 1yr old for christmas, on the box it says if you break any way theyll replace, 30sec after opening he throws it down and jumps on .... works great lol loves watching spongbob on lol"
This has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed.
This tablet has grt performance and good camera and long backup. 2 year warranty make lifw more easy for parent's.
"My 3 year old is learning so much playing the games on this tablet, and I love that it is so durable and can take a beating. Would recommend. Many games to match many age groups. Plus YouTube access."
"purchased this tablet for my 2 year old and she loves it. the case is doin an amazing job with keeping the tablet good as new. the preinstalled apps are amazing and she loves them, so do I! Programs, apps, etc are all very easy for her to navigate"
What impressed me the most was the amount of free kids apps that you get with the Kindle. These are easy to use in both size and software.
"I've bought 2 of these for my nephew and niece. They have great parental controls, wifi capable, plenty of space and you can switch out of kids mode if an adult wants to use it."
Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it.
"Bought this for our grandson, we originally had the Nabi Dreamtab, (by the way I have purchased 3 of them !!) This definitely beats that by a long shot. Very good tablet for kids !!"
Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet
Great for learning apps and surfing internet for my 7 year old kid and also good protection
Great tablet for my kiddos they love these kindle fire kid tablets and they are very strong hold up to a lot. Price is great too.
I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7yr old granddaughter and it's very easy for her to use.
"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful."
"I bought this tablet for my 5-year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. It's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games."
I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
"I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"
I needed something for a young kid and this tablet was suggested to me from a sales person at Best Buy. The kid loves it.
"I've purchased other kids tablets, but this is the best. It's user friendly and interactive. My grandson carries it with him where ever he goes."
It is a great starter tablet for young kids. My son really enjoyed it.
love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price"
My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was
"My kids loved it, they were able to learn how to use it right away"
My kids really enjoyed this tablet. Its kid friendly...
Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.
This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.
"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer.
Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her.
Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it
"I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate."
I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!
I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3.
Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family
Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane
"This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter."
This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.
"Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone."
I love it. It is just as they said. Kindle fire hd.
I'm loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more.
"The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it"
I like the fact that there is parental control plus by putting your child's age the kindle will only send you games that are designed for your child's age
Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person
My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!
if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside .
Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.
I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.
I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing 1 for another grandchild in October. They love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them.
Awesome for kidsIt's educationalI love the blue cover!!!
I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
my granddaughter has learned a lot of educational things on hers
This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.
Works better than what I thought! Keeps the kids entertained for hours at the same time they are learning.
"It's perfect, my granddaughter loves it!! She's catching on so fast and learning so much!! Easy for travel and on the go"
"Easy to use, love the color and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up very happy with my purchase."
Great list of available apps. Most apps need wifi to function
"Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv."
Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.
"No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well."
It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.
"Bought this for my 4yo daughter for Christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. It survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the USB power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. However this is where Amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for Amazon to replace if damaged. I called customer service, they took my info and I had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!"
Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities.
"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
"I purchased this for my youngest grandson, age 4 for christmas and he will be receiving it shortly. Games have been downloaded and it will be charged and ready to use when he opens his gift."
"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !
Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.
Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size.
This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.
"This was purchased for my older grandson, age 6, for Christmas and as I stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him."
Great unit my neice can use when traveling to watch videos and take photos.
I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed.
very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality
Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use.
I love this this memory card. The price was good ty
"The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank."
"Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media."
"Bought this for my aunt for Christmas. She had wanted a book reader. But then she decided she wanted something she could ""play games on."" She's very happy with it!"
has good download speed. great color and clarity. sound also very good
Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer
"I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it."
This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.
Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.
"Bought it for my wifes Yoga Training Course.So much cheaper than buying all the paperback books she needed, and she loves it!Cheaper books, music, emails.. What more do you need?"
The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
My grandson used my old I Phone to play on. Got him this tablet and he loves it! Great deal!
Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break
Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers.
This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase
"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
This device completely meets my needs for reading and accessibility.
"I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student."
I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price
I love how easy the parental controls are and how easy it is for me to go back forth between my kindle page and to my sons
I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone.
I would buy another one for the priceGood product
Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful
My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .
Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price
"Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price"
This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one
"This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault."
"Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap."
Cannot beat the value and features that this product offers for the low price point.
Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture
I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great.
I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price.
I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!!
Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places.
The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it.
"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."

You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
"Tons of value, if you want a budget tablet look no further."
"I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!"
Love everything about this television. Quality is great!Price is great!Happy all around!
Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome!
"2nd kindle bought as a gift. Easy to operate, can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional books."
Always a good price and good for what it's meant for.
Bought for my 3 year old and she loves it! Haven't had any issues!
Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it!
Bought this item for my 1 yr old and at first would not pay attention to it since he loves to run around. But when we are out its a good tablet for a kid and very durable since kids tend to drop toys. We use it to watch movies and even kid educational apps. It's a good buy for the price and to entertain the kids. Video quality is very good.
Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features
Easy for kids to use. Keeps them entertained for hours. Love it!
easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS
Excellent product for the price. Would recommend to anyone.
Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price
"Got this for my 7 year old daughter, she loves it. We read on it, she plays on it, there are videos on it, and she can't or hasn't found a way to break it yet. Well done Amazon, well done."
great for the kids and protection is good ! and best buy is making me write more stuff here so that people can go ahead and buy this product...
Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.
Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use
Great product easy to set up and use my child loves it
Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.
Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased.
I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.

I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you
I bought 1 a year ago for our oldest kid. Came back this year and bought two more. Built really well. This is the best choice for a kids tablet.
"I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. Her only disappointment is that she is unable to access the ""Musicality"" app."
I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they
I love it! Perfect size to carry with me in my purse.
I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games.
I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do
I purchased for my 7 yr old grandson to use for playing games. He is very happy with it. It appears to be a good buy .
I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great.
"I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price"
I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
"I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed."
It was the best Christmas Present for my grandson.
Keeps the kids busy with games and activities and they really like it
Kids love playing with it. We use it for netflix and for basic games
LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN
Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!!
My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!
My daughter is going to love this for christmas!!! Thanks best buy.
"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip.
My granddaughter loves this and it came as promised.
My grandson loves it and there are lots of educational games .
My kids loved and i very happy for this tablet. Thanks
Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.
Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment.
So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price!
So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips
The reader was easy to setup for a novice reader and email user.
The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times
This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price.
This product is very user friendly and it is very lightweight
This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.
This was bought as a replacement for my wife's previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera.
Turns out the Fire is much better than I expected. Well worth the $50 I paid for it!
User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can't complain.
Very happy with my new tablet. Everything is assessible and easy to find. Great pic quality. My 10 year old loves it and has taken ownership of it which shows how easy it is to use.
Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won't stop playing it
We love the free time feature. Definitely going to end up subscribing after the free year trial is up. Our 2 year old loves it and we can control how long she's on it.
Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product
This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books.
"Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service"
Great product and great service from bestbuy online
i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.
"Purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since I notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing."
This was a gift for my granddaughter and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps her occupied for hours. It is also kid-proof!
"The 8 inch Fire is s great reader, 5 star. The only down side are limited add on applications."
Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don't use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too.
This was my second e reader and I love it easy to operate along with a lot of apps available.
My 4 year old daughter loves her fire for kids. Keeps her very entertained at all times
Can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win.
I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.
The only complaint is that you get a year free of Amazon free time but after that first year you start getting charged till you cancel.
eady enough for my 3 year old to use by herself. Can turn it on and choose her app. Comes with s protective case. Great product for kids to learn on.
got this product for my granddaughter. im #1 grandma now
This is for my 5 year old and she hasn't put it down since Christmas. She uses it for watching videos and taking pictures of her toys..
The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.
This tablet is great for kids. I bought it for my Grandson and he is delighted with it. He uses it constantly.
Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun
This was a gift for my toddler grandson. He loves it.
Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop.
Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use
Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay
For the money this tablet has a great display and allows you to do pretty much the same that lots of other more expensive devices are capable of.
"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page."
This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life.
We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.
Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse.
Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised.
Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend.
"Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase."
Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.
"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there."
Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!!
Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage.
"My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use."
Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.
This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!
After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this.
Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school
Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can't believe it so inexpensive!
Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer.
This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.
I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.
Good age appropriate learning tool for kids. There is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored. Overall a good tablet for the kids.
Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy!
I have always been an iPad user but I love the kindle fire 8. It has everything you need and more and so much less expensive.
My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!
We recently purchased this as a gift for charity. We chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and couldn't be more please. It's very easy set up and super user friendly. I would def. recommend this for a child rather than a more expensive product.
We recently purchased this exact tablet for our daughter who is 2 years old and decided to purchase this tablet for a charitable gift at Christmas. I would recommend this rather than more expensive tablet options for a child. it is worth the money and very user friendly.
"My wife and I bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help keep her entertained during car rides, etc.. well now she is completed addicted to it. I guess like many kids get addicted to their electronics. We just set limits to how often and when she can use it. There are also educational games and apps you can down load that help them to learn and prepare for school. My daughter loves playing these games also. Overall a great purchase."
Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them!
great value for the pricing...black friday special

Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features.

I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase.
It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy
"Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry."
"The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books."
"This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one."
I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader.

This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel
Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value
I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.
My mom was looking for a affordable tablet. I bought mine at best buy last November. I recommended the fire tablet and she loves it.
So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.
"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places."
"It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want."
"Can't beat for price,feels expensive but isn't. Does all the basics"
This is the third kindle i have purchased they ate easy to operate
I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.
my son loves it. I have bought him tablets before but he never liked them as much. this one is easier to use.
I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it.
"nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs."
I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it.
"Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality."
So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life.
Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on.
Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.
"Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.."
Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive.
"Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8"" tablet HD"
I feel that this tablet was the perfect fit for my boys age 8 and 6.
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate.
My granddaughter is enjoying it thoroughly. My son likes the various parental controls
"Great starter to teach young children how to play games with parental control of what game,movie or music sites. And the plastic protector case is included"
Got this for my 3 yo and he is enjoying it. The case is worth it's price in gold.
Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.
Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need.
"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
We purchased this for our 3 year grandson for Christmas and he just fell in love with it. Great learning tool to start kids off with!
"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."
"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device."
Gift for our son and he is really enjoying it. He can read as well as play games.
My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use.
Love the safety features for parents to protect their little ones from some content on the Internet. Love preloaded programs
Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading.
Being used to an Ipad this is difficult to adust to but does the job just fine for a low price - good size to carry around without weighing down your purse. Would buy again

A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else.

For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal
For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn't buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself.
"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in."
For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I've never had an iPad to compare it to but that's only because I've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet.

Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids

Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages.
Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.
Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead.
"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it."
Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend.
"Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies."

"Have a 7"", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great."
I already own one but bought another for my sister in law for Christmas.
I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation.

I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It's way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven't had any problems with it. Well worth your money
I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.
I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it
"I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase."

I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire.

Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.
"I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great."

Not a huge fan of products that aren't Apple but this one is good. Haven't had any problems with them at all.
One of the best tablets on the market for its value
Only wish games worked without internet once downloaded
Perfect for face timing with family. Perfect for travel.

"The 8"" version is much better than the older 7"" version. Better graphics and faster processor"
"The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8"" tablet is just the right size."
The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.
The kids love it and are always on it. Would recommend to anyone.
"The Kindle/Amazon Fire HD Tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything I want from a tablet. Easy to use, easy to read and easy to pay for. A great tablet"
The Kindles were good while they worked 3 days!! Best Buy was good about replacing them. Very frustrating though to have to get them replaced when my kids only played on them for three days.
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn't stand up - hate it
"The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable."
They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro
This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.
This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members.
This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.
This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price.
"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful."
This is one of the best kids tablets I have purchased. It's not as restricted and complicated to operate as other tablets I have tested.
"This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing."
This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)"
"This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I'd recommend for people who love to read."
This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase
this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I'm aiming at! Easy to use and can't beat the price.
This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling.
"This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8"" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop."
"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100"
Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.
Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it's HD and user friendly.
Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice
We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great.
"We have dropped it a few times and the case is great. There is a ton of memory, great price. And how did I never know about Amazon underground. It's a great product and great price. I definitely recommend"
We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends
"We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better."
"Works great for my daughter, great price and apps."
"works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos"
"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle"
"Works well my little loves it,battery life great.."
You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
"Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity."
I gave a 5 star review because its a great tablet for a child with disabilities
"I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I've enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas."
Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price!
"I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for."
"I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8"" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too."
"Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot."
This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.
The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.
Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow.
Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
I liked it so much I will e getting all my grandkids one for birthdays from now on.
We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.
I'm very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it.
"My granddaughter had been using her parents' iPad and loves using apps for learning. I thought it would be nice for her to have her own tablet. My daughter loves the parental limits that can be set and my granddaughter loves not having to ""share"" with her parents!"
It is awesome and my grandboy loves it. It keeps him from playing with my phone.
I absolutely love the parental controls on this device. You can even set a time limit on how long they can use it.
Bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality. The case protects it well.
I bought this product for my 4 year old grandaughter and she loves using it
"We bought this for our 7 year old and at first we had some issues loading things, but things seem to be working great now. He loves it and he can play games and load apps. Just what we wanted it for."
This tablet was for my great-grandson and he loved it
He loves his kindle takes it everywhere. does school work on it plus plays games Excellent piece of equipment.
I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skills in counting and reading in English and foreign languages. She also enjoys having the tablet to read stories to her as it lights up the words for her to read along. She loves the ability to watch her favorite programs as well. This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase.
I love this tablet i got it for my grandson and the minute he comes through the door he wants his tablet it keeps him busy
It has been a great product for our son. Easy to use and excellent for learning and playing games. Video quality is very good as well.
"We purchased this for our son who starts school next year. This is a great upgrade from his Nabi. My only complaint would be the memory, or lack there of. It is expandable so I highly recommend a micro SD."
This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.
My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe
This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.
This met my expectations and more. My granddaughter loves it. It's user friendly and has unlimited options for her. Would recommend to everyone!
It's an excellent learning tablet for a child. I would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.
My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.
My husband and I purchased 3 of these for each of our kiddos and to say they're a hit would be a massive understatement. And the parental controls on these are awesome. We love our new Fires!!
Got this for my Grandson's birthday. He really wanted a tablet and I wanted something that wasn't so breakable. He was so excited and he loves it
This is a great tablet for a kid! It is easy to use and play on!
My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven't used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice.
Bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it! The child case is awesome too in case of any drops.
Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price.
"Love this tablet! Highly recommended, especially for a toddler who's learning. Has lots of games and activities for learning, parental controls, which I find extremely necessary for the internet today!"
"My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this ""big game"" as he calls it."
The tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. She is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. I like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps.
Very pleased with product. I was also a decent price and not overpriced.
We bought this for our 2 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! It has so many apps and videos for her to watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child.
I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.
Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content.
"I would recommend this to all of our friends and family. It's worth every penny. Good warranty, comes with a free subscription, works quickly and is very durable!"
Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature
"We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa."
This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.
"Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy."
"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!
"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it."
This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is.
my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the books for school & screen size is prefect
My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old.
Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all.
"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!"
Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well
"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!"
Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.
This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.
Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again.
Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. She would use her Mom's phone to watch her shows but now that she has her tablet she can watch her own and see it much better. Homerun on this Christmas present!
Easy to maneuver. And great case for protection. The battery does not keep a charge long but I'm used to the iPad.
"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube."
"I purchased two of these tablets, one for my niece, one for my nephew, as they are often fighting over the tablet. It is a great platform, with awesome apps, and comes equipped with a very sturdy and rugged case. Five stars. Worth every penny."
It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.
My 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it's great
"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made ."
My brother told me about this product. I bought it for my son and he loves it.
Nice product . Love the fact that my 5 years sons are gaining computer experiance.
we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them these are the best tablets on the market they have great learning apps on them aswell
"What I really like is that you can set up different profiles( boy,girl and myself ) and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile.I bought 2 and kids are very happy."
Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it.
Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom. I thought I saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if I find this to be true. Would hate to be charged for what the kindle was intended for.
It's such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I'm glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday
My 5 and 8 year olds love these tablets. They are able to play age appropriate content. Tablet seems well powered and the case is providing good protection.
"I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen's not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can't be beat."
"Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy"
My daughter loves the games/videos that she can watch on it during the day and my wife uses it to read on during the evening. This thing gets used a lot! Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price
Bought one last year that worked out well. Decided to get another one this year. Very pleased.
Excellent tablet for my grandkids. Durable. Awsome 2 year free replacement if damaged for any reason
Keeps my granddaughter busy. She was showing me how to use it. Now she doesn't want to use mine.
I bought this tablet for my son and he enjoys using it the only thing I don't love is that u need internet to use most apps on it and you cant download youtube kids. It has a lot of apps though and a lot of learning material for all ages.
Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!
"Bought this for my Granddaughter, she absolutely loves it!"
"Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use"
Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.
Easy to use for a 5 year old. She loves it. I just don't like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet.
"For the price you really can't beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can't be beat!"
Got this for my kid. Great cheap tablet. Camera aren't so good but usable. Apps load quick.
"Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it"
Great for my 7 year old she loves it!!! Great price and great product!!!
Great for my four year old. She is able to access all her learning games with ease.
"Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps."
Great tablet for kids my boys love their tablets!!
"great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value."
"Great tablet, kids love it and have their own. Easy to use"
Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.
Holds charge well. Portable. Lightweight and as best we can tell nearly indestructible. Perfect for kids
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 4YR OLD. WE HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET AS IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. FROM WHAT I READ THIS WILL DO THE JOB FOR HIM. THE PRICE AND COLOR WAS GREAT.
I bought this product for my grandchildren. It is very easy for them to use and sturdy enough not to break when they drop it.
I bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them. I would recommend.
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view.
I love this tablet for kids .. it's so much fun for them .. great buy ...
"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid."
I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn't work any more.
"I really love this tablet for my toddler! The only things I have against it are that there is no kickstand on it, it may lag at times, and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie can't be exited. Other than that it's a great tablet."
It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
It's a great beginner tablet for kids allows you to ensure your kids are viewing and playing contents for their age.
It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.
My 3yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet! Now she can watch Mickey Clubhouse whenever she wants.
My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books
My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.
"My daughter love her tablet. And is easy to use, and the battery last longer.."
My granddaughter loves her pink tablet she is four and able to use on her own
My grandson who is 5 years old is enjoying this tablet. Very friendly to use.
My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn't have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet.
My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight
My son absolutely loves this tablet. He has dropped it a lot and hasn't cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two years for free. I also like the prime account for the kids to be able to play whatever apps for free
My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.
Our 4 grand kids use these daily charge after charge sometimes .youngest is almost 3 oldest is 9 Just watch the charging cable connection easily broken if charging while using
Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes!
Purchased for a 5 year old. Perfect for kids and as a first tablet.
Purchased this as a gift for our niece and she loved it. Very easy for her to use and add apps too. Fits well in her hands and she loves the color. Recommend
"Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app."
Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!
This is a good tablet for kids and comes with a good warranty
"This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things. My husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. I had no problems getting it replaced."
This is a great tablet for kids. Its got great parental controls and its easy for the kids to use. I even enjoy playing angry birds on it
This is a great tablet for kids. Very durable and easy to use.
This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we've made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice!
"very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos."
"We bought the kindle fire to replace a broken iPad 2, which was now out of date for any further updates. I love the parental controls. The case has been a savior for a few drops. My daughter loves the size of the tablet. The 2 year replacement plan and 1 year unlimited FreeSpace makes this the perfect tablet for my child. She loves that she doesn't have to ask everytime she wants a new game or video. We chose to expand the memory up to 128gb with a microsd and so no worries about running out of storage space! My only complaint is that the battery life isn't anywhere near the power of an iPad. So keep your charger with you!"
We decided to buy the tablet so our toddler could play educational games on hers instead of going for my iPad. I love how we can block her from going on the Internet as well as set a curfew. It's easy to use and my daughter loves it!
We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time!
"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro SD card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson."
got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied
Kindle Fire meets the needs of kids and/or adults-
The Amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages . Ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire.
"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
Bought one of these for each of my grandkids and they love it!
"I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!"
"I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue. They was for my 5 and 7 years children. They really love their tablets. Yes, it was a birthday gift."
Love this tablet! It's easy to setup and the pre-loaded games were a hit with my little one! Very pleased with the the selection of videos and games on Amazon Kid Play :)
"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!"
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Love the fact that it has a two year warranty against breakage and also comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time.
We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.
"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. It's easy to use and the perfect size for his hands.
My daughter loves it. So easy to set up. And keeps everything age appropriate.
This kids fire tablet is perfect for our 5 year old granddaughter. We downloaded some free and purchase kids apps. It give us a break as she's not always asking for our tablet. And we know the content on it is safe.
This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.
"Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love!"
"This is the second tablet I've purchased aimed for little ones and it's by far the best. Easy to access his games and plenty of preloaded games, videos and apps. It makes road trips so much happier!"
"Perfect if you're looking for the basic necessities of a laptop. Only negatives no yahoo apps, no google apps, no apple app, but it's still awesome."
I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.
The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person!
My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid!
Has worked out well. Very user friendly. Would buy again. Great price as well.
I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden
Great tablet for my three year old son It's really easy for him to use
My daughter like her tablet it's so simple to use.
"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint."
Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.
Easy to navigate. Color is good. Duarable. My son has had many fun hours playing with it
"Love the case, table works very well, easy to download game and apps, but the life of the battery is not great. The battery fully charged only last about 3-4 hours"
"Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe."
I like that this tablet can grow with my 5 year old. I love the various age settings and the parental controls. Perfect first tablet!
Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn't be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store.
Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers.
"I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself."
I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features!
Easy to use and teach my granddaughter not easily breakable
"This is a great tablet for my 3 year old grandson. The cover is great in that, if he drops it, it won't break! Great buy"
I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!
My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes.
It's a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons
This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality
"Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games"
Tablet is great! I bought it for my 6 year old daughter again (first one finally got the screen cracked) for Christmas and she and i love it. It has all the features you would expect from an android tablet but with nice parenting aspects to keep the kids where they should be.
Excellent product thanks !Thanks for the help choosing what I was looking for and all the variety of apps that are available on this one.
"My niece is 2 years old and she absolutely loves this tablet. It's easy for her to use and navigate through. Plus, it has parental controls which I love. Definitely recommend it."
This tablet is just the right size for my son's hands. Easy for him to use
Brought this for my daughter and it's been a life saver!!! I love that it already comes with the pink bumper it's perfect for her!! Set up was also a breeze!!! I'm very pleased with this purchase.
I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It's fast and easy to use.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video."
We purchased three of these tablets for our granddaughters and they use them everyday and enjoy them. We spoke with one of the Best Buy associates and he was great telling us about this product. Made our decision easy. Thanks.
My kids are on their tablets for hours on end. I was able to download several preschool apps for them. They actually are learning very well. The tablet us simple to use and they can navigate themselves on the tablet very easily.
Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.
Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."
This is a great tablet for the price. Gave it my not so tech savvy mom for her birthday and she loves it!
We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!
Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....
"Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games."
I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody.
"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price."
"Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand."
A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.
"What a great tablet for for the grand kids.easy to use,can't say how many times it's hit the floor and no damage."
Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.
Has all the functionality a child needs with easy parental controls. Like the child profile with only approved content.
I like this tablet it's easy to use Easy for the kids
I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA
My son loves the tablet. I like that Amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two years
Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
"Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it."
My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
"For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet."
I am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for me and easy to read and use.
I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment.
I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again.
it's a great tablet for the money. I would buy another.
Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do.
"Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality"
Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet.
"Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints."
Can't beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display.
"Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games."
"Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job."
Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
"I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough."
"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price."
"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps."
I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.
It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."
"My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it."
Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.
Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!
"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
"The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it)."
This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children.
"This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent!"
This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.
"This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the ""Amazon Android"" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!"
Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.
You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
"this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera"
"I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience."
"My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable."
"Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!"
"A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled."
"For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve."
Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.
Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected.
"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.
"This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already."
This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around.
My 3yo loves it and never wants to put it down. Lots of preloaded educational games and videos!
My daughter lovethis tablet.. only problem is it cant connect to my home wifi which is verizon
"My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it."
Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
Purchased this item after another tablet stopped working in less than a year of having. Couldn't go wrong with the two year no worry gurantee and the one year free subscription of Amazon FreeTime. Have had for about a month and it was been well worth the money already.
"Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect."
"Great tablet for toddlers. Easy yet fun. I purchased two tablets for my grandkids, ages 2 and 4. They both love it and enjoy playing with it."
I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.
I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it!
Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price
I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.
This tablet is perfect for a young child. The case it comes with is wonderful and seems very protective.
Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play.
"I purchased this tablet for my 10 year old son and he loves it. Great for movies, games and reading books online. Definetly would recommend it as a starter tablet for young children. The hard protective cover is a plus."
This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.
"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
Great for kids its durable and lets them play games etc.. so they leave our cell phones alone LOL
"I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8."
I love this tablet. I got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it.
This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.
"This is a great tablet for younger users (i'd say up to 10 years old). Performance is not on par with higher end tablets, but it is fine for younger children. The best thing about this tablet is that it comes with a 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty. This even covers cracked screens. My kids 3, 5, and 8 use these tablets on long trips. They are able to play all of their favorite games. The Amazon play store underground is excellent. It has many of their favorite games, but in app purchases are included for those games.Pros: 2 year no questions replacement policy. performance for younger children, amazon underground.Cons: display is not HD, battery life is not the best.Note there is a newer model of this device that was just released. It adds a higher resolution display and better battery life. However the new model costs 129.99 when not on sale.Overall I would recommend this tablet for children 10 and younger. It would be fine for an adult, but you can save yourself some money by buying the non kids edition of the tablet for less money."
The child that this item was purchased for hasn't put it down. He is really enjoying it!
This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth"
"Newest version of Kindle Fire product line is a hit. Larger screen for not much money, good screen resolution and longer battery life. No problems, and I'm a happy reader!"
"I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook!"
Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house.
I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."
"This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases!"
"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."

"I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks."
"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead"
"I was looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range, after doing a little research I decided to give the kindle a try and it was a GREAT decision! It has so many uses and makes it so much easier to get things done than using my phone. I would recommend for any age."
"This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet."
This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it!
I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books.
"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
"Bought this during black friday for $60. while I'm skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price!"
"Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge!"
Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun!
Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos
"Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!"
Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display
"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!"
I bought this tablet for my 1 year old and he loves it! It keeps him entertained when we go places and he has learned so much. The apps are great and perfect for him. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet.
I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet!
I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price.
"I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!"
This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning.
This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.
This tablet was affordable and it's pretty decent.
This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up.
Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!!
did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product.
This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad's though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an Instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle.
I love my new Fire HD and it takes great photos! It has a nice size screen but is compact enough to fit in my purse.
Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
I bought the tablet for my one year old son so we can use it in the car. It just a great buy. I recommend it to anyone that has young kids.
"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.
I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily.
Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies.
Purchased this tablet for my grandson who is two years old. He loved it!. But the power cord and the tablet hook up didn't work very long. I will be taking it back for a replacement. As long as the connection stays snug it's a great tablet.
This tablet is great for a child. It will stand up to accidental drops and has just enough expandability for future use. I give it 5 star!
"Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away."
"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
"Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance."
"We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year."
I bought 2 of these tablets for my Grandsons that both have Autism. They can be very hard on things and this is 1 tablet neither boy has been able to break yet. they are very easy for them to use and they LOVE them. The only thing with them is you need an Amazon account for them.
This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.
I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
great the kids love it for learning on and great on long trips
I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym
Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"
Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
"Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up"
"Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!"
I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
"The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task."
Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one
"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
"I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
"Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia""."
Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.
Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle
"Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
"Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing."
I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!
I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.
"I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great."
"I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself."
It's a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy
"My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,."
PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
"Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores."
The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
"This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime."
Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift
Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds.
"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it."
Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.
"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
"Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing."
Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.
"reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use"
"It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
"Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights."
"For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase."
"This is a great little phone. It feels like a true moto phone. I like the pure experience of the software. While it's not on par with the $600+ phones... Dollar for dollar, it is well worth the cost. Definitely a good buy."
This washer and dryer is very basic but still nice with lots of options. Great for my small family. Worth the money!
Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it

"The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness."
"My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time."
"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
"Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend
Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
"Bought these for my 5yr old twin grandkids and the enjoy the learning games so much. Love that you can limit how long child is engaged with apps, games, or movies on this and that my daughter can use her amazon prime acct with this! 2yr amazon warranty is amazing as well"
Bought this for my sister. This has replaced her I Pad. She loves it.
Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it!
Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!
Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
Got it for my son and he loves it! Definitely would recommend it!
Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too!
Purchased for our niece. She is 6 years old and it's perfect for her. She loves it!
Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.
This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
"I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!!"
Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.
Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
"This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged."
"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."

Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.
Great for the child. Unfortunately it doesn't have a volume limit setting
Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag.
"great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
"My other daughter has this same tablet, so I knew it would be a winner with my other child as well."
By far the greatest tablet for kids. Free time is fantastic. I don't have to worry about content for my child. And the two year worry free warranty is in heard of. 2 thumbs up
This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe
"Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around"
"This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc."
Is good for the kids The only thing is I have to get a SD Card for more memory
"Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild."
"Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas."
Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
"I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use
I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice.
Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.
Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this
Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day
"very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead."
Hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on.
I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy
"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product.
It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.
"I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use."
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
He loves it. Helps him learn and teaches him how to count
Purchased for an3 year old that wanted this badly. Appears to be rugged. Links up with my amazon account for content and access. 2 year warranty. Win!!!
My daughter hasn't put it down since Christmas. We're both in love! It's very easy for her to operate (she's 2) and very easy to set up. It's a win win for both parent and child.
This was the perfect gift for a loved one. She was excited to receive it.
Help my 2 year learn he loves to play it and watch movies on it
Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find
great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.
After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.
"Bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. She really enjoys it."
"It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person."
"Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless"
So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
Bought it for my 5 yr old daughter and for some reason it did not work. This is the second time I've purchased this and had to return it. So I will get her a mini iPad. Never again will I waste my time and money.
"This tablet brings hours of enjoyment educationally to the user,"
"Boy! If I had something like this when I was a kid. The learning devices these kids have today. Makes learning about different things in & around the world a fun experience. all the other activities & downloadable apps, they can be on it for hours. Like it!"
This was a huge hit with my seven-year-old grandson. I came in to replace a broken tablet and they were no longer available. So I chose this one and it's better than ever!
Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it.
The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.
"I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
"I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
"We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too."
I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.
The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case
My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.
"I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017"
"I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017"
Brought it for my niece for a Christmas and she loves it doesn't lag or anything it works just fine
I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k
I love it and I brought two more for my Grandson and God Daughter.
I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
It's definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have
Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price
"I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!"
I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.
"The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn."
Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.
i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!
The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
"I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
"I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc"
This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !
My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them
I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.
Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
"This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will."
"My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink."
"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.
It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others
A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
"I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well."
"I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
"You can not block Bing and it shows ""trending now"" News content. This can not be deleted or blocked. It also types ahead and adds content."
"This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there."
"Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!"
I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.
I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.
"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
my great grandson loves this he plays games and looks at all his pictureshe is only 2
It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.
"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
"I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted."
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time.
I bought this tablet because it was very inexpensive and the right size and fit for my daughter...
It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.

The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone
My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.
"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
It's a good piece of technology it's just not connecting to the wifi
I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
My grandson can operate the kindle fire with no problem. Just the right size for his little hands.
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!
My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.
Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great
"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."

I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.
The fire kid edition 7 is good but not great. Volume is pretty low. But my son throws it around and it doesn't break. Case is stone hard. I also the the brightness on the screen can be a bit low.
My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better
So it is working great. She loves the learning games
"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
Definitely a good product children of all ages in elementary school.
I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions.
It's nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug.
Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.
"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible."
I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow
volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.
The tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid Apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that Amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other I'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to Apple it will take some getting used to.
"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
The color is what got me and the features was on point. The screen shows a lot of different displays. To share for now until the next one.
This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it
"My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults."
Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it
"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50."
"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
"I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one."
"I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!"
This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it's just as advertised.
Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...
Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
"I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price."
It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed."
Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
"I had known Amazon was going to release the next Generation a few weeks after I bought this one! OTOH, my wife is happy with it. It just offended my geek side. However, it has Alexa and integrates well with my Philips Hue equipment."
My daughter can't get enough of this tablet. The only thing I would suggest that you have YouTube kids as a pre installed app. The adds are ridiculous for children when you download it from the App Store.
"It's a good tab for the kids, keeps them busy. Wish the speed was faster."
"Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!"
Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.
"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
"My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips."
"This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don't want to do much else"
It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!
Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this.
"We had been using the Nabi for our 3 year old, but after the reviews online about the dreamtab we decided on the amazon fire kids tablet. So far so good. Very easy for our son to navigate without worry about getting on unauthorized websites."
I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!
My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!
This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
Kindle fire is extremely easy to use. The protective foam layer is awesome.
My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages
Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy
My daughter loves her tablet I love free time love the case it came with just right to buy for a kids first tablet
This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.
"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.
Great entry level tablet for kids without the worries of easy breakage.
"My daughter loves it! She uses it with ease, which makes me an mommy very happy. No complaints. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Very helpful employees at Best Buy as well."
This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!
"Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device."
"This tablet is great. Because it's from Amazon, you can easily switch to a different profile and use it when the kids finally put it down. I have 2 1/2 year old twins and it's hard to get them to sit down. With the Kid's Kindle Fire, they are more than happy to settle down on the couch and play. I highly recommend buying one. It is a life saver!"
Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better
Very study tablets. 2 others grands liked theirs. Salesman was very helpful finding 2 different color models
She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets.
"Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too."
Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around.
"Great for kids, my kids haven't stopped playing with it"
Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them
"It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable!"
my grandkids love it. This is the 3 one we bought.
Our grand kids really love this tablet and it has a lot of app options.
"Our kids love it and the Amazon unlimited is fantastic with tons of options. However, our kids still fight over usin our grownup tablet bc the screen is larger."
Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case
The Amazon free time is very kid friendly. My 2 year old uses it with ease. Tons of kid apps for all ages
"Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate."
My kids love the tablet and it's easy for them to use
"A great little tablet built for kids with access to volumes of free apps for a year, including books, games, etc. It can be easily used by kids of almost any age."
My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!
"They keep busy, lots of kids apps to view!! Entertainig"
Works great. Easy to set time limits and goals. Easy to set up multiple profiles. Excellent product. As advertised.
Easy setup nice size only thing is the charger cords need to be more sturdy.
Probably a little too much but the device has excellent parental controls. They have used it for about a week so far with no issues.
My kids love these. I purchased 3 of them at one time. They seem really durable.
"My children think these are the greatest. I'm kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank."
A few problems with games loading but over all good
"great tablet for children, lots of content. games books etc and easy for my 4 y.o to use."
"Great, non-expensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my Ipad."
Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.
Bought this nice kindle fire kids tablet for my 18 month son for a 6 hour road trip to LA and it did the job. I downloaded some movies and apps from Amazon to keep the little guy busy. He absolutely loved it and best thing is the case it's very durable. Plus with 2 year guarantee if anything happens they'll replace it for free. We both love it!
Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.
"The grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use"
This tablet is great for kids my grandson is sick and he absolutely loves it
My 2 yr old loves his tablet. Best purchase ever. It has great educational videos and is easy for him to work on his kids profile. Amazon got it right!
"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it."
"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product."
For a five year old this worked fine but was a bit slow loading games. But 5 year olds these days want it immediately. Like the kid friendly free books and games. It worked well with downloaded Disney movies and Netflix. May have to get one for 2 year old suster they both live it
"Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics."
Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.
I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.
My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
This is really nice and has great clarity I like it.
This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase.
This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours.
Wish I could download Google Docs but otherwise very happy with my kindle fire.
Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it.
I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me
I love the quality and ease of using the kindle fire. I will like to purchase more for my family for xmas.
I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up!
Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.
"My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect."
This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!
"This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen.
"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this."
Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks
Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!
"Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email."
We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
"These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well."
This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate.
This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.
"This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
"I use my Fire every day. I'm very satisfied with it's performance and size. The battery last a long time, so I can use the Kindle for hours without recharging."
Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability.
"New Kindle Fire 8 is easy to setup, great for reading, no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network. I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet."
Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
Kids Kindle was a Christmas present for great grandson age 4. His mother has downloaded many word games and etc. from Amazon's childrens library. A big feature of the Kindle is the case and the 2 year no fault warranty. His Mother says he loves the Kindle and uses it all the time. Great purchase.
love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.
Would be lost without my kindle and kindle unlimited spend lots of time reading
it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
"I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books...."
I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
"I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!"
Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights.
My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.
Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).
This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"

This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you.
i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
I like the design and easy to navigate. The case provides good protection.
For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.

I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc."

The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.
I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use
"Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games."
"Not disappointed, if you want good screen for movies, this is it"
"I bought this for my daughter. It's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. She's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it."
We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY
Got it as a present and love the size of the screen
If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!.
"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"
I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!!
as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized.
"My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch."
Need to have better info for special needs children. The kids utube is confusing but love the guarantee
"I bought the 8"" to replace my old 7"". I love the bigger screen"

Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected.
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
"great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,"
"Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price."
Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick.

"I bought 3 for my three granddaughters for Christmas. They love it. I love it too, free games, books, movies"
I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card.
I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.
"I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn't like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out."
I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.

I need the Geek Squad to help me with the Amazon Prime I purchased it for 2 granddaughters but I don't want them to have access to my books.
"I purchased one for myself, then went back bought one for my niece. Then thought how much I love the ease and function of the Kindle got my sister one. I can't say how much I use my Kindle my niece and sister agree best gift I every gave them."
I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.
"I traded this in after receiving a 7"" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy."
i very happy with my tablet i love it and if i ever get a new one it will be bigger love it
"ilovemy kindle 8"" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8"" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know."
It's simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times.
Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it.
My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.
"My kids love this tablet. There are over hundreds of games, books, and shows to pick from"
"My niece loves this tablet. It's very durable, but charges slow"
"My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games."
My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.
Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it.
Tablet is for my 2 year old son and it has great learning game so for him! He's learning to read and so much more!
Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use
The Kindle fire kids edition is a parent worry free solution to kids messing up potential settings love that you can set up a personal code and create multiple profiles
The only draw back to this device is no internet service included. My 1 year old granddaugther loves hers and I don't leave home without it.
The parental controls are amazing! Super easy for my daughter to operate
This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle.
This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends.
This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.
Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.
Wanted something small and this was perfect size .
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Perfect for a 5 year old
"Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the ""FIRE"""
The kindle fire kid is easy enough that our 2 year old can work it!!!
"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her."
"At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.."
love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service
I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!!
I bought one for my son for his birthday. Loved it so much I bought a second one for my self.
it was very easy to sit up and get it to working and plying games and down loading
Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.
"Absolutely love my kindle. There was a glare on the screen when I was out in the sun, but once my eyes got adjusted it was just fine!"
Bought this for my 8 year old. He loves it and it's very simple to add the perfect parental controls!
Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it! Has so many apps I can download that he loves.
Can't say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it.
Great for my kiddo! He loves to watch Sesame Street on it :)
"Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN!"
Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.
"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again."
I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options.
"I love the parental controls available. You can set what time they can start and stop using, as well as how much time on each activity. Also love the guarantee of replacement."
"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix."
"My kids enjoy this tablet, as do I! The only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.Also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken."
Pros: preloaded with everything your kids will need.Cons: need to buy at least 32GB microSD with it.
Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!
"This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product!"
This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it
This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!
very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.
"my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn't understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle."
I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!

My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy!
Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.
This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle.
This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.
"I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE"
holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had
I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts
Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go.
Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!
This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.
"We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!!"
"Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
"Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up."
I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use
"I've had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I'm very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price."
Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display
Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.
I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one.
"It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
"It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
Love my Kindle. It has taken over the place of my laptop completely with all other added benefits.
"This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle."
This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera.
Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.

I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift.
"I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music."
im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!
"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.
I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!
"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.
"I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time."
Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.
haven't opened yet since its a Xmas present for my 2 yr. Old I love that there is a kids zone area where she can learn numbers letters shapes and has nice thick bumpers to keep it from breaking as well has a warranty if it breaks
Would recommend this to others better than kindle fires of best
Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one!
We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
"This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I'm really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle!"
"I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it."
Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.
I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
Great picture compared to my last kindle and love the camera option
My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.
I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
"It's get for my 6 and 4 year old boys, and they love them"
My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!
This thing has it all...even the cartoons that my older kids watched. Plenty of activities and teaching. 5 stars
Love this kid's tablet - it's kid proof! It's perfect for kids of all ages!
This is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free. It keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning.
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.

Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.
"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination"
Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
My granddaughter loves this tablet it is durable..
"Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,"
The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.
Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well
"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!
Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.
Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one
"I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you."
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. We take it everywhere.
Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet
"So far the 1yo loves it. I thought it would be too much, but no."
"Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can't do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product.
I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!
"I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it."
This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.
Always content with best buy and their products. I would definitely recommend.
Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service....."
Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around
"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.
Just picked up from BB a couple of hours ago. Screen in good and tablet seems faster than previous model possibly due to more memory. Battery so far seems very good.
Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!
Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
"I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me."
"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it.
"Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available."
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
"I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price."
"I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK."
It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.
I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.
"Great for my one year old baby,he loves to play games and watch movies.."
Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
"Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books."
I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.
Great screen clarity and rapid turn on.All function you need in a transportable tablet
"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"
"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"
"Easy to setup, and easy to switch between adult and kid profiles. The foam case allows it to take a beating"
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each
"My son loves this tablet, he will not put it down!"
"Got this to replace my iPhone that my daughter constantly has to have to watch her Elmo videos. This is a durable perfect solution. She understands most of the apps and can navigate to watch whatever she wants. This comes with a warranty that if she does anything to break it, it will be replaced for free. That was the final selling point I needed!"
My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it.
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.
This was a Christmas present for my 3 year old son. He loves having his own 'pad pad'. He sees everyone else with a tablet and can now play age appropriate games and watch his shows without me having to worry.
"My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight."
It is easy and fun to use. This was a gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. She can play on it for hours.
This tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.
I am pleased that my 6 year old grandson was happy with his gift
No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.
"Perfect for kids. He has his own tablet, and I can control all access to everything. I don't have to worry about what he's getting into...."
"I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price."
"Aiden's is loving his tablet, using educational apps learning his letters and numbers"
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my toddler and she loves it.
my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone.
Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
"My daughter love it, she always get busy with it.."
Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it.
This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints.
My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now.
my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better
Works great for everything we want our daughter to do
This is her second Kindle product. she loves the new colors and bigger screen.
I never have any issues with this company or products!
Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise!
"Grand child loves it, before she had to look at her favorite movies. On the computer monitor,Now she can look at her movies anywhere."
She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school
this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday
I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
"I had bought a Nabi for my granddaughter and she finally broke it. Out of warranty, I just fugured I'd purchase another one since she is familiar with it. After reading reviews, decided kids are pretty sharp and can pick up new things quickly ( she's 4!). She had no trouble with it at all and my daughter says she loves it! So far no complaints from a technical standpoint."
She uses it every day. She can't get enough of it.
Unfortunately my grandson has broken the glass somehow.
My grandson is very happy with his Kindle. The case protects it very well.
Basically it does everything that adult Amazon tablet does
I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great
It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty...
"Sturdy construction, withstands toddlers use or (abuse)"
Great learning tool and tough exterior makes it the PERFECT gift for a three year old.
It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!
This holds my grandson attention on a regular basis.
This is just what we needed for a you k8d ..the apps are great
I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much.
He loves his new tablet lots of fun and educational games to choose from and best of all very kid proof he has dropped it numerous times and I see no signs of damage whatsoever
My kid loves it. It's really convenient for us to put educational games on it for him.
Bought for my 4yr old for Christmas. Love that they have a product that my child can learn from and enjoy as well. Great warranty. Thank you Amazon.
I purchased 2 of this Amazon Tablet for my 2 kids - 4 & 3yrs old.They just can't keep there eyes off this they fondly call IPAD.My wife laugh every day when they tell her to recharge their IPAD.
Awesome tablet for young children. They love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it.
Got this for my kids they wont put it down but can be confusing with setup
It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...
"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it."
The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!
"My little one is always grabbing our phones and tablets so it was a no-brainer to get her her own. We load it with kid-friendly learning programs (simple things like match colors and shapes, etc.) and hand it to her and she will have tons of fun. The protective case is essential since she still likes to throw things around."
I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there
"This is easy, educational, durable, and very entertaining."
"This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price."
I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix
Great tablet for destructive toddlers. My son has dropped and thrown it several times and it still works!...
"This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's ""awesome"", which is high praise indeed."
"This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok"
He loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe
"It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
My son loves this product and uses it all the time.
Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly!
My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.
Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!!
My son really likes the larger screen to play games.
My son uses his Fire everyday. I wish the screen was a little larger is all.
My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter
I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`
"This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty."
My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.
This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.
"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!
Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.
"These kindle tablets are beginning to get pretty cheap. Especially when the other kids tablets are relatively close in pricing. Nothing has gone wrong with this Kindle as of now, and our niece has been enjoying it. A kids account and adult account is made. The kids accounts has access to whatever the adults account allows. This is pretty standard in kids tablets, but this one handles it well. It makes it much easier."
My daughter puts this thing through the ringer it's tough and durable. Highly recommend it.
I liked it a lot for my four year old and it is kids proof
"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
"It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally."
This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.
I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.
"Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music."
"What you think you need more than a Kindle to surf the web? You don't. Cheap and effective. Plus it's an alarm clock too, plus with the right apps it's a radio, what's that you say a clock/radio? You know it hipsters."
Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!
"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading."
I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
"I haven't had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I've downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money."
My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile.
I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.
I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.
I purchased this as a gift and I'm had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations.
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!
It's a lovely game for kids wolf my daughter have one and I love it
It's big then the one I had I would tell my friends
"Like the screen,easier to read.happy that we bought it"
My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix!
Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good.
Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....
Nice for kids. Like the free apps built in the device. Can control what and how long they get to use screen time
This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user.
"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."

Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7.
"This is a nice and cheap android device. HD display and Amazon's sturdy build quality with 10 hours+ battery backup. Sometimes runs a little slow, rest is good"
Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.
Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far
It's a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get
"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it."
i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.
"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating."
Bought for my grandson and the programs that were included with the device give a wide variety of education tools
"Great price for the internal memory size. If you are looking for a good tablet, this is it!"
"for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain !"
Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader.
this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.
Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it
Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities
If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.

Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
Very sturdy for little people who might drop it easy to read
Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.
"Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more?"
"I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!"
the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
"the product is really crafted for kids n they just glue to it as it offers an array of rich topics, apps, etc"
"Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!"
Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.
I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
A great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who likes ti play games and read books.
Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.
Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.
Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.

Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop.
"Not an iPad, but that's not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do."
Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment.
PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
"Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one."
i upgraded from an older kindle that wasn't backlit. The quality and ease of use is much better and I love the backlit feature!
"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend.
"I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone."
"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
"I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it"
Tablet is nice to play movies for kids. The amazon free play is Ok. Seems unorganized.
the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire
"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned."
Awesome good size large enough for games and photos
Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.
Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.
Doesn't disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet.
"Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price"
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.
I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display
I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space"
My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games.
"my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger"
My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!

Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.

Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.
"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate.
"Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
"Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own."
"Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case."
My grandson is 2 years old and loves his tablet. I do recommended for young kids
"My granddaughter really likes it. ""She"" found age-appropriate games to play."
My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.
Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.
An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!
The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
"love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues"
Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case
This is a very nice tablet for my GF who has never had one before.
i always buy from best buy. they have excellent products.The workers are very knowledgeable of what they sell.Thanks
This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.
I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.
"Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading."
"I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it.
This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
They had the tablet in stock and it is nice that it has the child settings
i can allow kids what i want them to read or play with
"There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding."
"My husband's previous tablet died a sudden death, so I gave it back and bought this FIRE. The sound volume and quality is much better."
"Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
"Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet"
"I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too."
This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild
"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
"needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us"
"I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer."
Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
"This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password."
Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps.
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket
Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy.
Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good.
Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games!
I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money."
"I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+."
This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..
Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.
horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.
It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android
"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though"
Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
"I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this."
Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth.
"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working."
"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."
Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.
"I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!"
Picture quality is not good. I don't like this product
"Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone"
"this item is not good ok ...no use for my kids ,,,"
"I originally looked at a Samsung in the store to purchase for my just turned 2 year old. The salesperson talked me into buying this tablet. It would be great for an older child, as the learning games preloaded are pretty advanced. They are way over my child's head and he is advanced for his age. I thought that I might just be able to go to the Playstore and download the learning games that I wanted from there but it will not let me access that. Very disappointed. We don't really even use it. Maybe next year."
Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too."
I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.
When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.

Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.
"Bought as a Mother's Day Gift. This is great for someone who does not already have a tablet, and is a bit uncomfortable with technology. The tablet guides you pretty well, and once we had it setup with OverDrive, the recipient was very happy. FREE LIBRARY KINDLE BOOKS!"
Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it
Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy
I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!

Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son."
"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase."
My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.
Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.
"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading."
"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!"
bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations
"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
"Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet."
Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
I'm used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate
I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
"Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........"
Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok
Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!
"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications.
Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.
Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it's a bargain
Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
Our young son spends hours fully engaged playing games on his tablet.
Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.
"The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8"" vs. 7"") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors."
I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.
This tablet has been a great learning tool for my child.
"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
"Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value."
"my 7"" wore out,my 8"" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !"
"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
"Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.
Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.
i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us.
awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use
"Bought as a gift for my Mom. She's so happy. Therefore, I'm happy"
Bought this for a grandchild. Perfect gift. Recommend this.
Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere
"For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing!"
Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price.
Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad
I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with
"My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one."
Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around
"Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it."
This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings
The guy at the store was really helpful. There was not a pink Fire Kids Edition so he looked on top of all the shelves and found one. My four year old grand daughter loves it.
I love it for reading magazines and checking my email.
"This was perfect for entertaining my 20-month old great grandson during car trips, shopping and bedtime."
"I bought this case for my son, fits perfectly! Easy to put on, love it!"
This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps!
the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy
I bought this for my son's 7th birthday and he loves it!
Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.
I own 3 Kindles. They are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. The case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. It's easy to use and she loves it.
Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
I bought this for my toddler and its perfect. He is rough with it and it still works. I wanted something that I use to teach him the basics of using a tablet and this worked great. It comes with a 2 yrs warranty.
I have a 3 year old at home. Best purchase ever! Indestructible. Reliable. Easy to program. I would highly recommend this.
"So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine."
"My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied."
"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price."
my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!
"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle.
"Can be dropped, thrown and doesnt break. awesome tablet"
I love this tablet. It's durable and my niece loves it
My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others.
"My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well"
"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls
Easy to set up and turn on and off restrictions. Piece of mind that daughter can't access adult appropriate content
I like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. It has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .
My daughter loves this! Expandable storage helps when we make our twice yearly drive to Texas and all the games and apps are definitely age appropriate so I don't have to worry about get getting onto anything she isn't supposed to be on!
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books."
It's all the great features of the Fire but with added bonuses for the kids. The app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.
Our children tend to forget to get gentle with the kindle so the replacement plan is great. And I don't have to worry about the wrong kind of content popping up. It's a relief.
"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.
"This is perfect for my 3 year old. He loves this. The charger can be a little tricky at times, so I do have to be the one to plug it in. I've made sure to download a few of his favorite things on it for when we are offline & it's worked just fine. I will be buying an SD card soon to give him more room though, but we haven't run into any issues so far."
Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.
"My grandson loves it! It's exactly what he needed. I'm very pleased with it, and so is he!"
I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.
This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.
Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1
These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.
I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.
Leapfrog is a great learning tool for preschoolers and beyond my grandson loves it
It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.
"Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable."
This has the all speed and storage I needed for my first grader. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.
Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants.
"The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows"
"Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them."
Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music.
"If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect."
I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.
Use this on flights to watch movies and pass the time!
"This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping!"
"Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies"
I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.
"I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all."
This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it.
It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.
My kids love their kindles and love free time in it. Numerous educational games!
Piece of mind that the little one won't wonder the World Wide Web and be exposed to things no parent wants to have to explain!
"My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands."
Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it's so user friendly she's able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance.
"Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself"
I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.
its a great great gift that can be used by everyone
My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.
"My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great."
My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
My 3 year old has one and my 10 year old wanted one so now they BOTH have one. The parental controls are easy to use and work great. I would highly recommend to anyone!
"I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it."
Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price!
"Got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! Lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. What really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that Amazon offers!"
"I enjoy using this Kindle fire 8"". The apps are easy to install, the screen is a great size. I can even use it without my glasses."
"My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy!"
My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.
"After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use."
Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
"After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet."
This product is easy to use and take along with you
"Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze."
My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos.
Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)
"This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it."
Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied."
This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.
My great-granddaughter loves this tablet. She plays so many games and watches her favorite cartoons. She just completed kindergarten and everything is programmed for her age. Best gift ever!!!!
We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids."
I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.
This tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. It has lots of fun apps for the kids.
"We bought these knowing we had a couple of long plane rides ahead of us...we have not regretted them one bit. They are easy to use for the kids, come with lots of fun apps/games/books...Best part for us was being able to add a memory card, so we could add movies and as many apps as we needed without worrying about space."
"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
"We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied."
Ordered one for my daughter. It's the fourth Kindle we have bought and love them. Perfect for watching videos and movies.
I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.
I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!
My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.
Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.
and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
"I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help."
Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.
"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption."
This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
"First time buying a kindle, mostly for my 4 years old to have his own device so he won't use our iPad.Pro: light and has padded protection all around so it won't damage. Kid friendly.Con: hard to navigate and go to YouTube directly. We have always use the Apple device so it was hard for us to figure out where everything is. My son uses YouTube mostly and he gets frustrated when he can't find the app. After few months we are still learning to use this devise."
small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
"Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money"
"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.
Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
These two boys were thrilled with the Fire tablet. Every time I see them they are glued to the tablet. They both have said it is the best present EVER. Extra points to the grandfather on these gifts!
This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment
"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
Great tablet great screen built well responds well
"Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera"
Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!
"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version."
Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.
This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.
"And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started."
"This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus"
I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago.
"The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
"This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you...
"still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too."
"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging."
I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline. Great price.
I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!
and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot.
My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!
Being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up makes this device super user friendly!
"This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends!"
"Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link"
"Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
I really like the price and quality of the product
My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.

Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.
Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
"Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
"Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. I will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product"
This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
"Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games."
"Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!"
"I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet."
My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!!
Internet usage is restricted. I returned it for a regular Kindle Fire and bought the kids case and Geek Squad protection plan instead.
I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift.
It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
"For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic."
"Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet."
This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend."
"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying."
"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
"I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
"I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it's purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don't need them so I don't use them and it's not a big deal for me."
"This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture."
A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops
Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
We got this for our three year old daughter. At first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my iPad
"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls"
Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
"The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft."
bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing
Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all..."
"After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking."
"I haven't done much with it so far, but I haven't been disappointed with anything that I've tried."
"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
"It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory.
"This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up
"Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer."
So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.

"I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it."
Bought this for a 2 year old. She loves it! She's already got more things figured out on it than I do!. Good educational programs and some fun ones too!
"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
"I am so very i got this for my 3 year old grandson. He can navigate it to get to his favorite shows, Peppa pig, Mickey clubhouse and Thomas the train. He is so happy with his tablet."
"Better loading, longer battery life, clearer picture, more space. Still just as durable!"
"After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg"
You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !
"Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The 'excited factor' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either."
"bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features..."
"I'd suggest 8-12 is a good age for this tablet, it's a great starter tablet until your young one shows responsibility, care and proper use of electronics."
"For the price, it's tough to get a better tablet than the Kindle Fire. It's not the same quality as higher priced tablets, and you're locked into Amazon's ecosystem, but if you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet, the Kindle Fire is a good choice."
This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
"This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don't have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor's or dentist's office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.."
My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome
My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.
"Helps keep my son entertained on long rides, and it's pretty indestructible."
Easy to navigate and my son just loves it pkus a year free of service.
Great purchase for my son's 6th birthday. He love it and the kid account is a great addition
"My two year old loves the videos,games and books this tablet provides."
works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.
"Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device."
"Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased."
"My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which."
"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it.
"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long."
My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!
Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
my daughter is girly so the fact that its pink is perfect! we take it everywhere with no fears of her breaking it when it drops and she stays entertained .
"This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling."
Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.
kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there
"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one."
Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
"I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product."
This newest version of Fire works great! Responds fast to opening apps and speed of browser is quick. The color choices are nice too!
Was a great birthday present for my son that only gets to use it when it's absolutely necessary.
I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.
The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone

"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient.
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present
nice and easy-to-use for a 3 yr old ..............
Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.
Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use.
Tablet works pretty good. I purchased it since I was a to make two accounts. One for myself and one for my child. Goo buy!!
The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.
This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off
"I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet"
This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.
I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device
Gift for great nephew. Have 2 that are 5 and 6 y/o. Both love these tablets because each got one. Play with them as much as Mom allows.
Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.
"Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift."
"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.

"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging"
Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price.
"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!
I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.

"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.
Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."
"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."
I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you
"The tablet is just what a child needs, it's tuff and the content is aimed at the children's needs. It keeps them entertained as long as you will let them."
"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money."
My 3yr. old loves this tablet. Easy for her to use. She watches videos plays games.
Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well.
Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.
Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
Its a good product and also you can be monitoring what can your kids see
"This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!"
I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
I have a kindle fire and love mine so I decided to get one for each of the grandkids. There are so many learning games that are fun for them plus you have parental control
"The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better!"
We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.
"My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away."
"I purchased the Kindle Fire 8"" after owning a 7"" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version."
It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast!
The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
"My daugther used to have a leap frog tablet, but when it started to have battery issues I went to the store and found out that they no longer produced the tablet, so best buy gave me store credit and they recomended me this tablet. My daugther loves it and so do I. On kidz mode I can rest assured that she is only going to see kids safe content like interactive book, games and apps. On tablet mode she can watch movies with the SD card slot which can go all they way to 128GB!I put a 32 GB which help us on our loooong christmas trip..."
"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
"Excellent value for small laptops. Lenovo 11.2"" screens with flash memory & Microsoft Word for 1 year."
"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!!
"My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case."
"Bought for my 2 year old granddaughter l, she loves it, so easy to use .. She can navigate through it with no problems"
"This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly!"
"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new.
"Where do I begin? It comes with an amazing thick case, it's a fully functioning tablet. It also comes with a one year subscription to educational games and movies/ shows. If it breaks Amazon replaces! How could you choose any other tablet? This was so great we had to get two!"
"I was impressed with the overall of this Kindle, it has so many nice features and easy access."
This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc.
i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime
This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.
works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well
My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome.
"I bought one last year for my 1 1/2 years old granddaughter and believe me, she loves it. She deals with it perfectly. We put a 128 GB card and downloaded music, videos and movies. And she finds everything. A few days ago I bought another for my twins grankids. They are only 11 month old but we are going to start putting their music and movies. With the bluetooth they will enjoy it. I got a Free in-store set up so their mom will learn how to use it."
This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price.
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
"Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money."
"It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price"
"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
"I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: ""A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone!"
"My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it."
"My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!!"
"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!"
"I bought the Tablet for my grandson for Christmas. It was the best investment that I have made in all time. He is learning so much that he can't put it down. As a matter of fact, he sleeps this it just about every night."
I purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter after having purchased her older sister one last year when she was 3. It's comforting knowing it has as durable cover to endure the energy of a toddler.
I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....
"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use.
We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
"I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
Touch response is not so good. so my kid refused to play games on this.Returned this product. Thanks to Bestbuy for the full refund
I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."

awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire
The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!
I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal!
"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge."
Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
"My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading"
"Aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an Android tablet would be able to get from the playstore, which was hilariously wrong, this product would never connect to the internet correctly. I had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it, starting from day one and up. My son loved having the electric device and I didn't take it back for those reasons, but now 60 days out, the thing doesn't even charge anymore and I'm having to take it back in. At least I bought the warrenty, because this is literally a huge waste of money. I'd rather have spent $500 on a different tablet than this garbage."
Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
"Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!"
"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old."
"You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab."
Glad that I get to control the time spent on which sure site and apps.
"I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration."
"Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet."
My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
"I received an email asking if I would like to give my review and I am glad that I did. I purchased this less than 2 months ago and it has already quit working. It will not charge and it will no longer power on. All I have is a black screen. When it did work, it dropped internet quite frequently and froze several times during use. I would not recommend this product."
It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on
"I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me."
"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
"Very durable, but could be a little more suited for young kids."
works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet
This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value
"Bought this for my granddaughter who was 2 at the time. She loves it. It is very easy to use and is very durable. The kindle has been dropped, thrown and sat on and it still works like it did when it was first purchased. Am considering buying one for her younger brother."
"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it
My 3 year old daughter loves playing on her fire. The apps are all very entertaining and easy enough for her to use.The only thing I have had difficulty with is accessing youtube or the internet.
great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
"Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners."
Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I'm traveling!!
It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.
Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.
The service was great and the help I received thanks
Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
"Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,"
Does exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend for an inexpensive travel reader.
The kids couldn't wait to turn them on and I'm very excited.
This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great.
Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!

"Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price"
"Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.
"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty."
"Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi."
"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."

"Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
"Grandson has loved this since he opened it for his Birthday He was able to use it,figure it out, right away The protective case actually makes it easier for him to handle. Simple to set up for his home internet and parents were able to view and set up controls of their choice."
I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
"Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads"
Bought this as a gift for my mom and couldn't be more pleased at how she is enjoying it.
So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
"First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good!"
Love how easy it is for my 9 year old sone to navigate around. The unlimited kindle free time is great too we like that we are able to set time limits as well as only allow age appropriate games and content. Our son Not only loves playing Minecraft and watching netflix on it but enjoys the reading the books as well.
Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones."
This was a gift to my niece. Her mom liked the parental controls
"I like that it is not linked to google, this tablet has better parental controls,and its perfect for little ones the case is a awesome bonus also."
"Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found."
Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!
"I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee"
"The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7."
This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
"I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
"I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the ""educational"" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself."
"I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
"This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones."
This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.
"The new tablet is great ÔºÅ nice upgradesÔºÅLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web."
I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly!
We purchased this as a gift and the feedback we have received has been great.
"VERY parent friendly! Extremely thorough parental controls. We were told at the store there was no way to block internet or control other content on a tablet, so we decided not to get one. Then, we read about the integrated parental controls with the Fire and gave it a try. It allowed us to do everything we wanted and more. Also, very easy set up and use!"
Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.
"The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
I will recommend for other parents to buy this product
"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality"
Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
"I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics."
Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
"Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person."
"The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful"
"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
It is better than we expected and couldn't be happier.
"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don't do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay.
Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
Slow response. Wait 5 sec to turn a page. Frustrating. Best Buy says too bad so sad for me.
We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering.
"Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well"
The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
"It's really a good product to buy for kids. A lot of educational games . They can their favorite kids show from youtube, Netflix etc. The cover is really good. I'm gonna another one for my daughter."
i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great.
"The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn't lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase!"
I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained.
"This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too."
YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
"7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge."
"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
Bought a new Fire tablet for my wife for a Mother's Day gift to replace an old tablet. She is fully enjoying the new device and fashionable case. Best Buy staff were very helpful too.
My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.
"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
"We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range."
"My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it!"
This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
"This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use."
"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
Great-----------------------------------------------
I purchased this tablet because of its reputation very satisfied
My grandson loves it. Will be getting another one.
I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding
"The Amazon Kids Fire keeps my grandson captivated with lots of activities. He loves that it's just right for his little hands. He makes sure that everyone in the family knows the Kindle belongs to him by saying, ""It's mine!"""
Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer!
Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!
"My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it."
"This is a great tablet for kids. Keeps them busy with so much to do, watch, and create."
This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.
"I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok."
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8"" screen. The price was perfect for my budget."
This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup.
Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.
I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!
"Love this for my youngest. He had a Nabi, but it just wasn't as user friendly as this is."
Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
I love this! My Grand Daughter loves it when we are out and about she has something to show her how to learn things!
"I bought this as a gift for my elementary school aged niece. She immediately put it to work playing games and watching video. Her face lit up and in the nearly two months since I purchased it for her, she's had no problems!"
Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!
"Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself."
"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far."
"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy."
I needed something that could keep my toddler busy while traveling. The preloaded videos and games did the work.
"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it"
I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend
"Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it"
Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.
"Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
My husband installed. Took him longer than he thought
Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view
"Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty."
Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
Simple to operate for a 3 yr old . Would recommend
"We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals"
So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather
Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues
"the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
"Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device"
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.
this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon
"It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer."
"Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos."
"I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!"
"This was a replacement for a poorly functioning new purchase of a Kindle 7. Seems to be working fine, but some games loading from Amazon have issues."
"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news."
This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage
"This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good."
I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.
"I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."
This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.
"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
Grandson picked it up & used it right away. He enjoys the tablet.
my son has been using our computer and we got him this and he never looked back.
Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games
I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.
this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product."
The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.
"Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy."
"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it."
This a great tablet for a child. Fully functional Amazon fire tablet with a special GUI just for the little ones . Plus a 2 year warranty no matter what happens to it. Definitely worth it!
"Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
"Such a great deal for a small fee, just right for a toddler of three."
I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read
I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids
This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.
"Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price."
"This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!"
"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
"This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far."
Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers
"I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn't think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn't need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too!"
Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.
"best e reader to date. yes it's a bit pricey, but it reads like a real book."
"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading"
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"
Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable
"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!"
"I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point."
I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
"Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly."
"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.
"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have."
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough."
the back light nad easier to read in all lightings
"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)"
"Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train."
Very happy and satisfiedEasier to handle. Fast charging
Easy on the eyes. Smaller and even better than earlier versions
"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels"
"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience."
"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it."
Got this as a gift for friend of mine they have been very happy with this can't believe how light it is and how well you can read the text. If you're up for him and don't want to be caring around an iPad or have battery life on the product while you're on location this is a must take with you product.
"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is."
"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
Purchased it for my daughter. She love this very much. It is really good.
"The touch control, page change controls, are a little to sensitive. Web browser ""too"" experimental."
lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle
"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs."
Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.
"I love this e-reader. My other reader was not backlit so needed something I could use in low light. This works perfectly for reading at night and in the sun. The light is adjustable. Love downloading books from the library. It has a 3G connection which I have not used yet, so far used only in wi-fi areas."
Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking
"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all."
The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
"I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light"
"the Kindle Voyage is the very best ereader that I've ever used. The light is great and does bother my eyes in the the dark at all (iPads, Fire and Nook tablets bother me in dim light and extended reading) while providing light read by. The controls are simple and easy to learn. However it is slightly pricey. For me the quality and relief are well worth the price."
Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it.
"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
Replaced original paper white with this new model and the recipient just loves it!!
BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
"It is easy to use and have a huge selection of books, I recomend it"
Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.
No complaints works great and the battery is awesome as always
"Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader."
As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.
Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.
"Very easy on the eyes. Easy to carry, fits in my purse"
This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner. The much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire.
"Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it."
Replaced paper white with voyage...amazing screen!
Like the smaller size. Can read in sunlight or no light. Carry in my purse to read when have time.
This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update
I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.
"I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi."
I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book
"I've had Amazon Kindles since v1. Each new release surpasses the one before it, as you would expect, but does so in ways that always improve the user experience. I love the feel of this one - great size, great weight, and I love the backlit screen."
Kindle Voyage is absolutely the best! Easy to read in sunlight!Ordered from Best Buy and it shipped immediately!
Great product. Love using it for reading and search.
i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd
Like that I can use it in so many ways. As a computer or a tablet
"I've had a Kindle since they first came out and was happy to get one with a backlit screen. I like the WiFi and the 3G because I like the freedom of downloading books and newspapers while in the car, at the beach, by the pool when another guest recommends a new book. I still haven,t figured out some of the buttons, and because it is smaller I am always turning the page. I have adjusted the font and how far apart the lines are, but it still seems like I'm doing more page turning."
The voyager is light weight and easy to hold. Love the ability to have 3G and Wi Fi. Easily was able to transfer books from my old kindle keyboard. Holds a charge for up to 2 weeks and charges quickly. Great when traveling
I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it
"I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device!"
"Excellent e-reader, with great download ability. I really do not need the 3G as most of my downloads are through my PC."
"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."
"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost."
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
The Kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. Her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. She loves both products and couldn't be happier with the products.
"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two)."
"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have."
"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!"
"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go."
I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.
"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far."
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against."
"Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter!"
"I had been using a Kindle Fire HD for a couple of years, but over time found I was mainly using it for reading. I had been considering switching to a pure ereader for a while, but was not convinced until I saw some specs on the Voyage. I ordered it right away and have been very happy with it."
Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.
This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday
"I purchase it for my wife, is very good, small and fast."
"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
"Easy to use, good battery life, great back lighting."
Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.
Great e reader. Preffered the brighter display of the voyage over the paperwhite. Happy with 3G connection for all time access.
This kindle is so sharp and turns pages quickly. I can finish books quickly and store so many on here. Perfect!
This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading -
Amazing way to keep my kids reading and also to have for games
Got this for my father and he enjoys it. Plus I got it on black friday pricing too
I bought for my son. Bought the thick blue bumper with it. 30 dollars for tablet on Black Friday. I liked it so much that I bought 3 more as Christmas stocking stuffers. He‚Äôs 17 months old and loves it.
The kids loved the tablets. They have many games that they play on their new tablet that they can't play on their other devices because they cost money. Great tablet!
i bought my younger nephews tablets for Christmas they loved them and they were very affordable and they work amazing!
Easy to download needed apps and programs. Alexa is an amazing addition to kindle. My children absolutely love it.
"I have one and the grand children always fighting over. Now, they have their own!"
I love the Amazon fire tablets. They are reliable. And I buy them as gifts for loved ones and students; for online learning.
price is cheap for big discount. but display size is not big and OS is a bit slow than apple
"This is not the first kindle i buy, but the others were for my kids or gifted to kids so they broke at some point. This one was for me, i didn‚Äôt hurry to buy a cover as i am a veeery careful person. Well i was sorry to see the back (yes, the back) cracked within a month, no drop whatsoever, i keep it on my bedside table to read at night."
Kids love it...watch YouTube and Netflix on it...great for streaming
Since it is a Christmas gift it has not been opened yet. I bought it because I liked it as well as the price.
An unbelievable deal for a tablet that works better than a 99.00 Samsung. I added a 9.99 32 GB micro card and am all set.
Awsome ................ ....................... ...
This tablet it will do the job but mostle for games videos YouTube etc is really slow so if you are looking for somthing fas skip this tablet
It is definitely not the fastest or the best looking tablet but for $30 is more than enough to browse the web and do some shopping.
It's my 3rd purchase of the amazon Fire. Got extended warranty. So basically getting the next one at 50% off next year
"the tablet is very easy to set up, the connection to WFi was very straight forward and works reliably,"
My niece absolutely love her kindle. She plays games and watch movies
Found this to be a great tablet for reading and games
i bought my grand daughter the tablet and it works better than i expected
This is a gift for my great grandchildren ages 4 & 7 years.
Ok for the price product is ok not bad easy to use
Its good for a cheap tablet just for checking a website or playing a game like candy crush
"This was a gift to my husband that did not want the learning challenge. Yet, he loves it now."
Good cartridge by HP. Like being able to order online and then pick up at the store. Saves me running to the store only to find they might be out.
Definitely got my money worth when I got this product the day after thanksgiving and it was well worth it! My son had a kids kindle so I already knew how to get around it from having to use and set up his. Easy to use. Can‚Äôt load alot of extra and it‚Äôs a tad slower right now due to getting one with a smaller memory but nothing a bigger memory card won‚Äôt solve :)
"Good, fast and responsive. The price is also very reasonable. Great for what I need this tablet for. I use it to stream music to my soundbar."
The product is handy and good. The service is excellent.
Easy to set up and start using right away. I connect it to wifi and it works pretty good. Buffers a lot when I walk around with it and am trying to watch a show or something. Phone seems to work better on wifi. But it has good picture quality and a long battery life.
This is a pretty good tablet for the price of the tablet
This was a good buy for gifts and very satisfied with quality
It is a better tablet then the rest better reviews and a good price
Awesome value for the price tons of apps and good screen quality
Bought it for a gift for someone. Was on sale for.
Great tablet I have bought like 5 of them they are great
I like them and they are easy to use and my son love it
My great little neice loved her taplet she got for Christmas. It is easy for to handle and to learn how to use for age.
I love this product so far. No issues so far. Will shop again.
"Love the fire 7, just what I wanted. Great value for the money"
I brought it for my 4 year old and she loves it. It's easy to control her settings and the screen size is a plus.
Purchased for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.
Would recommend it to everyone small enough to fit in my purse
This item was on sale for Black Friday. Perfect for traveling with kids.
I love the camera. Easy for kids to use. Holds a lot of apps.
"These kindled are great for my kids. There are parental controls, it allows them to have apps to play games that are approved for their profile. They are durable and don't have cracked screens with dropping."
Great for the price! Can't beat it. Good for a young kid or adult.
I bought this for my grandson for a Christmas present.
The tablet was easy to set up and use. Just the right size for travelling or relaxing at home. Great value for the price.
Great gift for my nieces. Its good for their games and movies
I bought this for my 11 year old to read on and she loves it!
Great inexpensive tablet for kids to play with. The only downside with this tablet is the annoying ads. But I can't complain too much I only paid $35 for it.
My son loves this tablet built tough and sturdy at great price
These are PERFECT for the kids to use at home and in the car when traveling!!!
I purchased this for my mother as a stocking stuffer.
Purchased as a gift for a child and she loves it!!
my grandkids love it and they are five and they work it themselves
I purchased this for my son and he loves it. It‚Äôs perfect for a child or someone who just wants a simple tablet.
"I was shopping for a tablet for my mother. She uses her phone for games and social media, but she wanted a larger device, but wasnt interested in using features that may come with a much pricier tablet. This tablet is PERFECT for her. Battery lasts long, she can watch her shows, play games, and do social media while at her doctor appointments. It's light, durable, and a great price since she's on a fixed income. This tablet is so good, I'm still surprised at how good a price Best Buy had. Definitely recommend. I might even grab one myself!"
Easy to use and very affodable. My kids love this tablet.
"This tablet is perfect size. Bought for my niece. We both loved the color! Only thing to complain about is there is a lot of ads? Even when you unlock the lock screen. Not sure if there is a way to turn them off? But still, great product!"
"I bought it in best buy for 30 dollars. Its very good except camera. Memory can be expanded. So far, im using it without any issues"
overall its ok just make sure you have a memory card if you have a lot of apps
Not expensive. Easy to use and kids totally love it!
"So this is the seventh or eighth kindle I own. It has a readable and backlit interface that light doesn‚Äôt disrupt. It isn‚Äôt the fastest web browser ever, but it does all things kindle very well. At Christmas prices you really can‚Äôt go wrong with this little tablet. Love!"
I got this for my grandson and he just loves it! Durable and easy to manage.
I am extremely happy with this purchase. I was always looking for the perfect iPad and I found that the Amazon fire 7 wasthe perfect choice.
Luv my Kindle and the free and discounted books. Wouldn't know what to do without it.
Great for someone who never had anything like it before
"I bought this tablet on sale when it was $30! For the price it's excellent! Does everything as expected and a nice bonus is the fact that the screen resolution is very nice and clear. Again, because I purchased it at such a low price it's hard to criticize specs such as the processor. I would have been a fine pick had it been the regular fifty bucks but, in case I didn't mention it already, it was $30"
My son had the 4th generation tablet that came out in 2014 and it gave its last breath a couple days ago. Hes 4 and he likes to through things. But im amazed how long it lasted. This tablet i loved how much cheaper it was compared to the older versions. Other than the size and appearance of it it hasnt changed much. Which i like because it makes it easier for my son that he navigates it exactly like his older one. And i like that it has a memory card slot.
"Had to be a couple of inexpensive tablets for work. It does everything it is supposed to, for a great price."
Unable to fully review as this is a Christmas gift and has not been used yet.
I found this devices battery very poor and also didn't like this device can't support screen share capabilities with my Amazon Fire TV or Smart TV's.
"I wish the tablet was faster and more consistent. It is ok as a first tablet, but not for someone who has owned many and wants to do many things with it."
This was purchased as a gift for my 14 year old who loves to read! She loves it.
This is the perfect Amazon fire tablet for kids and young adults
"Practical table, slow, but enough to do essential things, replace a kindle reader to read by a cheapest price $29"
"Great learning tool for pre school and kindergarteners,also for playing their favorite games"
"Great for Watching sports Events. Facebook, very Fast. Very nice design."
"We love our kindles so much. Each child has one (5), and they use them about daily."
"These are great tablets, especially for the price! The imaging is great and it is easy to use. Hard to beat!"
Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.
"First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
"Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great."
I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
"This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself."
"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
"This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.
"This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations."
I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.
I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.
this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
"I use this tablet to control music on my surround sound home speaker system. It works great for that purpose. Streams directly to the receiver with no lag, and fits perfectly on the wall. Great device for this purpose"
Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.
"Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements."
I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep.
I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it!
We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!
I wanted something small to read books on on the go. This fit the bill perfectly! Not to big and not to small. It does more things than I was expecting!
Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games
Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.
Our 3rd Amazon fire. The battery life is outstanding. Really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery. Nice size.
Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size.
"This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy."
"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.
"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
"This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device."
"The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos."
"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers.
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.
"She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL"
The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
I love my new Fire tablet. Nice backlight helps me to read my E-book in bed. Background color can be changed. I especially like the black background with white lettering; less glare on my eyes while reading.
"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.
Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs.
"I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device
Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.
"Awesome.. Everything I need and more. I'm very happy with the tablet.I'm very happy.Thank you,Kathleen Stroyek"
I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!
The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it
Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!!
Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.
Bought this for my mom who is in her 70's. It's perfect and easy to use for the older generation.
I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!
Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.
Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.
"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
"If you are a Amazon Prime member, this is one of the best tablets to have, awesome!"
So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works
Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.
"After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!
I'm very tough on dishwashers and this one seems to be up to the challenge! I will never own another brand!
My 4 Year old grandson likes to play games and watch movies. This was the best ever purchase I've done.
My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
"Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
"This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends."
"Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
"The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!"
I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.
i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read
"It's a nice upgrade from the 6"" screen. Size is just right for small kids hands. Reading kindle books is much easier."
"Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
Watch it over & over again!!! Blu ray is the best!
This is a great devise for reading books or taking photos. Best Buy Associate was very helpful.
bought for daughter in law and she likes it. she wanted a fire
"It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her."
Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
He and his wife are delighted with it and the acess to the huge number of books available.
I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
"bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective. the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible. comes in 4 different color. was 16gb enough space for kids, has camera, ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids"
"Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer."
Love this kindle excellent price I just carry it everywhere. Fits perfectly in my purse.
I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
"Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices."
Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.
I bought it for my fianc and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
"This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
"My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.
"23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her."
This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.
My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
"This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
"This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.
"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.
A good product that provides the services I desire.
I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
"This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"
Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.
Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.
"Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use."
This tablet is light weight and thin which makes it ideal to hold on my hands. I love it!
"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to download all of her games and apps that she uses to have on the iPad.
"The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process."
"Bought it for my mom, it was real easy to transfer her downloads from her phone to the tablet.."
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
Easy to set up. East tie you. Would highly recommend this product to others
Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too
I am happy to have udated my fire! I love having the camera work the way it should. WAy to use.
I love it. It is so easy to use and great apps to.
I wanted something simple for my Mom to use and this is perfect for her.
It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product
"purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!"
"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price."
This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.
Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.
"My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps"
"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear."
This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
"I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use."
This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.
Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.
I brought to my 2 nices and so far they are enjoy it ....
Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!)
I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.
I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.
"Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!
Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
Easy access to book reader. Love watching my Netflix.Con - Slow getting on Internet.
The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.
"Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."
This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
"My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
"Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast."
"This is an excellent device, however, I did take this back and exchanged it for an 8 which I simply love."
"Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.
I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.
I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
"This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use
"This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version"
"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
Tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet
"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
I needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips. Bought two of these and boy do they deliver!!! The best tablets for this price. The kindle book reader is an added bonus. The finishing is good. My kids love it.
"This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!"
bought it for my son. he likes it. very good alternate to expensive tables out there.
I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.
I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.
This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!
"This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase
You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good
"I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet."
Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.
Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
It's a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it's not what I was thought it's going to be I returned it back just be of this reason
"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
"I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
"convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.
I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
It's great for kids for a cheap iPad alternative however need credit card and no way to prevent accidental purchases
"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!
"I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things."
"Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"
I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.
I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
I'm normally an Apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the Amazon Fire is.
the recipient of this tablet uses it often and loves it so much that I'm buying one for myself.
"Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome"
So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .
"very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
Was looking for something small I could use to get on the Internet and check emails and this is prefect for that
Bought as a gift but have not had any issues with products purchased from you
"I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader."
Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.
Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.
Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew for his birthday. He had been asking for a tablet forever. I made his day! He loves his tablet. All he's does is watch you tube and play games
It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it
I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do...
Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet
"it was good, works pretty easily. the camera is good."
Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
"Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy"
"great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
"Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life"
Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.
I'm very ignorant of tablets. I bought this for my 2 year old and it has a lot to offer.
This item works great and fitst anywhere. I have no complaints...
Great tablet especially for the price it's not an iPad by any means but will run and play a lot of androids apps works off wifi and has a micro ad card reader
"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
"good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for"
Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
Liked the first one so much I bought one for the wife
Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
Nice device I like to use it to read books online.
Kids love it! Great Christmas present even if not an apple product.
Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
"I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK."
"Bought this for my 3rd grader when her school suggested to parents to get a tablet, they use them occasionally in school. This inexpensive one fits the bill just fine."
"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
"I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
"I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes."
"I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.
It's a good device for children because they don't know any better
"It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet"
We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
My son uses the device to help him do his homework
"I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy."
"Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
"Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small."
"The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
Excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at Bestbuy
I bought this to read books on. Excellent for that. Difficult to navigate otherwise
"Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
"Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."
"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.
Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.
Great little tablet once you get the hang of it. I bought this for my wife and she uses it daily without any issues.
It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
"Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics"
The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.
my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.
"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook"
Bought this as a gift.. Good price and features for this Kindle
Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.
"Bought this for my son, it's been through some stuff and still going strong"
My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear
This is a great tablet for the price. Amazon is doing a good job
Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
Enjoy using this product. My granddaughter downloads multiplied games to play and can play them while traveling. Good size and can easily fit into small bag.
My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.
"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
"Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage."
"I am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price"
Excellent little tablet for reading books when you're on the go.
Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.
I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
"Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge."
This is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games.
This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.
This tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users. Not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users
"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It's good if you don't have an ample scope of tasks
Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.
"Good tablet for the price, and excellent for kids."
This tablet is perfect for my six year old's learning apps.
Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
"For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good"
I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.
Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
I got this tablet on a deal and has good quality of video you can watch.
"This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account."
"I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
"For the price you can't beat this little tablet, it does an awesome job!"
I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top
"It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine"
"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
"Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
"We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!
"This is so awesome, I can check my email when I'm not at home, if the place I'm visiting has WIFI. It also plays games! A true multi-tasker!"
Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable
First got the fire stick so the tablet was a great addition.
Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.
Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.
"Great tool for kids, special when you don't need to $$$ to much."
"Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting."
I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.
"I use this all the time for playing games and reading books, it's great for surfing the web too."
It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend.
Like how I was able to buy a version with more memory. Love this works great.
Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
"The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use."
This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun
"I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games."
This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.
Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
"I'm very pleased with my Kindle fire. I've used it more than I thought I would, as I primarily was getting it for reading, but wanted the internet access and ability to review and edit documents, too. In addition to reading more lately than I usually do, I'm also turning my Fire on instead of my desk top computer if I'm only going to use it a short time."
I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
I love this and it's great for kids got it for a early Christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it
"Love my kindle it's the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating"
My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
"I got it just for my son and he can get on and play games and watch videos no problem, the parental controls are amazing and keep him in his specific apps"
"I bought this for my 7 year old, it has endured all that a 7 year old would and could give it."
Bought these for all the grandkids for Christmas. Basic enough for a 10 year old but with enough features and capability for the 18 year old!
Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
"I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money."
"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price."
"I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is ""Mom, you are the best"", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!"
I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.
"I'm enjoying my amazon fire. I've been reading great books, checking my e-mail and shopping.I highly recommend this product..value great quality great.You won't be disappointed."
Bought for my children. Holds plenty of apps. Safe to use with parental controls. Pretty durable but definitely recommend buying a screensaver and case for it.
Great tab for my kids. This is the third fire tablet that we have purchased for our kids.
I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
My son uses his tablet on a daily basis. He makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps. I can also use it and put on parental protections.
"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
"Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy"
I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.
This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.
All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
"My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
Love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what I needed it for great price
screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them."
"Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
"This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc"
I bought this to stream HD music via bluetooth to my stereo. Works great and for the price offered can't be beat.
"Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.
This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.
"If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.
Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!
"Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound."
"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus. Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas
I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.
"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store."
My kids read books play games take pictures they love this.
Step son wanted a tablet and nowadays kids are up to date on technology so the kid friendly tablets weren't enough for him. Perfect for kids when iPads are way too expensive for a first tablet
Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol
Grandkids and adult parents love it. The parents texted and the grandkids play games.
Got it as a gift for my grandma and she loves it!!
"Excellent price for a tablet. Hit for my daughter, she loves it!"
I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day. She absolutely loves it. She uses it everyday. Best thing I ever bought for her.
This is a great tablet for the price! Love the pink color!
Very happy with my purchase. The tablet works amazingly good for the price.
Got this as a gift for s friend that loves to read books! Very convenient and portable. Doesn't heat up to bad either.
I love my amazon fire. This is the best product I've ever bought. I can get any books I want for way cheaper than they are on store.
Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints.
I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
"A great Christmas gift, great for listening to music"
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
Bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself
Bought this for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it. Great price as well.
Bought this tablet for my son. Great price and has great features. Camera quality is not good
easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty
"Gave it to my grandkids (ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
"Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
"I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose."
"Ive always been a kindle fan, you can play games, take pics, read books, listen to music, even go online, and the parental controls make it very easy to protect kids."
"My daughter loves it, except that she can't connect to her chromecast"
My kids love the product. Really durable after drops.
Purchased this for 6 year old boy and couldn't be happier
This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.
This tablet is a good choice for little kids. It is not very expensive and provide nice features for the price. You can beat this!!!
Got for reading Amazon books. Works great. Would recommend.
Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position.
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. Works great.
my son loves it and is easy to use and has parental controls so he can't buy stuff without permission
She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games
My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places
"Small enough to carry every where. When he is using it, you can hear a pin drop."
Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
"Easy for reading, easy to hold - can send emails, takes pictures - must be connected to WIFI to get setup."
Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with.
"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain."
"Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen"
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me
This product is great! It is great for those that enjoy using it for reading but also for entertainment. It is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show.
I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.
links up with up local library. good to read in sunlight. can check web and emails. close to having a tablet but have to figure out what apps work with amazon.
I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them.
I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.
"It has been useful for college looking up information I don't understand and for downloading books. It is also great for downloading apps such as Facebook, messageer, yahoo, google, Google maps, and the weather. It has also been great for downloading games."
I bought this for my step mom who likes playing solitaire. She wore her hand held game out and couldn't find a replacement. She just loves it and can do a lot of other things on it.
We brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to Hawaii. Books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths. Pesky airline and their poundage issues. Now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer. It's a win win but no win for the airlines!
My kids love them. Able to do so many things with it!
Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank
"Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet."
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.
I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!
if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore
"Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc."
"Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift."
This device really allows you to use it for multiple reasons. It's a tablet and kindle all in one. I love this device.
"When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!"
"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.
This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
"Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,"
Bought this for a gift for some one who's old tablet won't work. Just the right size to play games on.
Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology.
"I bought two of these as a birthday gift for my niece and nephew. They absolutely love them. They use it all the time to play games and music. Great deal, great price LOVE ITL:)"
I purchased this as a gift for my mother. Her first tablet and she loves it. Easy for her to navigate.
Purchased as a a present. Girlfriend loves it. Would suggest buying for yourself or a loved one
Bought this as a surprise gift and the recipient loves it!
Bought this for a family member to get her school books on as well as entertainment. She loved it and didn't put it down.
"bought this as a christmas gift for our son, it holds a lot of games and is very easy to use"
I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
Nice gift for the grandson. He will get much use of it! It was nice that it was available in different colors so that he could tell his apart from his sister's.Nice size for traveling with.
"My wife loves reading, and being able to have so many books to choose from is great. The price of the kindle is also great. If you factor in the cost of books. This was a great investment for her."
"My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price."
"Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it. The speed, ease of use and size were perfect for him. He mostly uses it for music, youtube and instagram..all of which seem to work fine on it. It was also very affordable. He's happy with it so we are too."
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
Purchased these for Christmas gifts. Assuming they were satisfactory because I didn't hear of need for returning. Purchased as angel tree gifts for preteens.
"This tablet was a gift for my father-in-law and is his first tablet ever. He is really enjoying getting to know his way around it. It's definitely user friendly and perfect for reading, music, and things like that!"
This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.
Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
The images are crisp and text very easy to read. Apps are good and easy to navigate. Love it.
I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.
Ok so in order to get three working well I needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy. All is great! Kids love them!
Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family.
easy to operate and has good color. use it when out and about.
"I bought the fire because I had heard it was a good tablet. So when I bought it, I was wondering if it lived up to the hype. It does. Its fast and easy to use. I put Netflix on it and watch series I missed. Only downside is that I had to register for a trial of prime."
My son love his kindle! Perfect size and good price
"The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook."
"I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos"
Awesome price on Black Friday! Great tablet for reading and searching the Internet. Has expandable memory slots which is great!
Bought it as a gift for my aunt. She says that she loves it uses it everyday! Does a lot more than her old Kindle.
Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it
Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle
Great product would recommend it this to others. Have a great picture.
"I believe this' a great item, my sister has 1 and we liked it that's what prompt us to get one"
Upgrading from an older version. This kindle is so much faster. Love my new kindle.
Using the Kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable.
This was my brother's first laptop and he loves it.
Easy to use. Like all of the features. Lightweight.
This is my first fire and I love it! It is perfect for taking my books on the go without having the large bulky books!
"Got this for my9 year old so he could play mine craft and other little games. Does well, durable and easy to operate."
Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.
"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.."
Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
"For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse!"
I like the way I can read many books and magazines as well as play various games on my kindle.
Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
I purchased this for raffle prizes and they're great for the price.
Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
"Product was a Christmas gift, to replace and older Kindle Fire"
This is the second one I have Purchased. I purchased the 16 MB version for less than 50.00. As long as you understand it is an Amazon product it a darn good Tablet for the money
"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."
You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.
Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............
"My son has the Hd fire used for last 3 years, I bought this one for my moms birthday. She loves it. It's easy to navigate and the ability to increase the size of the print allows for the smaller screen cheaper price :)"
Awesome tablet. Purchased for kids. They love it..

"Great product. Excellent for small business, kids etc. Good on the go."
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.
I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
Product is great. Plenty storage for lots of books
"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
"The product was for my daughter, she loves it, and plays with it all of the time."
The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.
"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy."
This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times
"This was a great gift for my son. He wanted a reader for e-books and was delighted to have a tablet to search the web, do e-mails, etc"
"We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it."

This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours.
This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours.
"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies""."
bought kindle for my wife she uses it for everything especially reading. loves it.
This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.
I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.
I'VE had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low I knew I wanted to purchase another one. It can be used for a variety of uses.
Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
"Bought one of these two weeks before on Amazon and paid almost double for what Best Buy had these for. So, i bought another one the same day as this!"
Great functionality and quality for the price. I've bought several of these for customer giveaways and have yet to hear a complaint!
"Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too"
This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
"Purchased as a gift, the recipient is very happy and surprised with the performance, thinking of buying another one for myself."
This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.
"The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It's screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket."
The product is very durable and is great for children
This is my second Kindle Fire and I wouldn't be without one. Excellent little device for reading books and playing games. Use it daily to watch Netflix.
I bought this for my daughter who uses it in her AP classes...easier to use a bigger screen than her phone screen in class. She loves it!Price was great!
The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.
Easy to use at home or lunch at the office. The only problem I have is that you have to restart often. Great while using public transportation.
my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.
I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.
"Upgraded my kindle, easy and fast transfer from old to new"
So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.
this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck
Great tablet - good for kids and the whole family!
I bought this as a first time tablet for my mother. She has really learned to use it freely. The color and size are perfect for her. She uses it mainly to search the internet and check her emails. Great starter. I am going to download some books for her to read as she travels.
Was not hard to set up and love the quality. Good screen size and clarity.
"Not the fanciest tablet, but it definitely gets the job done! Bought as a gift for a friend that wanted an e-reader and he loves it!"
Great steelbook for a great movie. this steelbook is amazing
Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.
"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."
"Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7"" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift."
Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.

I bought this because I recently signed up for Amazon Prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books. Nice tablet.
"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong."
I bought this tablet to replace my textbook. It has everything I want and need. I only purchased it after I learned you can download from google play. The amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games.
I bought two of these for two of my children. The parental controls are great and I can easily control their access to content. The ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. This tablet does everything I wanted it to do.
I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!
I had a Kindle Fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. Could not be more pleased with this tablet.
I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
I have already got 2 from Best Buy before this is my third one
"I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader."
"I have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids, in the past, however, the sales associate recommend this tablet, and it was only 10 dollars more. So far, I am really impressed by the difference in quality."
"I love my Amazon Fire tablet, I bought this all the while knowing that people had negative reviews... But honestly I don't know what they did to theirs because mines doesn't have any issues... I've had mines for over a month and still working perfectly like I just bought it yesterday..."
I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt

I replaced another Kindle Fire that was broken after I sat on it! I liked all the Fires that I have had so much that I bought another and it is still in use.
"Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot."
"I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it, so i love it."
The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
"This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore, it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet."
"I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I made a wise purchase"
It's great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it!

"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets."
"I bought this a few weeks ago and use it every day. i've had no problems and it works perfectly! My only complaint is the camera. The pictures are not as clear as I would prefer. All in all though, for the price, I would buy it again!"

My daughter has had this tablet for almost 2 months and it works well.
"I bought this Kindle because I needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 8-5 schedule. And so far, no complaints! Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."
"read the reviews, bought this tablet to replace an e-reader. Way more than I expected. Video was better than reviews stated, books load faster than my old one Still getting used to a new OS but I am very pleased"
This tablet is perfect for travel! Recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on Netflix. Great first tablet!

Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
"This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me."

I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."

"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."
"features are similar to my fire 6 and this upgrade is good. I wish it was lighter in weight, although I enjoy the larger screen."
"Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick."

Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also
You couldn't get a better buy for $59 than the Amazon fire 7. Paid the extra $20 to get the 16gb. Well worth it.
I bought this for reading/listening books. Love the availability to expand the memory. Now I can load movies and tons of books! :-)

I Bought Two Of The Amazon Fire Tablets For My 6 & 8 Year Old And I've Had No Problems With Them. They Don't Have Some Of The Games That You Can Download On An Android Market But Other Then That The Tablets Overall Are Great Especially For Kids Sense They Have a Child's Browsing & Adult Browsing With Parental Locks.
Love this tablet have had several others but this brand works everytime..very happy with my purchase
"It has a clear screen, the books are easy to download, I like the other features as well."
"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great"
I like to watch movies on it. But it doesn't see to connect correctly to WiFi.
just what I was looking for to putin my guest room. It has a good picture
Good size for space I had for the TV. The color is good.
"Replaced a kindle 6 that crashed so fare everything is great. Larger screen fast response,more storage. Don't have to charge as often. Well pleased."
"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
"Great value, just the right size and weight. Suits my needs perfectly. Performs very well. Easy to get accessories to fit."
I purchased this for my husband as a replacement for his old one. He is very hay with it.
The Fire Tablets are by far the best value on the market. They are parent friendly with the parental controls and kid friendly with he ease of use.
This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.
This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.
Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant.
"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
"Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly!"
I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it!
My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work.
My son LOVES it! Easy to use and download books. Requested for his Birthday gift.
The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything.
This was a perfect tablet for my 12 year old. It does everything that she needed it to.
"Really enjoyed this product, books, music, weather, news at my finger tip. A big part of my life. I use at on the train, on my breaks at work, at home."
Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."
I like the price and features of the tablet . Its great in this price
light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images
This tablet operates wonderfully. The size is handy. The graphics vibrant.For the affordable price it is unbeatable :-)
"I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
I bought this for my niece. She uses this for E-books. Better than having to store tons of books in her case.
"Good reader, nice small tablet, charging cord is to short."
"I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product."
"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
Nice size and color. It was easy to grip. very pleased
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it
So I was given a HD for Christmas and when this went on sale in time for Father's Day I had to get it... Love that it has the expansion slot!!!
I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.
The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much
"I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.
My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
"I so love my Amazon fire tabletYou have.everything you want books, games etc. The picture are so clear and beautiful. I can't keep my son off of it . I'm thinking about getting another for him .He love watching videos of his favorite show"
I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here
The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.
This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.
I love the camera quality and secured apps available for download. But if you're looking for specific apps research to see if it's available first. Had to return to get an android tablet for gaming purposes
It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.
It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
"Thrilled with the ease of use, so easy to navigate! I wish I had started with a tablet like this, it would have saved me a lot of frustration."
"I wish I could just say it is one of my best investment, I love the fact that now I don't have to drag around several of my favorite books I can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it I think it's great I should have gotten more memory though"
I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!
"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
Slower that my iPad. Love it. Cheaper and better than my Kindle Paperwhite with much more storage. Also bought 128 micro SD card. Prime member and use it to download free with prime movies
I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
Bought it for my 8 yr old for Christmas and he loved it. I like that some of the apps that come with it can be deleted making more room for apps you would want to add.
I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
"It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it."
Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.
My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!
I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
"Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words."
I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on."
I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation
"I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account."
Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games
Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven't had any problems
We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.
My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
Great price! Kids love it. Lots of space for apps!
I got this to replace my Samsung tablet. I read alot and so i figured that the kindle would be ok to use. I have found that it works great with the books that I read and I really like the Blue Light feature making it easier to fall asleep reading.
It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it
Love this tablet! This is my second. Just couldn't beat the price!!
"The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!"
I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
"Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable
"I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome ."
Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
"Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!"
"Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen."
"I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet!"
I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor.
"Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it."
We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
Any Kindle product I have purchased is easy to use
This product does what it say it do. I really enjoy reading
I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.
It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
"Love this product, and don't know why it took so l"
"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me.
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc√© downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
So far my Fire is working well. I did have difficulty setting it up initially and had to ask a Best Buy tech to help me out. Connecting with my wireless was the most difficult step. The print is easy to read and can be enlarged. It is nice to be able to access e-mail. I find that it is easier to use if placed in a book-style protective case. That makes it easier to hold while reading. Anyone should enjoy using the Fire!
"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load"
for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it
Great device. Travels well. Easy to navigate. Would recommend.
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great
I have always had a kindle fire but I had one that was just overloaded with books and so I bought a new one with more memory. It is awesome and so fast. But also the battery charges very fast and hold a charge for a very long time.
"I have had 4 kindles over the years , got to have one to read my books & relax"
I love my tablet. It is easy to use and it was ready to go when I turned it on.
I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.
I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time
it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price
Love it will recommend it to my friends.Found it to be as good as having a I pad.You can take good photos and face time as well as text.A vary llite tablet that comes in a number of colors.You can also use it out doors because it has a polarizing filter.
Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now!
my dauther loves the tablet and I can get the SD to get more storage and load up all the disney movies that I purchased. it is a great purchase.
Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use
So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.
Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use
The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family.
Wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse. Very easy to use. Would buy again.
We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use
"Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy."
Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.
"battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint."
fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.
"This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps."
I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
"I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone ."
This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to.
"I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them."
I love this product. Perfect size for travel. I take it everywhere. Great for watching videos as well.
"Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
"I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my ""library"" that's not taking up space on my phone."
My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows
"I debated on what tablet/reader to buy and decided on the fire! I have been very pleased with it. Bought it on sale, what a great price!"
bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!
Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
"It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas
Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.
Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
"This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle."
This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.
Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.
Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
"Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect."
Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.
My Fire Kindle is wonderful and I use it all the time.
I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased.
Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.
"I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!!"
"I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it."
"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store."
I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements.
"Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read."
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.
Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.
My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.
was a great purchase. loved the color and the camera feature
I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.
My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.
Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
"This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!"
best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"
My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
"My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at."
"I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them."
This is her second Kindle product. she loves the new colors and bigger screen.
"This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point."
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.
"I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.
Perfect device for gaming apps and on-the-go streaming!
Great tablet. Perfect for my 8 year old son!!!!!!!!!!!
My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air
"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
"She loves it, she has one of the first Kindles and uses it daily, so this new one was a surprise and she enjoys the color in some of the cookbooks. The clarity and the Washington Post was an added feature, and fact that it was so easy to use."
This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.
This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
"Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!"
I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.
"This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable"
"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
"I bought this for my wife, basically just for reading books. She has come to love it. She is constantly reading. Lighting wasn't an issue or I would have gotten the reader.When she isn't reading, I borrow it for puzzle type games, and it is great. Not a iPad by any stretch but it is more convenient than the mini that she also owns. Prior to the Amazon Fire she was reading on the iPhone 6+.a"
"A friend loves hers & told me I would love it, I do"
Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
"This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere."
Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.
My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
I love my new Panasonic phone system. It has 2 handsets which is a good idea for those living with family! I also like the ease of operating the answering machine as well. Thank you Best Buy!
"We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
"Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced"
Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!
My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.
Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy.
nice to have to watch netflexs on in bed and relax.
My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.
loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect
I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done
"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better"
Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again
Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
"When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet."
Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it
I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."
"good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing."
Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
"Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok"
The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.
"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available"
Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage.  Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.

Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store."
Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
I love this tablet. It's the perfect size for my kid. Keeps him entertained during long trips. We picked up the free time kid proof case and it's perfect also.
It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
"Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!"
Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
"Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
"This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
"I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs."
"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."
Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...
It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
So happy with the color choices! This will be perfect for my 10 year old and I am thrilled with thr price!
"I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it."
"Purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. Perfect size. The front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added FB, sharing photos was easy. Amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of Kindle books. There are Amazon ads on the Kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device."
A great tablet for the price--really no major complaints!
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.
Does everything I need and has a long battery life.
"This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy."
"PERFECT SIZE FOR TRAVELING, COMPACT AND LIGHT, AMAZON APPS ARE INCLUDED, GREAT FOR STREAMING VIDEOS AND SHOWS ON THE GO!!!!"
we had an older model from 2012 and it broke so we just replaced with newer one. Love the new features.
I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.
"Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase."
"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !
The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price.
"Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
"So far, so good. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn't anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable."
Good product and the quality of the product is good. Easy to use.
I personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun
"I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
This is my son's 4th kindle. It is reliable but the charging plug area wears out quickly
"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially.
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
For 7 year old. Now has two in different colors - can tell what is on which one by color.
"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
I only bought this as a travel companion when I fly. It was cheap and functional.
The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!
"I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!"
"This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker."
Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
"Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device."
"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
"Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!"
"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
"We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need."
I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues
This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
"I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!"
Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.
I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
Had a kids fire and switched to this with a kids case and tempered glass this time works really well for kids
I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
"Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven't put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!!"
"This is a first for an adult. Price is right, easy to use and just the right size."
I gave it away. It was too nice for me. The person I gave it to was gleeful.
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
"I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
"Great to view movies, play games, surf the net. Makes shopping on Amazon music easy"
I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....
Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.
"Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one."
This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.
"So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books."
This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.
This Fire worked great but I returned it because it was not the one I wantedBest Buy took it back for a full refund with no problems Best Buy is alsome
Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
"It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate"
Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!
"The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy."
"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
"I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music."
Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.
I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.
Upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was 4 years old. So worth it.
My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.
I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
"The best product name on the market,no doubt about it."
I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
"Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games."
It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.
is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks
Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
"Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent."
I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
Gift was on point. Recipient was very pleased. Would recommend to others.
"There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app."
"I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
"I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.
My daughter loves it. She loves the books that she can read.
Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product
"I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod"
"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device
Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.
Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
"I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!"
"I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it"
I love the touch screen aspect still love the original.
"(accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one."
Brother in law loves it. He's not very technical so perfect for him.
My second one and works better than the first one.
"Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself."
Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
"Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great."
"This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet."
"Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!"
Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.
"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.
The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
"I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on."
"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers
"I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn't think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn't need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too!"
Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.
"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading"
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"
"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!"
"I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point."
"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read."
I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
"Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly."
"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.
"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have."
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough."
"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)"
"This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it."
"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels"
"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience."
"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is."
"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.
lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle
"This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier . I couldn't believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere ."
"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs."
Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.
Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking
"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all."
"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.
"Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader."
Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.
This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update
Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader.
"Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it."
"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis."
"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues."
"I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device!"
Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage.
"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!"
"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go."
I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.
"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far."
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against."
"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!"
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.
easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon.
"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.
"I love the kindle, although do then to drop them. Always get the insurance and best buy makes it easy to replace them"
Got this for my dad as a gift. He loved it! Great alternative to an iPad
I love my original Kindle Fire but the size and features on the latest Kindle are a plus
"Easy to setup, easy to use. I've had another tablet, but it wasn't as easy and comfortable to use. For what I bought it for, it's perfect for me. It weighs less than a pound (compared to my other tablet), and I can read what's on the screen easier. Without a manual, the best thing you can do is play with it. I'm still learning this and expect to get rolling on it very soon."
Easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price
I absolutely love my new kindle tablet!! I love the size and feel of it. It has auto blue shade. I can set it for what time I want it to dim.
"I can do everything I need on this tablet while traveling - check my email, browse the internet with the silk browser app, youtube, free app games etc. Because I have an amazon prime account as well, I linked my tablet to it so I can access a huge variety of free music, tv and movies. There are several offline options to load files onto the SD card, or to your tablets memory, so you can watch movies or use it as a mp3 player while away from internet. I watched a 2 hour movie on the airplane and only went through 30% of the battery power. Beautiful screen, loud speakers with the option for headphones. I have no reason to want anything more expensive, such as an ipad or surface since this does all I need while away from home."
"The Amazon fire HD10 is one of the best deals on the market. I've had a IPad and would rather have the HD10! It's what-1/3 of the price of a IPad and just as good, if not better"
"This Kindle in the largest,thinnest yetfastestand most durable. We purchase the geek squad insurance with it kindly. Best decision ever."
"I think the kindle is the best value for the money, this is my third. Each model gets better than the last, I'm loving my 10.1. Comfortable to use does everything I need and beautiful video."
"This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa."
"Gift for my wife, she loves it. Reads on it all the time."
"Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again"
Picture quality is very clear good size to take with me.I wished i would found a cover for this model at the store. Universal model does not work as to I have to take cover off to use camera
Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use
"Love the tablet, not only for reading (upgrade from Kindle) but for searching the Internet, email, etc. And I can take it anywhere. Cheaper than an iPAD and does enough for what I need."
This was a great purchase met needs of 93 old mom in law who needed a large read space for bad eyes
"I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad."
Excellent tablet both for reading books and for going to the web
I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent.
"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8."
"I enjoyed the way the Fire 10 transfered all of my books, games and apps. It only took a little bit of time to go through the start up. The Fire starts up quick and I love the larger screen for reading my books. The colors are brilliant."
Love the bigger screen but do think this Fire HD 10TH runs a little slow. My last Fire HD was not as slow.
Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less.
Kindle products are easy to use and set up. It does most everything the expensive tablets do.
Great table does everything that i need it for. Great resolution and screen for reading books
"I had a 7 inch kindle hd tablet. I wanted a larger screen so I purchased the 10 inch kindle. I am very happy with the device. I surf the web, play some games, read books, and process my email."
"I love the 2 cameras, and the video capabilities. I have set up the picture albums and can even share on Facebook and messenger. I like the side charger. Much better than front.I love the size too."
Purchased as a gift and the owner loves the functionality and size of the tablet.
Grandchild loves the tablet. Easy to set up and child and adult user griendly
I did some research on different types of tablets and this one had what I needed
"The Kindle10 is OK, but a bit confusing to figure out. I do love the larger screen since I need to increase the text size. However, I did find a book that does explain the Kindle10 version on Amazon."
This is a great tablet for the money. The only thing I would like to see is a longer battery life. Otherwise it's perfect
Bought 3 for different and after 3 years mine went kerplot gona get new upgraded one for Christmas this year
Large display makes it easy to use. Very easy to use.
I love my new Kindle!! I would recommend this to everyone!! It has so many features and love the size!!
Got for my 9 year old grandson. Durable & plenty fast for his games. No more squenting to see his ph√≤ne
"very happy. tablet or smart tv for bedroom. movies,news,games and web browsing. great picture and good sound. best product for price."
Use for entertainment only. It works GREAT. Best option for those that don't want to spend so much for an I Pad.
Although not the greatest tablets on the market when compared to Apple or Samsung products but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase!
Very happy with my purchase!! I bought this for my Mom and it was easy for her to navigate and she was able to easily download books and games.
Love the larger screen and picture clarity. It is very easy to use.
"Great tablet, great resolution, very light and fast speed."
Great Tablet.Performs very well so far.Pictures and graphics are of very good quality.
My old tablet died..needed a new fast. This one was alot better than my old one. Clear screen videos look amazing..Sound is better than expected..It was in stock too. Overall very happy item and buying experience!
This is a wonderful tablet. It's lite weight and super simple to use. I bought one for myself and thinking of getting one for my grandmother.
This is my first kindle and I have been very pleased with it for what I payed for it.
"The tablet is fast, clear, and easy to use. Highly recommended!"
"My first tablet. OUTSTANDING for NETFLIX, email, etc."
"very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price"
Great notepad! Huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use. Love it!
"I sometimes find the store a little intimidating, and certainly overwhelming. I don't always know what I want beforehand. My existing Surface failed in far to short a time frame, and since I really only used it to read I was able to replace its functions with a kindle fire, and I am actually much happier with it."
"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy ."
The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.
I've had my kindle fire 7.0 for more than 3 years. it works great but I wanted a bigger screen. I love it.
"I had the smaller version of this & was looking to get rid of it & my google nexus. This is just what I wanted, it uses my Amazon prime account & takes a memory card so I can load it with all my videos I watch while at the gym."
"I LOVE MY KINDLE! I surf the web, take pictures and play games on it. I use it everyday."
"I love the new Kindle fire 10"" HD. I love the large screen to watch movies on."
"I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels"
I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.
"I love this Kindle 10, it is large enough to see very easily and very easy to handle when traveling. I love the size of it."
"I bought this tablet for my wife. She likes the size for reading books and for reading info on the web. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. It also has to be charged often, and that's not even considering time reading books. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle."
Love this product works great so far i would recommend this to others
use it everyday. enjoy reading using the Kindle Fire HD 10.
I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great!
"Bought this tablet a month or so ago and waited to see see how I'd like it. My husband has owned a Zoom and I've owned 2-8 inch Samsungs...this by far is my favorite. (we bought one for him the same time and he loves his too). I use it for email, games, social media, internet and some accounting. I love it. It's fast, reliable, easy to use, easy to see. It seems durable but for extra protection, I bought a shock case with a flip stand on the back so it can be protected and more versatile. My only wish would be that its battery lasted longer for my constant use...but I suppose everyone needs a break every few (2-4) hours. It does charge back up pretty fast.I think its a great tablet!"
"had a problem with my purchase, but Best Buy made it good, they are very good!"
"Love how user friendly the Kindle Fire is, for any age.."
"I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product."
"Upgraded from a 7"" to 10"" Kindle Fire and it is so worth it. Great picture. Good storage. Love my Kindle."
"I love the kindle. I'm not completely happy with the sound quality of the speaker's. And, a month later it already seems to be lagging and freezing a bit. I have one music app, several books, and a few games on it. I don't seem to be using it as much as my 7 during long trips just because of the size."
I absolutely love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. My kids and I can't put it down!
Great tablet! New to me so I have a lot to learn about it's functions.
"I JUST luv my Fire HD Tablet,love playing my games on it,so easy to carry around"
This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2.
"Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet."
My husband is up in years & really enjoys spending time on his Kindle. He had a smaller one & it gave out on him so this one is ideal. He spends hours on it & has hours of fun!!!
This is a great tablet. If you are upgrading like I did all your games can be moved over.
the first one I got was very slow. I turned it in today and this one works great
I don't care for having to close each window separately I would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all
"I love it!! It can do it all!! Beautiful color graphics and in no time at all, I can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel. I love it!!"
Nice phone for the price. Would recommend if on a budget.
I would recommend this tablet because of the value
Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.
"I love the kindle and have had one in one shape or another since they first came out, but I just could not take how slow this model was. I returned it and purchased a Samsung tablet."
Biggest and best Kindle yet. Light as a feather. Buy one today.
"I bought this for a family member because they had the smaller 7"" Amazon Fire. The 10"" version can be held easier in my opinion"
"Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer."
Very good but does not take all aps unless it is related to Amazon. I could not get all the aps I wanted. Good tablet for reading.
"The Fire 10 will do anything that the I Pad will do, and is at a much more attractive price."
Very nice. Easy to use. Got it to use with Amazon prime. Great combo.
"you might find it somewhat short on available apps. My wife has an Android (Samsung) that is quite deep in app selection. That is not to say you can't find suitable choices. Every machine has it's qwerks and the Kindle starts up when you plug it in to charge. Unnecessary. Overall the 10"" is great viewing, especially for the older eyes."
"Great size, easy to use and it has a sleek look that is attractive."
Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase
This is what I have been waiting for. This HD10 Kindle is Super!
"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need."
"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase."
"Bought an IPad and didn't like it. Returned it and got the Fire 10.1. This is my third Fire, love it....no.learning curve."
"I had originally decided to get a kindle instead of an iPad due to the cost. It's a great screen and has good sound, but the battery is pure junk! I should have went with an iPad."
"This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
"Excellent upgrade for my wife's original 7"" 8GB Fire Tablet. Great graphics and very powerful!"
Got this gift as a present for Christmas for my son. He enjoys playing games on it and watching Netflix
This is well worth the money spent and I recommend it. The new upgrades are nice.
The great Best Buy associate helped fit us with the perfect computer for what we need. We love it.
"I bought the Fire HD 8 with 16MB ram on sale for $49.99 ($30 off sale and tax free day). My intent is to use it primarily to surf the internet while on the couch in front of the TV or in bed. If you've been using your cell phone to surf the internet at home this is a great solution for a more comfortable experience.Like others have stated, the Amazon Fire O/S is an Android flavor that Amazon modified and as such you can easily install the Google Playstore which allows you to download most of your favorite apps. You don't have to ""hack"" it to do this and installing the Google Playstore allows you to install the Chrome browser among other things. Basically, the Google apps and the Amazon Fire apps can coexist together so you don't have to remove any of the Amazon content or apps. Install Chrome, Gmail, Youtube, a nicer keyboard app and many Google apps as you like.Also, for those concerned that about the Amazon advertisements that show up ONLY ON THE LOCK SCREEN don't sweat it. No, you don't have to pay Amazon the extra $15 for an ad free lock screen. Simply call Amazon or open up a chat window with an Amazon rep and ask them to kindly remove the advertisements. It takes two minutes for them to do it remotely and apparently Amazon wants you to be a happy customer so they'll gladly do this for free.For $49.99 I'm very happy with the Amazon Fire HD 8. Lastly, I recommend the ZtoTop version of the case, the version with the built in handle that allows you to slide your hand in the backstrap to easily hold it without effort."
I bought my grandson this tablet because it was easy to use and it was at a awesome price.
I love this tablet. Very responsive and fast for a cheap tablet. just the right size! I bought 2 of them! the battery last a long time also! HIGHLY recommend it! It has Alexa built into it also!
"Sharp screen, surprisingly quick web surfing with the Silk browser. Easy to add Google Store (albeit without Amazon's support) so you may add Google apps such as PlayBooks, etc. So you're not really locked into Amazon's ecosystem. The lockscreen ads are only seen for a few moments after you press the standby button and then swipe; so you won't even be tempted to pay Amazon the extra $ to have them remove it (remotely). Very happy."
"What can be said. For the sale price of $50.00 this was a great purchase. Not a high end tablet but for ebooks, movies, email and web browsing I have no complaints."
Gift to my sister and she is loving it. It was a sweet deal!!
"You may be locked into Fire OS, but for 90 of what you do on a tablet it is not a problem."
"I love my new Kindle the screen is great and I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more storage. However, the speaker sounds like mono instead of stereo. The sound is loud and clear but it would have been great if they had a speaker on each side of the Kindle."
"I bought this for my MIL, who loves Kindle and podcasts, but finds it harder to get to her desktop to get online. This tablet has me thinking seriously why I paid nearly 1,000 for an ipad (my 4th). The screen is gorgeous and the setup is easy. Ok, I'll confess, I bought it because of the yellow body--our favorite color and easy to find in a pile of books!"
"While there are many budget tablets out there, not all of them are functional. This one is. If you are part of the Amazon universe this links seamlessly. Book purchases sync without effort. Movies are easy to see on Amazon Prime and you can use Netflix also. Alexa is an added bonus. Not sure the camera will get much use but it is there if you want it. Amazon is slowly opening up their market place to other popular apps so expect more. (Note: I turned off the WiFi and just used this as an e-reader and didn't have to charge it for almost 2 weeks!)"
For the money you can't beat what you get. iPads still rule and are far better when you aren't connected to wifi but given the cost difference I think this is the best andriod to compete with it.
"This tablet is great if you have Amazon Prime. You really cant beat it for the price. I also have the 7"" version."
This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising
While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags. I've watched movies on this from my Amazon prime account and have read my books from my Kindle account and everything works well. It's not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner!
"If it weren't for the limitations of the tablet to just Amazon things, this would've been a great tablet overall.The battery is good, Display is decent for reading."
My grandchildren have mastered the Kindles. They are ages 5-10 and can do anything with them. I have some avid readers and the four have discovered how to play games against each other with each having a kindle. I love this kindle. It was easy to download everything and link to internet.
Gift for Nana. She said it was so easy to set up. Picture is great. Also it is much faster than her older model!
Much better than my older Kindel. This is my third Kindel. They just keep getting better.
"Great product I use at night to watch shows on, play games and listen to music."
I purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law and she loves it!! It is very easy for her to use and read the screen.
I bought this tab for my 5 years old kid.The tab is excellent and my son liked it very much.
"I love the Amazon fire. It is very user friendly. It's great for reading books, streaming music, and watching movies."
"Cannot beat the price for this Fire HD 8inch tablet--just the right size and during Black Friday, it was less than $50. Graphics are superb, tablet very easy to use."
Great value for the price..
We purchased item as a Christmas gift. Was a hit for sure
"Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough? Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my $900 smartphone, $1000 laptop and $500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem. When it is it's very annoying.Screen is meh. It's good enough to not be a bother but coming from a 4k laptop and AMOLED display on my Google pixel XL, the screen is lacking. To the standard user, I don't think it will be noticeable though, and looks pretty good.Case and screen protector selection are sad and limited. Hopefully that changes soon as this tablet was just released this month.Cameras are useless. Not what I bought the tablet for so it didn't bother me one bit, but don't buy it for the cameras, a potato could take better photos.CONCLUSION:So overall I adore this tablet. I use it every day and now that I can have my Google apps and such on it, it is a fully functional Android tablet. It's wonderful, suits my needs, and hasn't disappointed me yet. Highly recommend."
"Unbelievable price. Purchased two, one for myself and gift for grandchild. Shipped and arrived with 3 days!"
It is a great tablet. Especially one to carry around in a backpack because it is also tough. It was a great price on it also.
I love my fire hd I have read four books and play all my games on it.......it is an awesome deal for seventy-nine dollars .......it is a great tablet........like I said I love it ......
"Excellent for the price point. Light weight, good display, connectivity is good, runs pretty smooth, and it's better than getting an iPad and spending hundreds of dollars. This is worth the price and this will be my tablet of preference from now on."
Bought this product for a friend and she loves it. I plan to buy myself one now.
Its very cool great picture good sound. Was kind of disappointed that i couldnt make calls but overall great piece of hardwark
Its good tablet. Cheap and nice items and nice service
It was ready when Target said it would be and the product is outstanding.
Purchased for my god daughter as a gift easy to use would recommend this product for young and old
Use this to watch Netflix instead of my phone. Much larger screen size and battery life is good.
Bought for reading Kindle books. Large selection of books.
"Good product, iPads are great! This idea was a gift and hit a homerun!"
Camera build to be improved.. play store needs more apps
"The product works great, just a little on the small side."
I like the speed and layout. Not a lot of options with the apps. But so far okay.
"This is a good and easy to use tablet, but i returned it because i found it cheaper."
Bought it for my aunt and she loved it she even told me to buy it for her friend
"For $50its a great 8in tablet, quality and speed was not what expected. It's fast and video quality is great"
Love i upgraded from the reg fire tablet big difference. It's great for the price. My son who is 12 now wants one.
"That was for my husband, he really loves this product,watching news,movies and video music.."
This is a very good item.Gets the job done.Works great.
"Not as full featured as an iPad, and not nearly as extensive of an app selection, but great for kids or older parents that really just want to play Candy Crush"
Dad loves it. A little bigger than his last. Way better picture. Good camera. Easy to set up.
Bought this for my wife. Upgrade from fire 7in but now the 8in is in HD. At $50 a steal.
Will be donated for needy kids . Replacing stolen Christmas gifts gathered for St LAWRENCE church Buffalo NY
Came in one piece looks great but haven't used it.
Wanted to upgrade my grandaughter's kindle. I know she will enjoy it as much as her previous one.
"Works great especially if you have Amazon prime and other Amazon devices. Connect all of your Amazon devices to your wifi and suddenly your home just got smarter. The tablet is quick and snappy, and the battery life is astounding! I went about a week straight of 2-3 hours of use before it finally needed charging. Overall I am happy with this purchase!"
"I bought this for my toddler. I love the parental control feature, that way my toddler isn‚Äôt mistakenly purchasing videos or watching what I don‚Äôt want them too."
The tablet works great for basic apps like facebook and candy crush. my father likes how easy it is to use.
"Great first tablet for 6 year old, purchased with a slicone case for protection. Best Buy had great holiday pricing."
My granddaughter loves it. She loves playing the games and downloads books to read. I am so glad I got it for her.
Product is great for a teenager to play games and read books.
"Has a wonderful display and is very dependable. They are on it alot and never complain about stalls and such, they do alot on it from games to reading to watching videos with no problem."
Lots of space for all my kids apps and games theyre gonna love these!!! Cant wait to see their faces!!!
"It doesn't compete with the iPad in terms of screen resolution or performance but for the price it does remarkably well. Battery life is outstanding compared to the 7"" fire. Very pleased with the purchase."
My daughter loves her new tablet. Her and my other daughter we're sharing and Samsung tablet but because in such a fan of Amazon I decided to do research and I ended up getting here this one and she loves it. She even said it has more features than her previous one.
Good portable video /tv access.Able to view my subscription TV live shows when traveling.
Overall good performance. It works fast and comes with many apps
Better cost value than IPads. Tablet is user friendly and convenient. Anyone can use this
Great product that does everything I need it to be
This generation of kindle fire is excellent. The addition of alexa was key.
This is a great tablet. Does everthing and more that a tablet should do.
"Great product. It was easy to set it up and had it running in no time flat. Was a gift for me mom Who is tech challenged, she was using it very quickly."
The Kindle Fire HD was a replacement for a previous generation fire and the improvements are noticeable. Thinner profile and much nicer screen image are immediately noticeable. Video loooks great and the features on the Fire are outstanding for such a low price point. Highly recommended for a basic tablet as compared to far more expensive options.
"Bought for my daughter. Has everything she needs, great value"
Bought this as a gift for my 66 yr old dad. He loves it. Uses it everyday. Easy to learn and navigate. Would highly recommend for an alternative to the expensive ipads.
Bought this for my son and he loves it.I will recommenf this tablet
Easy to to set up & operate very lite weight nice color
Great tablet for simple uses... not an iPad but it performs the base needs
"I love it, excellent tablet, fast, portable, good."
"I love this tablet, amazon did a great job with this one, Alexa is an added plus"
"I was pleasantly surprised by the power and versatility of this tablet, so glad I got the 8"" screen version."
This is a nice size for holding and viewing. I debated on getting the next size up but glad I didn't. You can also create different profiles. I set up a separate profile for my granddaughter and it allowed me to add restrictions so she can't access certain things or make purchases in apps. It also gave me a 30 day free trial for Amazon FreeTime which has so much content just for children. Happy with the price and product.
This tablet is small and practical. Very convenient and fast.
We bought this for our three year old son. He loves it. Plus it has many options for us to keep him from seeing things he shouldn't. The layout is really simple also making it great for children or adults!
This tablet is easy to use and has every app avail
Tablet is easy to use. Wish there were more paper instructions
If you are an Amazon customer and just want a simple tablet this fits the bill and works great. Not an iPad but not $300++ either!
I grabbed this for a friend for christmas. He seems very happy with it
"works great, easy to read, portable, great value for the money"
I had a kindle before purchasing this product. I love the new features and color screen. It is easy to read at night and the filter to remove the blue light eliminates the eye strain. I had it read short stories to me at bed time last night. That is a great feature.
Love these tablets so much. This is the third one I purchased for someone else in the family
"I've owned a couple iPads, three Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and I can without question say that this Fire 8HD is my favorite out of all. The 16Gig version is all you need. Why? Becuase the micro-sd card expands to 256 gig and the programs can be installed to the external drive...saving the valuable internal for the operating system. Samsung should do the same...if they did, I'd probably wouldn't have bought the Fire, but I'm so glad I did!! Love, love, love it!!"
The extra ram makes all the difference regarding speed and responsiveness
"Compared to last years 7' this is a worthy upgrade. More storage and screen size by default. The OS is much more improved on the new hardware and is actually snappy and responsive. My only gripe is the old type connection that kids love to either try force in upside down or break by bending. They should have moved to usb-c. Other than that, great product for the price"
"The reviews are good. It is a Xmas gift, so the person receiving it has not tried it."
Love it! Brought it for a gift for myself.. I'm really enjoying it! Great price too!
I recently purchased the Kindle Fire 8 to replace a lost Kindle HD. The Fire 8 is an excellent upgrade and much better than the HD. The Fire 8 was recommended by one of the Best Buy staff that was very knowledgeable on the product. I highly recommend the Fire 8 and Best Buy
"Very comfortable and easy to use. Has plenty of storage for my usage. I mainly use it for books, internet and old school games( solitair, sodium and crossword puzzles."
I am so happy I bought this. Just enough for surfing and reading. Took it on vacation. Nice to be able to check on things and to get info on the area you are visiting without having to take a laptop. Best purchase. Great price.
"I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Great value, and easy to use!"
Love the fire hd but I returned this for the 32gb.
This is my first kindle or fire or even an ereader but I love it! I can't put it down!
"Bought the Fire 8"" tablet for a birthday gift and my grandson loves it. It was a replacement for his old Apple I pad, what a difference. The price was great, super long battery life, and display screen is incredible. He loves it!"
replaced am earlier version of kindle. not disappointed at all.
"Great product for my kids, hours of entertainment!"
Just love the looks of the products and the pricing was great.
"For reading books, downloading apps and having something convenient to travel with, very good bang for your buck!"
This little tablet has fast speed and a long battery life. A great buy for the money.
The HD tablet is just right for a child who is being introduced to the computer word.
Perfect price with great clarity for a tablet without having to pay a lot like an I-Pad.
Is an awesome tablet with plenty of features that made for a perfect gift.
Good for reading but video quality is not so good.
I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.
"I bought two of these for my kids, and they love them. They are responsive, durable, and inexpensive. Of course, whether it works for you depends on your usage scenario. If you are looking for a full-featured tablet computer to use for content creation, serious research, or other work-related tasks, you should look at an iPad Pro. But if you are looking for a device for games, entertainment, casual reading, and consuming Amazon content, this device works great. If you're looking for something for your kids and don't want to shell out $350 or more for an iPad, I'd strongly recommend checking this Kindle Fire out. We replaced two cracked screen iPads, and my kids haven't missed a beat with these."
"Grandchild is exploring and learning so much, having fun"
She loves it and will use it for many different ways.
I love kindle. Best value for money. Replacing my older model with the 8in. Like that it is expandable as I ran out of space on other one.
This was to replace an earlier gen Kindle. That one would just shut down. We have not had any concerns with this and I will say I like the design better.
"I bought this tablet, so I can watch movies while waiting for my wife when she goes to her doctor, I love the fact that it links up with my Lenovo with no problems.Strong yes to this product"
Worked well as expected. I would recommend this product.
"after downloading the Nook app, I now have both a kindle reader and Nook reader in the same device"
this item is very conv. for the time to read a good book or just to let the book read to you.
"Got this item as a gift, receiver was very happy with it!"
I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.
"The Kindle Fire works well and I enjoy reading on it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems silly to restrict people from reading Nook books on it just because it is a different platform. As a book lover, I like supporting bookstores not only the almighty Amazon. Yes, I know there are ways to get around the restriction. The reason to reduce a point is not based on the excellence of this Kindle, but on politics of sharing."
"Wow, I love my Amazon Fire HD 16 GB in black. It is just the right size, and works perfectly. Loved it so much, I ordered 2 more for my grandchildren, in Marine Blue and Punch Red. I am totally satisfied!"
My granddaughter always wanted to use my Kindle to watch netflix movies on or play games. This way she has her own and we each can enjoy.
"It's great, study enough to hold the beast."
"The best Kindle ever, for me, is still the huge DX that Amazon used to make. But that is ancient history.With the current generation, I have owned the Voyager, and both the new and older versions of the Oasis (for all, wifi and 3g versions). I can tell you from these three devices this 2017 Kindle Oasis is the best and well worth the cost. It is fast, and that seemingly minor screen size bump actually is very big when you use the device to read.Also, the device is very fast. Page flips are very quick and the backlight is even and not distracting.Note that I only read Kindle books on the device. For technical documents the SONY EReader (DPTRP1/B) is probably the go to device, but its considerably more."
"I always use it when i read ebook ,i like it a lot"
"Bought the new Oasis for my wife. She already had the first Oasis and was very pleased with it. What sets this one apart is the 7"" screen. Much easier to see (we are not ""20ish by a longshot) and the battery not being in the case. It feels lighter than the old model but they are very close in actuality. To pay this much money for a tablet without color is only going to be worthwhile if you are an avid reader. Reading on the Kindle eReader is simply much, much easier on the eyes than a regular tablet like an iPad or a Kindle Fire. Not sure what the battery life will be, but reportedly many weeks, and if the old Oasis is any measure that will be true. Build quality is excellent. Aluminum back and not plastic. The leather cover must be purchased separately but is worth it to protect the screen and it looks great. There have been complaints that it does not lock on well, but it appears to be as secure as the previous cover for the Oasis. This case does not carry a battery as the previous generation but the battery in the device is much larger than the previous model. A winner for bookworms!"
I absolutely love this reader. The bigger screen is wonderful. My only complaint is the battery does not last as long as advertised.
I am very pleased with the dog crate. Very sturdy. No damage or flaws. Was better than some others that I have purchased in a retail store.
The price of the item was very good compared to other cages however the item itself came tilted so now my dog has a tilted dog crate. The tilt to the gates are noticeable but not very drastic. For the price I'll live with it.
Purchase this Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition for my 2 year old grand daughter. She can watch her kid's videos now on her own device. She is learning to pick the videos she wants to watch. Her parents love it as well. Now it frees up their smart phones for their use.
"I purchased the 7"" for my son when he was 1.5 years old, that one broke and while waiting for the replacement they came out with a 16gb version which I got him, he loved it. I now just saw the 8"" with stereo and more memory. He is almost 3, and plays a lot of learning games, for numbers letters, puzzles and more. Remember this is for kids, and things like Alexa are not important and I don't want my kid having that option anyway."
"This tablet with the lesser price tag than a appple ipad is far less worry fora 3 yr old to have and own to watch with you while you both are together on the couch at night, a must for a first time tablet owner who has a young child. Who‚Äôs addicted to your own apple tablet."
"I have been wanting to get a tablet for my grandson. However his mother insisted on waiting till he was older. Recently he has been talking a lot more and my daughter said that if I wanted to buy the kids kindle for him. Its a great tool since he has the kindle unlimited free time he has learnered shapes, basic colors, words, puzzles, numbers, sorting, and even sequencing. Money well spent my grandson loves it."

This tablet offers so much fun for what I expected
Was a gift for the children at another home as I have no children.A great suggested gift. He is enjoying it. The grand parents have put some controls on it. A good tablet for the other home.
This is a good product at a great price if you are needing a tablet for web surfing.
every time amazon updates there old to new the devices get better.
Bought one for my mother and sister in law. Easy set up!
"This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
My daughter said she really like her table. She can do her homework and school work on it. Also she do other things on it to.
Great specs and kids zone. Fast and easy to set up and use.
"This was purchased to give as a Christmas gift. It's no iPad, of course, but that's not really the idea. It's a strong performer for the money and, in our case, allowed an Amazon Prime member, who didn't have a tablet, to enjoy some entertainment when traveling or hanging around the house for the first time. Made a great gift, he's very pleased."
"A perfect tablet for kids. The parental controls allow only age appropriate content and are customizable without spending hours digging through the settings. It comes with a 2-year no questions asked ADH warranty from Amazon, making the geek squad protection on this device irrelevant. It also comes with a free, 1-year subscription to amazon kids allowing unlimited access to almost any children‚Äôs show and apps (that are normally paid for)."

"If you get it on a sale, it will be great deal. The tablet itself is simple, but very reliable."
"A perfect device, can be do easily do everything and good for reading tooo."
"The fire fits perfect into my hand. It is easy to navigate thru all the uses. I got hooked on the solitary game, can't put it down! Also,I get books from the library to read on Axis 360. I can get my emails and breaking news."
"After having and using a couple 'cheaper' generic android tablets priced between 50-100$, all I can say is the fire tablet beats them without question in all aspects.. faster, better display, etc etc... We are prime members, so of course it is more geared towards those with prime/etc. However it was easy enuf to side load the play store and get the other apps I need. The generic tabs are getting tosed and I've already purchased a 2nd fire tab"
"I got one for me and my grandma, it's easy enough she doesn't have to call me to figure something out!"
"I wanted a device solely for reading and streaming Netflix, no games or other Internet apps. This device is awesome, easy to use, has great battery life and doesn't have as many update or streaming issues as my last device. I highly recommend."
Very easy for a small child to use. very kid friendly
I purchased for my daughters birthday. She loves it and spends hours playing her favorite games and looking up info for school.
Have enjoyed learning to use touch screan. Reading email from my chair is relaxing and time saving. So easy to use.
I have always been pleased with Amazon Fire Tablets that I have brought in the past. They are fast and never have a problem connecting to the internet like a few others I have had. After trying another 1 this past year I finally decided to go to what worked best and that is the Amazon Fire. Just the best tablet I can always trust.
Got this for my son he loves it. Very easy to use durable and with a two year no questions ask warranty can't beat it

"I purchased my Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 8"" - Tablet - 16GB 7th Generation, 2017 Release - Punch Red a little over 2 months ago to use while traveling from home to projects out of state and found that not only do I use it on the plane to watch movies, I use it to check Email, surf the web, listen to music, play games and just about everything I do on my phone except make calls. It is so easy to use, the picture is amazing and the cost was considerably less what the Galaxy 7"" table cost with all the extras I added into mine. Came with 16GB storage which I quickly expanded to 64 and added a cover to protect it. So far, I love this tablet and am so glad I decided on this over the Galaxy 7"" tablet."
"The HD display is absolutely gorgeous. Charging time is speedy, battery life is extended compared to the older generation tablets, and it's very user-friendly. Easy to learn and enjoyable!"
"Got this on a Black Friday sale for less than $50. It does just about everything. Play games, internet surf, create documents, read books, takes pictures/videos, streams music and movies in HD; it evens talks to you with the Alexa feature. Expandable up to 256gb of memory. Very fast and reliable tablet. For the price, you will find no equal. I haven't even scratched the surface with everything that it can do. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the camera is only a 2mp resolution; which is surprising, considering they bothered to put a HD screen on the tablet."
These new Kindle Fire HD‚Äôs are really impressive. They can do it all.
Bought this for myGirlfriend and she absolutely loves it! It's got built in Alexa also! Don't hesitate! Buy now!
These tablets were a GREAT buy & the kids LOVE them!
"My wife bought the 7"" version for reading. After seeing how easy it was to add movies on an SD card I bought this one for myself."
Good product processor very fast. Screen can get a little smeary from fingerprint.
"Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 7th Generationworking good, loved it."
"Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 7th Generationworking good, loved it."
"Since this was a gift, I have been told that the devise is great and serves as a personal tablet and is very user-friendly and powerful."
"Take your personal assistant with you wherever you go with this Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet featuring Alexa voice-activated cloud service. The slim design of the tablet is easy to handle, and the ample 8-inch screen is ideal for work or play. This Amazon Fire HD 8 features super-sharp high-definition graphics for immersive streaming."
"For start it is a good running tablet for price, does what i need it for!!"
"The 8-inch screen is easy on your eyes, and high-definition technology makes for crystal-clear viewing of streaming movies and television shows. The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet runs up to 12 hours per charge. Very good."
My grandson loves it and uses it all the time. Well worth the money.
The looks and the screen of Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition are good. The navigation is sluggish when compared to apple and Samsung. The touch screen is not very responsive. Camera is not so good. Amazon should have done much better job to make it a better product to compete with Samsung and apple. Hope Amazon makes improvements. The cost is low and appreciate that. I would not recommend to someone who is looking for good product. I cost is the factor you can live with it.
"Got this on great sale, also used some BB points. Typical Amazon stuff, reliable and inexpensive"
everything was as stated on their website. i am very satisfied.
I bought 5 Amazon Fire tablets for Christmas they all loved it! Only problem is I did not get myself one! I got a great deal on Black Friday otherwise no one would have gotten one.
I love it. I would definitely recommend it. I plan to take it on my trip coming up so I can read my books.
I love my Amazon Fire 8 tablet. So easy to download books and movies. Great for trips!
Kids enjoying by using this tablet. It looks so pretty!!
"I love this tablet and so do my children! I have been wanting to get one for a couple years but never had any wifi to use it with all the features, and trust me i bought every other kids tablet there was along the way. My daughter will be 6 this year and this is easily her 10th tablet i got all the ones for kids with the pre loaded apps and learning games. From nabi to samsung kids tablets and everything in between. These are by far the best. Very easy to use and my daughter loves all the games on them she plays for hours and the battery lasts a long time too, all the other tablets battery would die after an hour! This one just keeps going! Even my 2 year old son cant get enough of the books and learning games. I also like that it comes with a free year of free time for kids and if it breaks for any reason within 2 years they will replace it. All the other tablets broke after only a year or less, just stop working or glitch out. Trust me this tablet us worth it! Give it a try! You wont be sorry."
Love my current one hoping this is a little lighter
The daughter was surprised with the speed and ability of the Fire HD 8.She spends a lot of time on it and the battery life is good for the size of it.
"The Kindle Fire HD 8 edition is just like the adult version except it comes withOUT the special offers (ads). It also includes a two-year warranty, one year of FreeTime, a protective case, and can be bought locally at Target. PIN protected accounts can be set up for adults and children. The Kindle Fire is designed to consume content including accessing Amazon services and content. A library of apps, books, music, videos, and more is available at your fingertips! For the kids, content is appropriate for their age level and screen time can be set. It just works! If you want more than that, the additional desired options do not just work out of the box. I am an older, non-traditional college student with children and some difficulty seeing. I prefer to buy my textbooks or check out books from the local library in the Kindle Edition. There are a lot of advantages to eBooks including being able to enlarge the font, multi-media elements, built-in dictionary, ability to extract notes, and some have text-to-speech. There are also no books to return or mail back. The Kindle Edition format works better with the actual reader instead of just the apps on an iPad, iPhone, or even computer--I have all these too. I need to be able to create content too and apps that may not be available through Amazon app store. A quick web search led me to instructions to install the four necessary files to have Google Play on this device (software version 5.6.1.0) with no root needed from a reputable source. I was now able to add the Microsoft Office apps, YouTube, VLC, a virus scanner, and some other favorites through the Google Play app. The SD card can be used for movies or music too for on the go where access to Wi-Fi may not be available. This part was easy. These apps can be copied over to the children's profiles too. It was a bit more complicated to do this because of the number of steps involved, and it takes a little more time and patience. Bluetooth allowed me to connect a keyboard (can add separately or buy a case/keyboard combo like one made by Fintie named Blade X1) and a mouse too turning it into a lightweight, inexpensive, functional, and portable device great for classes or on the go at a fraction of the cost for the least expensive iPad with a case and keyboard. It is no powerhouse tablet though. However, it does work much better than my under-powered netbooks that run Windows. I only installed the essentials and close the apps I am not using. Unless your child is responsible and careful, I think the charging of the device by an adult would eliminate many of the issues I have seen about it."
Tablets are good in use and like the design convenient to use
"The tablet is high quality and with the price under a hundred dollars, it is a great value. The screen size is 8"", which is just right for my use. I can use Alexa on it too."
"I had an old one that lasted forever!! I finally dropped it and it broke (about the zillionth time it had been dropped, egad!). This new one is awesome just like the old one and I love that you can buy colors now! We got blue. My son is busy playing with Alexa, since she wasn't on our previous tablet. :)"
Excellent Product at a Reasonable Price... Best gift for your kid
It‚Äôsadvertisement Everything on your scree but it‚Äô very cheap.
Too many Amazon advertisement that you can‚Äôt get rid of on this tablet. Took my 6 year old a long time to adjust to it as she was familiar with using my Apple Ipad.
Brought for my niece and she enjoys it. She uses it everyday.
the amazon hd 8 tablet is amazing the color is good and battery life is amazing
"This is great tablet for money, it's fast and easy use, Best Buy delivery was fast and product was package well and I will buy again thanks"
Amazon keeping surprising me. Good and not expensive product.
I love my Kindle... It is great for reading my books and browsing the net and such
"Although the Amazon Tablet has come along way from it's humble beginning as e-reader, it still feels like it needs more tweaking if it wants to stay in the ring with heavyweights like Microsoft, Samsung and Apple."
Perfect gift idea. Alexa voice is a plus. Great tablet.
"Bought for my 5year old daughter and it is perfect. You can set two profiles one as parent when has control over what apps can be made on your child's, also many free books instant download that is great for learning to read and even chapter books."
Great tablet for toddlers. Been using it the last week. Put it on the front carseat headrest to keep them distracted while on the road.
"Its great in everyway,, has so.mamy different games and movie choices"
"This was for my granddaughter for her 6th birthday. She had quickly outgrown her other tablet although it was age appropriate. This tablet has enough storage space, especially when you add a micro-SD card, to allow downloading of apps. The operating system also permits downloading, which the earlier tablet did not permit. She is extremely happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet as is evidenced by the amount of time she spends using it."
Nothing further to Comment. Giving as a Xmas gift.
Have a special needs daughter who needs a tablet that is durable along with fun apps she can enjoy without having her mom checking on where she is surfing on the internet. Very entertaining without having her wonder on various apps.
"No surprises there, really decent tablet, exactly as you would expect from Amazon. Nice, clear display, decent performance, suitable for 99% of the people."
Awesome! This product was exactly how it was shown to be. We are very happy with it
Bought as a extra travel tablet and for general use. Very happy with it.
Bought this as a gift for my sister for christmas and she couldn't be happier
Great tablet for everyone! Easy to use and looks amazing.
I‚Äôve purchased a total of 4 tables from Best Buy in the past and thanks to God no issues!!!
My daughter love it I would recommend awesome item
This is awesome to have if you like reading or something to play games on. The battery is awesome on it and I haven't had trouble with it yet. I totally recommend getting it if it's for reading or surfing the internet.
bought on sale. amazing value of device + kids content + 2 year full warranty.one caveat : when traveling outside the USA most of the content does not play.
"An awesome Christmas gift for my 7 year old daughter! Now, she can stop taking mine over, and it will actually be mine again!! I know that this will make her Christmas! Thank you so much!"
We bought two of these for myself and my husband. We both have loaded movies and books on them for entertainment when on the road or boat. Durable and easy to use.
Alexa works best on this device. Even it doesn't run full android system but its good enough for my need. Both pleasure and a bit of work sometimes. Cant beat that price
Awesome upgrade to the kindle line. 16gb with optional card slot. Amazing price and free shipping.
Was iffy at first. But so glad a I got my kids these pads
My sons face lit up the day he saw this and it has been his best friend ever since. I'm so happy we bought this item.

"I am 100% an apple person. I was always hating on Kindles due to them having a very limited AppStore. Once I found out how to get the google play store on the device, I fell in love. The kid version is 100% worth the extra money. It isn‚Äôt just the case that makes it more money, it comes with a year of freetime, which features awesome child appropriate shows, videos and apps. It also includes the two year worry free warranty! It is the only type of tablet I will be purchasing in the future. With iPads, you‚Äôre constantly terrified of them being dropped and cracking. Even if these crack, at least you have the warranty with no ridiculous deductible!"
I bought five of these as Christmas gifts. They were hits with all the recipients! The longer battery life and reasonable price made these tablets the easy choices.
Awesome product for kids who are looking to learn more

I love my Fire. Lightweight and very easy to use!!
"So glad I chose to buy this Kindie on BF. It is still a great price regardless for such a quality product. Made well, feels solid not cheap and chency. I love the blue that I got as well as the other color selections. Great job!"
Great for my Kindle books. 1080p makes movie watching enjoyable.
"Great value. I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old so I needed a tablet that was indestructible. This tablet is extremely durable, fairly quick and the 1 year of Amazon Freetime is nice. You cannot break this tablet especially with the thick foam case that comes with it. If you want a tablet for your little ones that is indestructible, affordable, educational and has great parental features then this is what you are looking for. The only downside is the screen brightness could be a lot brighter."
I bought this tablet as a gift and they really loved it.
I thought this tablet was awesome for the price. The screen was very vivid in its color. I think it was worth the price.
My daughter loves her tablet she takes it every where with her.
My grandchildren loved getting the kindle fire for their birthday. Tons of application and learning application make for hours of fun for the whole family.

"This is an awesome tablet, Got on for my sister as a gift, she LOVES it."
This tablet exceeded my expectations. The price isn‚Äôt too bad either.
This tablet is great. Love the ease of use and the display is vibrant
We have had a number of tablets but non of them have been as user friendly as this one. My son loves it and it is super easy for him to find his apps.

I love this Kindle Fire! It keeps my child occupied and learning and is very lightweight and durable. The protective rubber case that it came with is wonderful and absorbs falls etc. very well. I totally recommend buying one.
"My soon to be wife and I decided to buy the tablet for our nephew for his birthday and he's in love with it. He's able to watch youtube and play games on it, doesn't hiccup or lag at all. A huge plus for me is the protective case it came with. With it being on sale at the time for around $100 for a 32GB tablet - that was a no brainer. Definitely worth every penny."

"This thing is great the display is incredibly sharp. My wife has gone thru 5 tablets and 3 cellphones in the last 2years. She loves the fire hd 8. The battery lasts her all day and she's on it alot. Easily navigated and VERY user-friendly. Would definitely recommend this to family and friends, even complete strangers! The only complaint....screen share or mirroring needs to be included in the features. Otherwise AWESOME TABLET!!!!!!"
My daughter made me buy this tablet and I‚Äôm glad I did
Very simple to use and does everything I need it to....nice XD
I bought this for my wife so she could get internet access and check mail without having to leave the room. She loves it and is totally hooked on it! The price was good as well.
My niece absolutely loves this plus all the in house benefits provided by Amazon u cant lose best bang for your buck when spending on a 12 year old . great for her school and entertainment . Amazon does it again
"This is a good tablet for internet, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu and email. Only complaints are the locked screen wallpaper is an ad and the screen is not as bright as an iPad but a winner for the price."
Our 1 1/2 year old daughter loves this one and she is very delighted with this one

"This tablet has everything you need. Sturdy enough and a very nice (not iPad like... but just what you need) resolution for movies or whatever you'd like to see. There are not may apps on the Amazon store... but my basics for reading, entertaining my son, bed series/movies preview, internet surfing and the baseline apps such as Gmail, Hotmail, banks and so on.... this is a very good product for the price!!!!"
"Use for reading easier to hold than 10"" . Works well for Facebook and surfuring."
A real good device great size screen with a clear picture the price was very reasonable i wil surel use it alot
Gift to my sister and she is loving it. It was a sweet deal!!
Bought this for my 4 yr old grandson. He loves it. Maybe too much!
"Got a fantastic deal on Black Friday. We have owned iPads for years as well as eReaders. My dad used an older Kindle ereader but never one of the family tablets. Even so, I decided for this deal price to get him his own Kindle Fire, as well as the Fire case and a tempered glass screen protector. I got a 64gb micro sd and set it all up with his books and favorite news sites and apps he would use, and re boxed it up as a gift. Well 5 months have passed and he has not put it down! He loves it! He reads his books, surfs and has become a news hound. Suddenly we have all sorts of political discussions haha - good thing we are on the same page for the most part. It‚Äôs great that he reads so much and has this as a hobby now that he is retired. What a fabulous gift this turned out to be. It‚Äôs pretty easy for him to use even though he was used to Apple devices. He rarely has questions and just loves streaming video to the Chromecast, reading the news and has burned through a lot of novels. No complaints. I highly recommend this for the price, compared to my iPad that cost hundreds more."
I love this tablet!! I love that I can set limits for my daughter. She loves the tablet enjoys every single app on it
"Portable, durable, strong battery life and it came with 13k in education programs. Both children are proud and showing do much responsibility by taking care of there tablet. They have designed their own schedule. Am very happy for them both. Best investment ever."
Bestbuy is always on top of any other brands interms of offer and quality of product as always
Best tab at low cost. Best features. Good Amazon apps.
"I give this as many stars as possible, I recently bought this tablet for my kids to share which I can create their own profile with each their own apps. I also have a parent profile which allows me to download apps for my kids which syncs to their profile . I can view which apps they've used and how long they been on the tablet for . I can also time the tablet for them since I don't want them stuck on the tablet all day. It's just like a regular tablet with YouTube and Web . Except it's so much easier for kids to use ! And comes with a kid friendly case ! Think of it like a cellphone that you let your kids borrow while you get things done around the house , except kids probably click on something else by accident and takes them to an ad which kids hate and mostly throw the phone to the floor . Well this tablet shows the apps, movies and books making it easier for kids to handle without worrying about them clicking something else by accident .It also blocks ads from the applications/games and doesn't let them click on tokens you can purchase with debit card etc.. This has such great quality videos! Very fast and a great amount of volume !!! I love this tablet and recommend it to anyone that has kids !!!"
"I bought this tablet for my 3rd grader, she loves it! She will be on it for hours at a time, there's a feature that allows me to put time limits which I love. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes the filtered content doesn't have a lot of options. However, I would buy again."

"These tablets are nearly indestructible! This is my sons second one but his first lasted almost 2 years of falls, throws, spilled drinks, etc. If they can last through my sons rough use then they can last for anyone."
"This tablet was the perfect gift for my husband who didn‚Äôt really need one, but enjoyed getting one as a gift to do things like watch movies and play games on. It‚Äôs the most affordable tablet with the functionalities he needs. No need to spend hundreds of dollars on another tablet that does the same thing!"
"I had the Fire 7 at first but the speakers werent loud enough. Took it back and got the Fire 8.Was a nightmare to try and get the internet to work. Spent 12 hrs trying..gave up and returned it. Got another one and it worked great. The first one had issues. Nice clear screen, very fast and easy to use. The sale price was a super buy for $49 (reg $79).You wouldn't go wrong buying this tablet."
This is the best tablet for the price. If you have amazon prime then it's that much better. Who doesn't use amazon nowadays anyway?
Unlimited no questions asked warranty replacement. It‚Äôs a no brainer for a child!
Wanted a bigger Kindle with color. With the faster speed I can now stream movies too.
"I love my new Kindle the screen is great and I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more storage. However, the speaker sounds like mono instead of stereo. The sound is loud and clear but it would have been great if they had a speaker on each side of the Kindle."
Thanks for delivering on-time because I had to get it fast.
Purchased as an X-mas gift for my 5 y/o son and he definitely loves this tablet. Great built-in parental controls that enable us to control daily usage time and content.
Easy set-up with simple parental control. Nice product at a great price. Bought six of them for gifts. Big hit!
"I was able to upgrade from the 7"" tablet to the 8"" and my kids love it. The best part of it is the durable case! When I went in to the store to exchange it (the SD card slot was no longer picking up the SD card), I took it out of the case and was so surprised at how it had no dents and stuff marks. It looked brand new after 2 years (I purchased a screen protector). Would recommend to kids of any age."
"Definitely takes a few seconds for it to catch up with the user (especially in displaying apps after pressing the home button), but overall a good product for the price."
Great buy for the money! 16 G will work well for business
"Great screen, many free apps and games on Amazon, Kindle reader, and virus protection."
Very happy with this purchase..thw kid has dropped it no less than 39383 times and no screen cracks

I bought this for a gift for my granddaughters and they will love it.
Excellent beginner tablet for kids. Did not have in store and ordering with in store pick up went smooth.
My 8 year old grandson absolutely loves this tablet so glad we purchased it!!!!

She loves it! Very easy to use and a great deal when I bought it.
I like that it can be used as a regular tablet but also have a separate account for my niece where she can‚Äôt get into anything crazy.
"I have always bought nabi's they have lasted for a couple of years with my grandkids This item I bought for my six year old grandson as an upgrade (his nabi lasted 26 months) This broke in two days after giving it to him, It would not charge and the LCD went out . I am now having to jump through hoops to get it replaced ."

"I bought 2 of these tablets for my younger cousins. One of them is a toddler and it was perfect for child friendly and educational apps. The screen is great as well, perfect for viewing downloaded and streamed content."
Excellent tablet for the price. Use it mainly for watching Amazon Prime movies etc. Would not recommend for heavy gaming. Just a fun tablet for the money.
"I got it on a offer. For the price I paid, I'm not complaining. It does its work, not the fastest but it should do it."
Love the ease of using parental controls and adding new programming. And Grandson loves it.

I love this kindle this is just as good as any tablet. I have had several tablets and i would recommend this one over any of them.
Loved this product. Easy to use and so many ways to use. My niece down loaded movies from Netflix to watch on her band trip. Her iPhone runs out of battery so quickly. This battery lasted a round trip and she shared with friends.
Gave to father for Xmas. Was up and running in no time. $50 can't beat it.
"it works well, my only real gripe is that you're limited to the Amazon store for apps and some apps aren't the real provider, but a 3rd party app that is...hokey. Other than that for $50 I can't complain."
"can't beat the price I bought this at from Best Buy. It has held up well inside the beefy case we bought for it, and the screen is nice and sharp. However, the unit did randomly shut off and refuses to power back up without ever coming into contact with water or any drops. I am glad that the replacement plan was very affordable."
Got these for the grandkids for Christmas. They loved them!
"This tablet is great if you have Amazon Prime. You really cant beat it for the price. I also have the 7"" version."
"Amazon Fire tablets are amazing. The best aspect is their price, but the little detail that prevents it from being perfect is the lack of the Google Play Store. Amazon App Store does a good job, but there are some apps that are still unavailable."
I purchased it for nephew loved it was cool. I didn't want to get tablet expensive can break damage. its not easy for kids. I installed google play store worked on Amazon. it did! cool!
Amazon Fire was a cheaper alternative to buying ipad. It works pretty well and served its purpose. My wife enjoys using it.
He is an Apple lover but the fact that you can download things for when you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi is the big winner! He‚Äôs grown to love it !
I got 3 for my kids for Christmas which they have yet to be open but got them on black Friday so the price was right

"Can't wait to give to my son for Christmas! He's going to be so excited, great buy!"
My granddaughter seems very pleased with it. I know little about these things myself . Her parents are tech savy and they are impressed with it.
Purchased 3 as gifts for grandchildren and they are a big hit already.
We bought this for Christmas for our girl. I went to the store but they didn‚Äôt have yellow one which I like the most. I thought the coloer doesn‚Äôt specify girls or boys so we can maybe use for our second one!!!
I‚Äôve used one on multiple occasions. They seem to user friendly so I bought 3 of them for Christmas gifts for my nieces and son.
I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. It was easy working with the employee of Best Buy.
This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising
Purchased Kindled in the past and love their ease of use and size.
Not too bad. More freedom to do what you want. Expandable memory. Way better than the previous version. Major upgrade. Of coarse it‚Äôs not going to be as smooth as an operating system from Apple but for the cost difference you‚Äôre better off going with this.
"I have the Kindle HD7 but wanted something between it and a 10"" tablet.The Bluetooth function lets you use a wireless keyboard, which makes things easier than typing on the screen."
"If you are looking for an easy-to-use tablet, this Fire 8 delivers! I use it for music while working out and it has many other functions that not many people know about. I like to use it as a second monitor while using my computer and I can monitor my house. Since I do not have a smart phone, this helps me out a lot."
This item was for my 5 year old he loves it he's able to rent books from library surf web and play games a parents dream
Well I still haven‚Äôt got the hang it of it. But so far it‚Äôs cool.
"My wife has the Samsung tablet and has better access to games. I can't get the same games on my new Amazon Fire, but in general the quality is top notch - the inability to load apps desired is disappointing."
"Gave this as a Christmas gift to an older woman, very user friendly she loves it"
My 3 year old loves it. Several learning apps and can keep children entertained for several hours
Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. $129.99 and even got a price adjustment once it went it sale.
Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. $129.99 and even got a price adjustment once it went it sale.
This was such a great gift for my daughter! She was so excited to get it! Great screen color and the rubber grip is awesome!
"Great device with more space than previous models. Screen is brilliant and memory is expandable now. Oh yea, and my daughter loves it."
"For the price, you can't beat this tablet it's a little slow, the camera is not great, but otherwise works good. The only thing is that it has ads, that you have to pay $15 to Amazon to remove...."
"Great for the price, lots of functionality.recommend for the avid ebook reader"
Everything worked well and a little faster than the 7 inch but a little harder to hold with one hand. Ended up returning and keeping the 7 inch tablet instead as it was better for me. Still a great deal
While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags. I've watched movies on this from my Amazon prime account and have read my books from my Kindle account and everything works well. It's not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner!
"I bought this for my son and he likes it. It is directed for everything Amazon so no Play Store, etc.. but he does like the fact that it can be locked in landscape and portrait mode."
"Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way"
"Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way"
This was purchased for a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves being able to read her books on the device as well as being able to use Alexa. Very pleased with it.
I bought this tablet coz of its cheap price compared to the other stores.
Everything I needed basic web surfing Netflix hbo.
"I didn't need a tablet all that much but I kind of wanted it to take notes, read some comics and keep some documents on and this does all of this quite well. Skype works great on it and I found decent cheap programs to transcribe handwriting into text."
Bought this to put away for a Christmas gift for someone who loves to read and a side of games bonus. The size is perfect for both. The color is sharp and it does just what I was looking for at a great price.
I bought this tablet to download videos from youtube red and to be able to take the tablet everyone we travel to play the videos. But unfortunately this tablet model does not support youtube red and it definitely doesn't work without wifi. So that was a fail! I'm gonna need to figure out how to download stuff so we can run the tablet without being connected to wifi. Other then that it's good for your little ones older then 3 or 4 years of age. It's big so they might have trouble holding it up but if they sit down with it then all the apps help promotes them to keep engaged and interested to sit still. Great case protector!
"This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I've probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It's going back if they'll take it."
"I'm sure its a great product but there was something wrong with the one I ordered on target.com. My daughter opened it on Christmas morning and was so excited. We went to charge it and it wouldn't turn on. We tried holding the power button down for 40 seconds like the amazon website suggests, nothing, we left it charging for hours and still nothing. Very disappointed."
Love how durable this is. Works fast and makes gameplay fun. Wish Google play was on this.
My three year old daughter loves this. It pairs nicely with our Amazon account and allows her to see our full video library. Storage is expandable. Guaranteed from breakage. Works well as and iPad alternative for the adults too.
Easy to use. Battery life is great. I got this as a gift for someone and have heard nothing but good things about it.
Tablet was easy to setup I was offered free setup but didn't need it.
All of the Amazon apps were preloaded which was a plus. I LOVE the Alexa app. This was helpful when I couldn't find Netflix in the apps.
Bought this for my 1year 7 months he loves it so much
Bought this for my 1year 7 months he loves it so much
Gift for Nana. She said it was so easy to set up. Picture is great. Also it is much faster than her older model!
Got this for my young grandchildren. I choose the fire 7 and not the kids version
"I bought this for my 2 year old since he kept fighting with his sisters over the iPads. This is a great alternative to those and cost much less. 12 months of freetime is great and then prime members get a big discount to continue to the service after the 12 free months. The build quality is great and the free child bumper works great as well. This also comes with a free 2 year warranty from Amazon so you have a piece of mind in case your kid breaks it, which will be hard to do with the included bumper. Great product!"
"Just started to use the tablet and it seems very sturdy, easy to use and does everything I need and more. Considering I am not very tech savvy this product is perfect."
"Purchased for my sister, tablet novice.Easy setup, good screen brightness. Good for Internet browsing. Good beginner tablet"
Very easy to set limits for the kids and the apps are very accessible for them. The sd card slot is a huge bonus.
Works great. Was able to transfer all my books from my old one
Worth the price. Added this to my collection mainly for audible books. Don‚Äôt like the OS much.
"Easy to use but more limited than a more powerful tablet such as a Galaxy or iPad. Video conferencing is rather difficult to do in my experience. However if you read digital books, watch videos, or listen to music it works well and the stereo sound with the larger versions is really nice."
"I love my new Kindle, it's easy to use. It was very easy to get started, I downloaded everything from my old Kindle Fire and was ready to go in a very short amount of time."
nice size tablet with a good protective case that is easy to hold onto
This table this the perfect size.I can carry it any where.
"I must say this is so easy to use and convenient and so portable. If you need to entertain kids during appointments, etc., it would definitely be handy!"
Much better than my older Kindel. This is my third Kindel. They just keep getting better.
Nice to look at. Easy to use. Decent price.sceen has decent resolution.
I love to read but am running out of space to store my books so I decided to try out the kindle. Love it and spend hours reading. I have a Prime account and love getting my free books ever month.
"3 yr old loves it, I hate it. Hours spent download"
"I like so much this item, I will recommend this to my friends"
"The tablet is pretty basic, but there is a lot to be said for that. Excellence in simplicity. Very long battery life. Exceeds my expectations."
Excellent new features and the color is great!! Buy it
"I had been looking for a smaller tablet. The new Fire HD8 is the perfect fit. It's great for media of all types. It's even a pretty good gaming device. But keep your expectations in check. It won't do everything a full laptop can, but it's not supposed to. The screen is terrific, although you may need to download an app for white balance adjustment."
I WAS LOOKING FOR A TABLET FOR MY GRAN DAUGHTER AND FOUND THIS
My girlfriend loves using this product. She uses it every day.
Nice size screen. Very clear picture. The blue color tablet looks very nice. Overall satisfied.
"The item is excellent, the price, the store, and the agents that assisted me"
"The item was excellent ,best price,best cost and best store"
This is a perfect tablet for kids between age of 4-12 if you have amazon prime you can download games for free also is good for traveling.
"This is a very nice tablet. Screen size is sufficient, ample storage, and sound is very good. Would buy again."
"Great tablet for toddlers, price is very affordable and it design gets a feeling of unbreakable hard tablet."
"Crisp color, great performance, with all the great apps. Excellent for reading with the reduced glare feature. The screen size and HD clarity makes it optimal for viewing shows and movies."
"I was contemplating if I should me buy the regular tablet or the specific one for kids. And I recommend if it's going to be used by kids a lot, better buy the kids version. You get 1 year subscription of unlimited entertainment and learning stuff and many of the best stuff is already available. No need to go to the app site and think of what to download. It's a major benefit."

This tablet is adicting and easy to youse incredibly fast clear screen in any light and is so easy to order and return books i never have to go to a book store
"This is an excellent tablet for children and adults. Runs great and looks fine. While it may not pack the punch that newer iPads and Android Tablets do, the Amazon Fire HD does everything you expect it to. Bought one for my daughter and she absolutely loves it."
We chose this tablet specifically for the parental controls and it does not disappoint. I really appreciate the fact that I don't have to worry about the kids getting into and changing settings or coming across inappropriate content. Normally we choose apple products so I was a little worried about this platform but I'm thrilled with this purchase.
Best Kindle Fire I have ever had and this is my fourth one. Had a regular Kindle when they first came out. Upgraded to a Fire 7 and now to the Fire 8.
We were shopping for a tablet for our 7 year-old daughter. We checked out numerous tablets but ultimately chose the Kindle based on the ability to control it very easily.
I had been looking at the Fire tablet for quite some time and at the price I just could not pass it up.
"Bought this for trip, works great long battery life with lots of apps for the kids."
"Bought this for trip, works great long battery life with lots of apps for the kids."
"I have 3 other kindle tablets for my grandkids. Got this one for my mom, but she decided not to keep it, so I have it. It's excellent as a book and as a tablet. I especially like the blue screen feature, which cuts down greatly on eye strain."
I read a lot of digital comic books and graphic novels. I wanted to get a cheap tablet just for that purpose.it does a wonderful job
Great app selection. Parental controls are easy to set up to prevent unwanted purchases. The fact that the bumper is already included is a plus and protects it well.
I enjoy shopping at best buy stores. Best buy has the best prices and quality of merchandise.
"I love Best Buy; I wouldn't think of going elsewhere for my electronics. I don't believe their prices can be beat, and they stand behind their products."
"Easy, friendly features that allows for uncomplicated use and function."
Amazon Fire Tablet is a top tier product. Must buy
"I love the Fire tablets. They are cheap and very high-quality products! Great battery life, High Definition, and also could expand the memory storage."
"Purchased 4 of these tablets as Xmas gifts and the interface is perfect.What a great deal for $50 8gig version.Wife was so intrigued by Alexa voice,now she wants one.The best tablet deal I ever purchased."
This is the second tablet I have purchased (the latest is a gift for a family member). These tablets are great and you cannot beat the price. I use mine daily and it goes every where with me. I highly recommend purchasing one.
"This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review."
I bought two of these tablets for my kids as Christmas presents. They had older Kindle tablets and the Black Friday price was too good to pass up. They seem to be faster and the display is much brighter than their older devices.
This tablet is definitely worth every dollar. Extremely well priced and very easy to use and download items or apps.
This is a great tablet for the price. Only caveat is the amazon ads that come with it.
You won‚Äôt get a better one at this price and it makes it more compelling with the built in Alexa voice assistant.
"Since I bought this tablet, I have not been able to find any major faults with it at all! Its 8"" display allows it to be quite portable while allowing the screen to be large enough for me to watch movies on it. The device has a Micro SD port on the side, which allows you to extend its internal memory. One slight disadvantage is that it runs on Fire OS 5, and although it is a variant of Android, you are limited to the apps available for download and installation through Amazon's Appstore as the Google Play Store app is not present on the tablet."
"I love the Amazon fire. It is very user friendly. It's great for reading books, streaming music, and watching movies."
Upgraded after older version slowed. Excellent graphics and speed. Look forward to learning more about newer features.
"I bought this as a book reader but found that it does so much more that I find myself using it everywhere. the price of this unit is lower because of the startup ads but that is not an issue at all. when you turn it on the ""swipe to start"" screen is an ad instead of just a blank screen, so what? it's targeted advertising and some are quite interesting."
Great item and a great price. A gift for my sister that I'm sure she will enjoy
"Decent tablet for the price it offers, good deal I‚Äôd say."
"Received the Amazon Fire HD8 and it works well, BUT it is clogged up with constant ads. I had to contact Amazon to turn them off, at an additional cost of $15+tax.. When promoting this item at this price, it should have a notice that the price is discounted by the inclusion of constant ads!"
We have been long time uses of Kindles. This new Kindle fire replaced one I've had for years. And I gotta say I love the new apps it's been upgraded with! There's more we can do with it and I use it daily. My son has the free time kid's membership for $3/month for age appropriate content.
After I learned how to use the Fire it is fantastic. Easy to use and fun.
"Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough? Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my $900 smartphone, $1000 laptop and $500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem. When it is it's very annoying.Screen is meh. It's good enough to not be a bother but coming from a 4k laptop and AMOLED display on my Google pixel XL, the screen is lacking. To the standard user, I don't think it will be noticeable though, and looks pretty good.Case and screen protector selection are sad and limited. Hopefully that changes soon as this tablet was just released this month.Cameras are useless. Not what I bought the tablet for so it didn't bother me one bit, but don't buy it for the cameras, a potato could take better photos.CONCLUSION:So overall I adore this tablet. I use it every day and now that I can have my Google apps and such on it, it is a fully functional Android tablet. It's wonderful, suits my needs, and hasn't disappointed me yet. Highly recommend."
"This little tablet was purchased during a moment of weakness. I really wanted a Kindle reader. But this has exceeded my needs for a fraction of the price. I can read and listen to books PLUS a ton of other things (including browse on wifi). The ""offers"" show as lock screens and notifications and can be ignored or dismissed easily and make the device price of under $50 (during a promo) very reasonable! Speed is decent, storage upgradable with MicroSD, and feels like a book in a folio-style case. PERFECT! Note: I have other higher-end productivity tablet devices, also. This WILL NOT replace them or do all they can do. Entertainment, internet browsing and leisure is what this was purchased for and I'm pleased."
Had to have my son set up the tablet took about 30 mins
This is really easy to use no complications so far and it's really fast.
It is a great buy. Nice quality.Enjoy playing music and emailing at the sametime.
"Good price for the buy , I use it mostly to play games. Only downside is Amazon app store doesn't have as many games as Google play. And you can't get Google chrome app either."
It already quit working. Will not charge anymore. I had to buy a new one.
This fire was for my 78 year old grandfather-in-law. He loves it. He can see it. It's easy to use!
Fast inexpensive tablet. Great deal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This is a great tool for both listening to music and for reading, as well as watching videos. I think it's a great improvement on the 7 just in terms of screen size and handling. Very easy to set up and use."
"It's a great tablet for my grandson. it has plenty of storage for his favorite games and books. I also enjoy the parental settings, so that I can see everything he is doing and set time limits for him. Overall it was a great buyand the pricing way awesome!"
"Great unit . Computer died so I got this , works great . Does everything I need . Need to set up remote printer app. Yet"
Screen size is perfect and it does everything I/we need it to do.
Bought this for my son so he could watch some shows that way download so far so good great product
I love my fire hd I have read four books and play all my games on it.......it is an awesome deal for seventy-nine dollars .......it is a great tablet........like I said I love it ......
Bought this for our 3.5 year old grandson. So far so good! Loves it!
I'm really impressed with Amazon products my son really happy..

This was the best deal ever and it also came with antivirus service.
"So my son broke my (his) old Samsung tablet that he'd been using for himself since his older brother had an iPad. I immediately thought of the fire kids edition and knew it would be good for him since it's still Android and since it's a very simple fix to get all of his favorite apps on it. A word of advice: Fire OS is very limited, but with a few downloads you can easily bypass the fire OS launcher and even install google services. Battery life is very good, and with the included case now I'm not afraid of another accidental drop. It can handle any of his kids games and with both the Amazon app store AND the play store the possibilities are endless."

My husband loves the tablet it works great and I bought it for him
I really like my fire tablet. I bought my Mom one when her kindle was acting up and not working. I bought myself one and really like it for the price. It's not expensive and works great. I use mine mainly to read on and added more storage to it.
"I wanted a device to browse content in a screen bigger than a smart phone, read e books and watch videos. Being cheaper, coming from a renowned brand, the latest 2017 Fire HD 8 had improved screen, memory, battery compared to its predecessor. Also, I found a way to install Google play store and use this as a normal Android tablet. Here's the link - https://www.howtogeek.com/232726/how-to-install-the-google-play-store-on-your-amazon-fire-tablet/.The device runs smoothly so far after installing all my fav apps."
"Love this tablet. I bought it while it was on sale 99 as a Christmas present for my 4 year old. Plus with my red card i saved an additional 5.. It is so nice and easy to use. I love the case it comes in too! My other son has an iPad mini I added to my phone plan, and i like this way better. It comes with apps, books, games and movies and is educational as well as fun. Very happy with this purchase would definitely recommend."
Easy to use for kids as a beginner. Plus it's already got a case on it!

"It very light, great display and very easy to use."
If you love all things amazon then this is for you!
It does everything well. Easy to use and a great size. This is my first tablet and I made a very good choice.
My daughter loves it! Easy to use and long battery life.
Great tablet for the price. Got this for a present and love it
Home screen and videos are confusing.But it works great.Love it.
Home screen and videos are confusing.But it works great.Love it.
My brother and I are having so much fun with this!
Purchased this for my son to carry to class instead of laptop. This has been much more convenient and enable him to utilize online textbooks instead of purchasing/renting expensive course material.
Gave it as a gift to my mom for Christmas. She‚Äôs not into new tech. But after three weeks she loves it!
The purchase of this tablet is sufficient for my granddaughters needs
The purchase of this tablet is sufficient for my granddaughters needs
These were bought as gifts for elementary age kids. It is a great tablet which also gives the kids ability to download books to the Kindle app.
This little tablet gets the job done. Plenty of functionality. Attractive and priced right.
This was purchased as a gift so I can only offer an average expectation of its performance.
She loved it! Perfect for viewing movies and playing games!
Easy to use. Gift for 86 year old mom who loves to read. She needed a bigger screen. Will enjoy other abilities of tablet.
Great!! Replaced older Kindle. Much better version!
"My girlfriend has been wanting an e-reader for a while now. She reads rather quickly, so she wants to have the option of taking more than one book with her. Got her this, loaded up her Amazon library, and she hadn't put the thing down. She says the screen is the perfect size for reading, and the option to use a black background with white text has been really easy on her eyes. Even at full price, I'd have called this a win. On sale, I call this total victory."
"The price was good for this product, however we have gone through 3 of the previous models with varying issues."
I just set them up but they seem great and easy to use. I'm planning on given it as a gift to my father and I don't forsee any problems
Bought for web surfing on the couch and watching movies when traveling. Works good and looks good. Appstore not as good as apple or android but that is ok for my use. Price is good on sale.
Excellent product would recommend it to all of my friends
Good compact size great display stable OS audio is good very limited apps
Great price for this item. Gave it as a gift and our daughter said it was easy to set up. And the letters are crisp and clear. Had to order it online but your store got it in a reasonable time period!
Is great value for the price. Quality is good. I like that is not heavy.
It is good product I will till my friend about it good
it is worth the money. best bang for buck you cant go wrong with it
"It's a good device to surf on the internet but you can't install some Android apps like Chrome, and the camera is horrible. I would recommend it for readers because you can use Hoopla, and that's amazing."
"My daughter loved her new tablet.. it was, what we expected."
"My daughter loved her new tablet.. it was, what we expected."
"Pretty cool tablet for the price, pick it up when its on sale"
"Was considering a Kindle but decided to get the 8"" fire table to get some Android apps, Internet and a larger screen for reading.The experience had been descent and battery life enough to use all day."
My son loved his amazon fire HD 8 great for game and books to read
"Bought during Black Friday specials to test out for parents. It's not an iPad, but it works well for the casual tablet user."
"Easy to use, good quality for a simple tablet, good price"
Bought this for my my daughter. Good for slower games. Kind of slow loading pages and when watching videos
"The device is awesome! I bought it for my 6 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. The only problem I have with this fire and the older version that I also own is the poor selection of apps and games that Amazon offers. To get the better apps and games, I have to load Google play store onto it."
I bought 2 for my kids and got a great discount but the one my daughter uses has gave us a little trouble from the start
I share the table wit my grandson and we both love all that it can do. I am reading more than ever now and he is playing more games because this tablet has so much more to offer.
My nephew is so happy to have his own tablet. Works pretty good.
I can‚Äôt find earphones for my Amazon fire 7th.xxxx
"After reading several reviews I decided to order the tablet and I would like to say I made a Great Purchase! This is a great tablet for the price. Its a nice quality and you can do anything you can do in an Ipad. The camera quality isnt the best but it is acceptable, especially for the price. I would buy again!"
It is what it is good value for cheap tablet. This was a gift purchase
No problem till now.Number one choice for frequent use in the low segment device.
I think the price was great for the Kindle. Perfect gift for Xmas.
"I purchased on a one day sale for $50, mainly to have an extra tablet laying around for quick access to the web. Found it very useful to work with Amazon shopping and other apps, as well as Alexa/ Screen colorful and sharp, plays movies full screen with only a 2Gbs download wifi connection. Customizing this device has made it much more a true android tablet and so far it's great. Some things still cannot be done vs conventional Android tablets, otherwise would have given 5 stars rather than 4. Highly recommended for the price."
"Great for in the car, restaurant, or doctor appointments!"
"I bought this tablet originally because of its price. You get what you pay for. Overall, I thought it was a wonderful tablet but it didn‚Äôt fit my needs. I ended up returning it because I didn‚Äôt like the android software. This tablet is wonderful for children and the elderly, but for a previous iPad owner, I decided to buy an iPad and pay more instead."
"Good device for reading and watching YouTube, Netflix, and shopping. Not so much functional as a tablet."
Basic tablet which is pretty good for its price range.
"Bought for my 5 year old. He loves it. Not a great camera, but has a lot of fun options. Love Alexa!!"
"Bought it for my nephew, loved it, use it all the time...."
"Comparing all other tablets, this one is really good for my kids. User friendly interface and tons of educational apps"
Excellent processing speed and best for kids.we can download and stream videos apps and can lock the contents that are not needed
"Good for kids, it‚Äôs no iPad but can‚Äôt beat it for the price"
"Good for kids, it‚Äôs no iPad but can‚Äôt beat it for the price"
"Great tablet, durable and good price. Bought it for our son for Xmas and he loves it!"
I bought for my 5 year old. Easy for her to use. Easy for me to track and control screen time.
I purchase this for my granddaughter of 9 months. Love the games
Bought for my 4 year old very easy for him to use and has good parental controls.
"I picked up the Fire tablet on a whim when it was on sale at a low price as a backup for traveling and for the kids to use, and make use of streaming services since we have a Prime account. I liked getting a larger screen at a low price. The wifi reception isn't that great, and the touch sensitivity isn't near what I get on the Samsung tablets, but for the price, I'm fine with it, provided that it holds up."
Prices are very reasonable better than other tablet
"I bought this for reading books and was quite pleased to find out I could access books my husband ordered through Amazon Prime. I do have a couple complaints. One is it seems that every time I charge the Kindle something changes. The first time I charged it, some new icon appeared on the home page. The last time I charged it my book library completely changed. I had the hardest time trying to find the book I had been reading. Instead of listing it at the top of the screen, I found it several sections down. It would be nice if I could click on the book link and have my current book load, but if that's not possible, I wish I didn't have to now go looking for it."
"Bought this to replace my aging Nexus 7 (2013) version, but didn't hold a candle up to it. I knew it going in, but wanted to see for myself in person. For $80, can't hardly beat the features, but I was spoiled by arguably the best small Android tablet ever made. I knew the screen resolution was lacking, especially on an 8"" screen, but coming from the Nexus, it was a huge difference. Also, even at 4 plus years old, the processor was humming along smoothly. The extra .5 gb ram was also helpful. Anyways, back to the Fire HD 8. One advantage it had over the Nexus, was the expansion slot. I loved being able to put my media on it, but then again, the media displayed on the screen was subpar, so it's a wash. I installed Google play on it, so that it expanded its functionality, and I'm an avid Amazon conneseiur, but found the table too limiting. Ultimately returned and bought an old, discontinued Fire HD 6 for $20. The resolution almost matches that of the Nexus, so I'm happy for now."
"It's a fast tablet, but doesn't get all the games you can get at the play store. Many apps not available for Kindle."
Bought it for my daughter and she loves it. The picture quality is good
"I am happy with this product, it works well and it is affordable. The only complaint is the charge input seems a bit weak"
This is great for kids and for the price. However they don‚Äôt last that long. If you know that ahead of time you won‚Äôt be disappointed
This was a xmas gift and is a great gift for someone who uses kindle and Amazon.
Easy to use even for my 3 yr old happy with how it has a lot of apps that are free same as Android to download. Good deal for the price. My son loves it.

using for games and reading outside of the home. works good.
The only problem I have with this is slow boot up time
I went in looking for an inexpensive tablet to use while I work out. It is a nice size for watching video or reading. I actually broke the first one while lifting weights so I went back and bought another one.
"Good first use tablet, good option tongift to small kids. Works well"
Camera build to be improved.. play store needs more apps
Good price and good quality. This is one of the best for this price
This is my second kindle fire. It is much improved over the last one. Very easy to use. Especially like the Alexa feature.
"My sons first table since school is using apps now for supplemental math. He loves it and the child controls are great. Performance is solid, particularly for a grade school kid. The case and price point make this a great buy."
"My sons first table since school is using apps now for supplemental math. He loves it and the child controls are great. Performance is solid, particularly for a grade school kid. The case and price point make this a great buy."
Decent tablet to give to someone without a hefty price tag
For the price I believe this is an excellent tablet .
Good product. I love mines so I brought my husband one for Christmas. He‚Äôs always taking mines.
Replacement tablet for my 6 yr old after she accidentally shattered the screen. We have been VERY happy with our kindle tablets
"This tablet is not as good as ipad when watch video, but good enought to view webpage and ebooks. I'm satisfied."
"Good product and excellent price. Fast shipping.Got it at 49% on Black Friday deals.Using it as Photo Frame 24/7.Put more than 10,000 photo to Micro SD."
"Good product, top notch service, always easy to purchase, multiple delivery options."
Great quality for kids very fun very durable great warranty gave 4 stars because it could be easier to download shows and such but once I learned (not very tech savvy) it's easy.
Bought a kindle for my Son almost 4 years ago and it‚Äôs still works like a charm. Bought this one for my Mom for Christmas and she can‚Äôt stay off of it. It‚Äôs safe to say that the Kindle is a great product
Nice product with a nice screen for easy reading. Like the color chooses
Easy to set up. Haven't tried all the features yet. Like the reading ability. Easy to hold in your hand. Wanted to find a screen protector though and the market is geared toward Apple users.
"With the recent promotion for the Amazon Fire HD8 tablet, I just had to get one. It's been a while since I bought a tablet and the one I currently have is getting to be very slow.The tablet will come with a micro USB charging/data cable and a wall adapter.The tablet itself has some weight to it compared to the kindle tablets but won't be a problem if you use it to read sitting up. Initial setup was very straight forward. Once you connect to the WiFi and login to your Amazon account, you should be in the FireOS interface. The tablet is bundled with Amazon apps so everything is just a few swipes away on the screen. The interface itself, is very smooth so I didn't notice any lags at all. I did try a few games and there were some that were a bit slow at times and this was expected from a tablet at this price range. I will mainly use it to browse online and watch videos so don't see this as a huge setback.The buttons, charging port and headphone jack are all on top which will need some getting used to since most devices I've used had side buttons for the power/volume and charging/headphone ports are at the bottom. To the left side are two speakers and there's a micro SD card slot on the right for those who need more memory. The memory card option will be handy since this tablet is only 16GB and I think you have about 11-12GB free out of the box."
"Very compact speaker, so it's easy to transport. I like that it's also waterproof. I wish it had music controls on the speaker beyond just the volume.....didn't think about it when I bought it though. Still, very high quality."
Got it for my brother. He uses it to face time great grandkids with my parents. They love seeing their little faces. Easy start up for non techie people.
"We purchased the Fire for our 9 year old. The price is right for an entry level device and I don't worry too much about it breaking. The charging port has already started to fail, however."
"Works very well, great value. I would highly recommend."
"I like the size and quick connection, but sometimes App store can't find the items I look for."
The tablet is the same as the adult version and can be used as such until ypu activate a child profile and tou can switch between profiles making it very useful
Bought this for my youngest daughter to have movies to watch on long car rides. Works great. Fast. Nice bright screen. The SD card addition is wonderful so more apps can be added and Netlfix movies can be downloaded.
Bought this tablet for my daughter to read books. But it also was able to play videos that came with her new guitar. GREAT! A good Christmas surprise for the both of us. My daughter LOVES this tablet.
Gave as a Christmas because of the good sale price and could get them quicker than ordering from Amazon
Good tablet nice color woeks well good screen size
Got it at a really good price from bestbuy. Overall really good for the price i paid
I bought this tablet for my daughters 8th birthday to replace her older kindle fire. Works great and the customer service was the best I have ever received.
I was looking for a cheap tablet that ran a lot of Android apps. This was perfect.
It works great for what I got it for. It works great with our Alexa products and as a basic tablet.
My 3 years old son love this tablet. It's hold charge for hours. Only problem Amazon dose not have YouTube app.
"This is a good tablet for the price, nice change from using phone"
This was not the best choice for my autistic son. We were unable to download anything from Google Play and were limited to the Amazon store. Making this a deal breaker for us. I had to return it and get a different tablet.
Available decent 8 inch options out there are a bit pricey. 7 inch is little small. Fire HD8 fits the bill and is just right at a great price!
Works good not as fast but great colors and sounds
I bought it for my son for Christmas. I love it. It's much bigger and sturdier than the other Kindle Fires. The font is bigger and much easier to read. It also holds a charge well.
This is a quick and responsive tablet. Apps are limited to The Amazon store for the most part so it's important to make sure the apps you want are both available on Amazon and compatible with this tablet.
Bought it for my aunt and she loved it she even told me to buy it for her friend
My kid loves this Kindle Fire. It keeps my child occupied and learning and is very lightweight and durable.
Bought this as Christmas gift for son. Good value for money and ease of use.
Good value for that money. Maybe only bad thing takes a while for charging.
Got this tablet for my 1 yo baby. Easy to use and drop resistant. LOVE the cover it came with
"Good size to hold while just lounging on the couch or in bed. The tablet does everything I need it to, good for the money!"
"So this tablet offers a lot for the price. It's reliable, has a quality screen, good performance (no lag when swiping screen or opening apps), and good battery life. It doesn't feel fragile despite being made of plastic.The only thing I would do different is add GPS capability."
If you want a cheap tablet that won‚Äôt break the bank this is the one for you. I use this tablet to play music though my Bluetooth speaker while working out.
"This is a pretty good tablet for kids, but the sound is way to low. Very difficult to hear."
"This is a pretty good tablet for kids, but the sound is way to low. Very difficult to hear."
"Bought couples during holiday season at low price ($50/ea), nice!Pros:- HD display + Fast internet, smooth streamming- Can add more storage by using microSD card- Good size to carry & reading document on the road or worksCons:- No AGPS (but not big deal)- No Google Play Store (but you can side load Google Play. Many instructions available on web)"
Bought on black friday sale. Good tablet for the price
"Although this was a good value for the money, I personally found that the 7"" Fire (which was not HD) had just as good of picture quality and for half the amount, ended up being the better deal, so I returned this one."
"It's very good tablet for < $100, fast and light, good for everyday use and bring along for travel."
"I got this little tablet to carry around with me because it fits in my purse. I like it for what I got it to do - have something to read all the time, but it's REALLY slow. So if you're impatient and don't want to wait for apps to load, don't get this!"
"If you are getting this, get it on a sale!!It slow and choppy, but it's decent for light media consumption and browsing."
The third Amazon tablet I've had and they are all magnificent. And they're always upgrading the item. Happy.
"Good product and excellent price. Fast shipping.Got it at 49 on Best Buy on Black Friday deals.Using it as Photo Frame 24/7.Put more than 10,000 photo to Micro SD."
i had the Amazon Fire HD 7. this one is totally one better.

"My daughter just turned 4. I purchased the first gen of this a few years ago and shortly got rid of it for my other daughter. This one is quick, has a ton of storage, and she loves it. Very user friendly and love the 2 year warranty Amazon provides. Much better than the one from a few years ago."

My son picked this out and loves it. He was so happy with his purchase

This product is amazing ! My wife loves it! I would totally recommend this to a friend!
We are a big fan of this tablet. The cost was great and if we ever do run out of space for whatever reason we can purchase more.
"Amazon Fire is easy to handle and read with 8"" display screen. Alexa voice is convenient. Downside is Amazon doesn't allow you to download Google as a search tool. Overall good tablet for the price."
This tablet is cheap but wonderful. I bought 3 on black friday just to give them to family members.
Choose this because of amount of expandable memory.Easy to use and long battery life.
"So far I have been very happy with this tablet. It is fast and user friendly. The camera is not very useful as the quality is lacking, but for me it does not make much of a difference."
Love this product.. and glad I got it as a gift...
"We bought 2 of these for our great grandsons. It a personal thing, built tough, they can learn, entertain themselves, and let great gramps sleep when they use the headphones."
"I use it mostly to watch videos, movies on it on the go. I have an iPad Pro 12.9 inch and I love it but I‚Äôm always nervous about dropping it. The kindle fire is great because it‚Äôs so durable"
We bought this for my grandson and it has worked out well for him.

This is a Christmas gift for my husband. He is very pleased with it
"My 3 year old daughter loves this, it makes her feel grown like her sisters, it is user friendly for a small tike, safe from drops and falls from the protective casing and the warranty on it from amazon is amazing for 2 year, no questions replacement even if it broken screen."
Bought this for my 2 year old daughters birthday and she loves it. Easy to use and navigate. Look up some videos on how to install Google store and the tablet is perfect. Case is reliable as I have seen my daughter drop her kindle on carpet and hardwood floors with no damage. Highly recommend
My husband loved his birthday gift. He is always on it. He uses the tablet instead of his phone.
She is already using it to help with school assignments. She is learning and having fun. Parent dashboard rocks. Love the status update on her activities and suggestions for parent-child discussions. Her teacher gave it a thumbs up also. 11 year old and 5 year old have already asked for as Christmas presents.

"HD8 tab went for $50 on black friday, its supposed to be HD, it probably is but no comparison to the samsung galaxy tabs. But for the black Friday deal, you cant beat it!"
This is the best priced device that I found with the most functionality. Amazing black Friday deal!!!
"Great toy for a 6 years old nephew, which was the reason why I buy this tablet. Had all need it for hours of entertainment for my nephew, I download a few games and load a couple of movies, the performance was great but then I found a couple of issues.First, I was unable to directly download any app from the tablet, receive a constant error saying than I need to activate ONE-CLICK DOWNLOAD, I follow all instructions and had to create a virtual credit card (I never insert my real credit card on a 6y/o toy, never), even if my intentions was only download free apps. Nothing works, change the address, change the credit card, try everything and nothing works. Finally I found a bypass method which is use my browser on my pc, connect to the amazon account and link the tablet, then I was able to install new apps.The second issue was to discover than the tablet can be only use on US, my surprise when I try to add more apps when I travel outside US and after hours of trying, found the answer on a forum when indicate than the tablet was created to be use on on US."
Bought it just because and don‚Äôt regret it one bit. Super fast and crystal clear picture.
Bought this just because it was a good deal during the holidays. Ends up I use this ALL the time! The screen size & HD is perfect for watching shows and movies when I'm on the go.
Easy to use and set up. Great bargain for a tablet with versatility.
Great buy to keep the child occupied during car rides
"My granddaughter loves it. She has,all her movies and educational games on it."
THESE TABLETS ARE PERFECT FOR TODDLERS! I WAS PLANING TO BUY MY 5 AND 3 YEARS OLD AN IPAD BUT CAME ACROSS THESE AND AFTER READING REVIEWS I DECIDED TO ORDER. THE COVERS WORK GREAT SINCE MY 3 YEAR OLD ALWAYS DROPS IT. TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!
"This kindle is the 7th one in our house. This was a purchase for my youngest son who is ASD (high functioning, but still has meltdowns when things aren‚Äôt done correctly) and this was to help us travel. Made it through with only one big meltdown. The kindle certainly helped."
This tablet is perfect! It works exactly as described in the other reviews.

"Great deal, excellent price for such built-in features!"
Great battery life. Great graphics. Great for reading.
It works well you can still have ur games. Facebook or any social media. U can still search websites
Its a sturdy and great device.Only drawback i can think of is non availability of pure android and a VGA camera.However it works really good for daily use
This id my third kindle upgrade and they keep getting better and easier to use. It is a great device to use while flying as I can either read a book or watch a movie.
"I like the closed ecosystem, your kids don't see what they shouldn't, what i didn't like my daughter made a purchase by mistake on day 2, turnoff the the one click buying. also i don't like that its set up like its the parents device with the child using it, so there are two steps to logging in. also i don't like the lack of google apps, the device itself itself has a great screen and weight, the bumper is tough and easy to clean, and overall i would recommend it for a 4yo."
Easy access to a lot of different apps . My daughter loves to watch YouTube and Netflix .

I'd been contemplating trying out an Amazon Fire for a while just to see if I'd recommend it to a friend as a reliable communications device. I was going to just spend $49 for the least expensive Amazon Fire but when I found this Fire HD on sale for $79 I grabbed it up. What a smart choice. Not only is it great for email (I'm using the Outlook client app) but texting too (I'm using the Verizon text app) it's great for watching movies and listening to music as well.
The Amazon Kindle Fire is an excellent. I got 3 of these on black friday. However I was unaware that the tablet were the offers version.
I bought the Amazon-Fire HD 8-8‚Äùtablet for my grandson so he can have a portable way of getting on line or studying after school when he is at his sitters home.

"We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface."
"We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well.

We like the durability but wish there were more applications available (Google play store). The other challenging thing is we would prefer to have more control over what the kids can do. Our standards are a bit different than whoever is in charge of choosing age appropriate apps.

"Grandkids like them, ages ranging from 2,8, and 9."
MY THREE YEAR OLD LOVES THIS THIS AND WHEN HE GOES TO BED I USE IT TO READ.LOVE THE MULTI USE OF IT
Easy to use my 2 year old loves it and I can use it for my needs also

"Easy to use. Easy to read. The SILK browser a little slow. Adequate for regular apps.Honestly, I have not maximized its potential."
"This is a great, easy to use tablet. It's nice because it doesn't have to be ""just a kids tablet."" I can do what I want to do on there as well. The parental controls are great. The case makes it feel pretty durable. The battery lasts a really long time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we can't get all of our apps/games on there because they're not available which is pretty disappointing. One real popular one we can't get is YouTube kids. My son loved that. He was pretty bummed about that. Overall we love the tablet, and would definitely recommend it."

It‚Äôs a tough tablet...perfect for kids! And I love the ‚Äúparent control‚Äù so we can limit our child on how long she can be on the tablet.
"This works awesome for kids. My son and daughter, love to play on it."
"I bought this as a gift for my four year old son, couldn‚Äôt pass up on the price. My son seems to enjoy it. Has plenty of learning apps that help with directions,colors and numbers."

"Bought this Kids Kindle at the Westland in a sealed box. Purchased this because of the 2 year warranty against anything and the 1 year access to Kindle software. It was purchased for a 2 year old. My daughter and her Marine husband were going to an Army base in Missouri the next day about a 12 hour drive. This Kindle has a SD slot so I wanted to load up a bunch of kids movies to keep him entertained on the trip, and then be able to get kids educational software later. The trip went fine and the Kindle worked great. Attached it to the headrest of the front seat with rubber bands. Unfortunately when they arrived in Mossouri and my daughter tried to register the Kindle, Amazon said it wasn't a Kids Kindle. I contacted the local Best Buy and explained the problem and they said it could be exchanged no problems. So the next week my daughter and her husband made the 75 mile drive from the Army base to Jefferson City the nearest Best Buy and made the exchange no hassles. While still in the store my daughter contacted Amazon and successfully registered the Kids Kindle. They've made several long road trips since and the access to kids movies on the SD chip have been a blessing. It's held up well to a 2 year olds handling and overall works very well. Great service from Best Buy."
"For the price this is a great purchase, but don't expect it to perform like an iPhone or high end mobile device. If you're buying this to play mobile apps it's great with minimal lag."
My daughter loves this tablet! It's got loads of apps to choose from & the graphics are great!
It's highly functional and compact. Easy to navigate and I just love it.
Loved it! Great product for my 10 year old son!!!!
"Really enjoying my new Kindle HD Fire 8"" screen! It's a step up from my old Kindle 7"" that I used for over 5 years and this one is a little larger and also very quick for the game I like to play on it. It's also useful to browse on facebook and check my email. All my books I had on my old Kindle are right here on my new one so was able to just get hooked up to my internet and get right back to what I was doing before! Very satisfied with my new Kindle!"
I grandson loves this cannot put it down.it is very easy to use
My grand son loved this tablet. Love the Amazon warranty.
My great grandson loves it he watches movies on it
My kids love it. Simple learn and had many accessories that can purchased to protect it.
Purchased for young girl and she love it. Perfect for games
My 5 year old son has had many electronic hand me downs and we got him this one for Christmas and we could not be happier. Easy to use and plenty fast to keep up with all the games and videos he enjoys so much. I am thinking about getting a second one for my wife and I to use.Great product for the money.
This tablet has great graphics and clarity. The screen is is just right for a nighttime reader.
"Enjoyed the color, construction, and ability to control viewing for our daughter."
"As a grandparent, we purchased two of these for our grandsons (of course with Mom's help). We were looking at a normal tablet (Samsung/Apple) and finally decided on the Fire HD 8. The boys just love them, mom is happy that she can put time limits on usage and from looking at the loaded applications, they are very appropriate for child learning (strategy, logic development, etc.). We would buy them again if needed."

Easy to setup. Large screen. Protective case built-in. Two year protection plan included.
This was easy to set up. If you are used to apple products this is a difficult transition.
"It doesn't compete with the iPad in terms of screen resolution or performance but for the price it does remarkably well. Battery life is outstanding compared to the 7"" fire. Very pleased with the purchase."
"My kids haven't been able to put this down since they got it. They love all of the game options on it, many which are free. I bought two of them a month ago and have had no problems. I haven't even ran out of memory yet."
Can not complain. Especially for the price. You can't beat it.
Amazon Fire tablets are great for the non-technical user. 90% of people can use them however they are locked down to the Amazon ecosystem which prevents you from easily using applications in the Android Google Play store.
Bought a couple for my kids for xmass and they love them.
"great price, but doesn't do a number of things that it should. and the advertisements every time I turn it on really suck"
"If I wasn't able to install Google Play Store I would not have picked up, but it's not too difficult to do so. I don't care about the potato spec camera because I have a decent camera on my phone. I would still prefer a higher DPI to make text clearer but even that aspect is not that bad. Usually speaker quality on such cheap products are bad but on this they are surprisingly nice. If on a hard surface the Dolby Atmos seems to do something with the sound, not sure how to describe it but if feels like a much wider soundstage. There's a YouTube video called ""$80 Tablet vs $800 Tablet Review"" that was the final straw in terms of convincing me. He dropped the tablet from a high distances onto a hard lamented floor, sometimes almost slamming it. The tablet was fine while the floor showed some damage. Perhaps there are some super demanding games that don't run well (I don't know I haven't checked), but for everything else it's does the job well enough."
It‚Äôs a great tablet. The only downside is that some apps you can‚Äôt get. I do a lot of crafting and I‚Äôm unable to download the cricut Design app.
my stepdaughter is still learning how to navigate it but she mostly spends her time on youtube on it awesome product

Easy to use and stay connected. Light weight and easy for travel.
My daughter has had this item for a week and can't put it down. Has worked flawlessly and is very durable.
this product is great for kids under 10 years to learn and grow. I like the fact that it is created with kids in mind
My daughter loves it. She uses it consistently and her brother has expressed an interest in having his own
"My grandson loves the Fire 8 Kids. It is durable, and doesn‚Äôt mind being dropped by little hands. His mind stays engaged and car rides are pleasurable once again!"

This was a gift that was given to someone. They seemed to like it
I gave this as a gift to a teenager. She uses it mostly for facebook and to play some games. It works fine for her. She had another smaller version of this fire that only lasted a year. I hope that this one will out last that one!!
Bought this tablet as a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter. It is one of the best and most used items I ever bought her. It is super easy for her to use. It's a great teaching tool and also just plain fun. She uses it in the car to pass the time as well

"Tablet was doing good until yesterday, which is 18 day from the day I bought it, my son was using it and then it went dead."
Awesome item.Easy to learn to use and great for a new user.
This is a kids proof tablet. Peace of mind to know it's not breaking easy.
Pursued as a gift for nephew. It's durable build yet lightest was exactly what I was looking for. Display is sharp and crisp/
The tablet was a wonderful gift for our Christmas party. They were very excited to have a chance to win it.
"Screen size is good, graphics great. Just got set up and still getting used to it."
"If you like to read, I'd suggest Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 8"" - Tablet - 32GB 7th"
"I had one of the original Kindle Fire tablets and it was good, but this one is so much more. Good work!"
"The Kindle 8"" is a decent tablet computer not only for reading books, but also just a nice inexpensive device to have for when you need access to the internet or want to play a couple games.While it isn't the most powerful tablet out there, you also won't feel that put out if it gets broken or swiped.I would also highly recommend the Amazon-branded case for it. Not only does it fit seamlessly, the magnets built into the case put the device to sleep when you close the cover."
Bought two for our 5-year-old twin god-children and they love it. It's both a learning tool and can also be used for entertainment. Great Investment in their future.
good value and great ease of use. Large screen and resolution
I love Fire HD this will be the 4th one I got for my kids and family members.
I love my new kindle. I was also very pleased with the Best Buy store pick up.
My two year old granddaughter loves this. Easy to set up and use. We had one problem when it suddenly stopped working. Held the power key down for 40 seconds and it's as good as new !
Purchased this for my wife and she is very happy with it. She uses it everyday and hasn't had any negative experiences.
I bought this item in a good deal and i am loving it. It does what it say.
"This is a great tablet, perfect size, and works very fast."

Good for kids. Good parental control. Great shipping.

Love this product. Great for reading and playing games.
The rubber case has been a game changer. It is a very easy product to set up restrictions for a child to use.
"The Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 8"" - Tablet - 32GB was delivered quickly, set-up was easy as we already have another Kindle Fire, and the unit is terrific for our use (web browsing, YouTube, videos). The unit is fast, screen is very clear, and battery is good."
"This kindle is slimmer than the older version. It is great for everyday use to read books, watch tv shows and movies. It is also Alexa enabled. I am very pleased with my order."
this kindle is great especially for the free time app my son loves it
The Kindle HD 8 is very good. Has good graphics and is easy to use. Gave to sister for a gift and had to help her set it up but then she was off and running using it to play games and check her email.
We got this pad for my son who's 7. He absolutely loves it. I like the parental controls so that he reads before doing other games. Will recommend to anyone!!!
"Great little tablet for reading and watching videos, nice large, clear screen while still being able to fit in a large purse."
"I was unable to connect my Ring app and my ecobee app. Furthermore I‚Äôm more invested in the Apple ecosystem than with amazon. I returned this tablet for that reason. It worked well, and and would have been great long term but this one simply came down to personal preference"
"Purchased as a Christmas present for my mom. who was already an Amazon tablet users, this one was a tad bigger and has served her well. the price for performance is exceptional. highly recommended."
"Have been using the older kindle fire 7"" for my kids and wanted something to gift. Kindle at this price is a very attractive product. The updates in the hardware are noticible when I compare them to my kids kindle. I gave 4 stars as I am mentally comparing this to a full featured device like the surface or the iPad Pro."
"Offers ability to use as a tablet, read, games and many other apps. Perfect to take on the go"
This is a great low cost alternative to the more pricey brands that basically do the same thing!
"While the kindle fire is a full-fledged tablet, I‚Äôve found with things like the blue-shade display setting, this tablet makes a good e-reader. If you already have a kindle, such as the paperwhite, you might not like this for reading, but add all that the kindle fire brings, and you easily can leave the kindle at home on trips and such."
My baby likes it and it's help her with her school work.
"No matter if you have an IPad or computer or both, this is a great device to have. Perfect for travel. Download movies and tv shows so you can watch without WiFi. Read books. Listen to music. Read emails. So many applications in an inexpensive, portable tablet. If you subscribe to Amazon prime, this is a must have."
Perfect size. Love new features. Easy to use......
"First off, I‚Äôm primaril an Apple product user that chose this unit because of its price & child centered form factor. Price - compared to an iPad was - & form factor such as weight & resilience from being dropped from reasonable heights were definite strengths. The ability to discretely control access for a 2 to 4 users was also a plus. Relative down side for me has been counter intuitive user interface as compared to Apple products."
My daughter loves her tablet and I love the parental controls. I can monitor everything and dont have any unwanted credit card charges. Can even set a curfew on it!

"Durable, fast, and reliable, this tablet is ideal for today's tween generation and some minors."
Buying the kid version of the kindle was the way to go! We are able to control everything our son watches and does. The case seems to do the job protecting it as well.

"Bought for streaming live TV, movies and sporting events"

Good for what I need. Purchased for a Christmas present
got one for each of the kids. they were able to download apps and use em for several different things
"Great tablet for kids to keep them entertained, comes with android."
I love my tablet. Great price great for a beginner. I use the tablet more than my Gift an IPad.
The 12-days of great buys that included this product was awesome!
The Fire HD 8 was a replacement for my grandsons Samsung tab 7. I was pleasantly surprised how nice this tablet is for the price. I would of gave it a 5 but it‚Äôs a little slow at times but don‚Äôt let that hold you back from purchasing this. Nice screen looks great with videos. Volume is a little weak but not bad.
This was a black Friday deal and we won on this one. I would highly recommend to anyone
Perfect balance between a small and large tablet with HD.
I love my Kindle Fire & the cover we purchased separately! We also just purchased a Dell Lap Top the other day too & I think I use the Kindle more than the lap top! Perfect size!!!
"If you want a basic reader that can be used as a mini tablet, then this is a good deal for the price"
"If you want a basic tablet this is perfect for you. However, if you are heavily invested in Android, this tablet will disappoint. Very Amazon driven, runs slowly with Android software sideloaded."
My kids love there amazon fire. It is fastand loaded with many fun apps.
Christmas gift for my grandkids.. IÔ∏è will update once she uses it..
Better cost value than IPads. Tablet is user friendly and convenient. Anyone can use this

I bought this on Black Friday...what a deal $49.99!! I did not expect to make this purchase when I walked in but I ended up buying two. One I kept for myself and am so glad I did. I love it. The other I gave as a gift.The picture is very clear and it is a perfect size that won't strain your eyes watching Netflix and surfing the web.

I wish it was more user friendly for my 2 year old.
My kid loves the tablet. She is learning so much with the apps.
My son loves it. I bought this one because it‚Äôs a kids model and has a great rubber protector. I went through 3 kindles from amazon and they all broke very easily and one would get too hot to touch. This one from Best Buy is awesome. Definitely recommend.
My son loves this thing. It takes his abuse and keeps on working.
My wife loves this product. She loves playing games on it.
This can be shared will multiple family members. You can have kids and adults use the same tablet and keep each separated.
This generation of kindle fire is excellent. The addition of alexa was key.
This is a great tablet. Does everthing and more that a tablet should do.
"This product works perfectly for my little daughter. It seems indeed durable with the cover around, battery life quite impressing."

Gift for my mom who loves her electronics and she's satisfied with this kindle. Its simple and east to use.
"I bought it at 50 bucks , a excellent price for this tablet, is not the best on the market but is the best on the price segment"
Bought this tablet for my granddaughter and I'm kind of jealous. It has a padded bezel that makes it very easy to hold. The padded bezel also guards against drops and bumps. Very well designed.
I purchased this tablet for my son as a replacement for an iPad. I was impressed with the quality and picture of the tablet. Definitely worth the price!
Great reader. Easy to hold. Easy to adjust light Lightweight.
The Kindle Fire HD was a replacement for a previous generation fire and the improvements are noticeable. Thinner profile and much nicer screen image are immediately noticeable. Video loooks great and the features on the Fire are outstanding for such a low price point. Highly recommended for a basic tablet as compared to far more expensive options.
"When I bought this it was to use for reading, but it‚Äôs also a great tablet. Download apps, surf the net and more."
"Christmas git so cant wait to see expressions, I'm sure they willbe happy!"
This is great for everyday use. Fits the bill when I need something bigger than my phone but smaller than my laptop.
It will make using tablet easier for first time users Transports well. Good value for the price
"Perfect for children or for someone that is curious about trying something that isn‚Äôt an Apple iOS. Also great for someone that has an Amazone Prine memberships. If you want the FULL Android experience though, you should get a different tablet. You get what you pay for."
Perfect tablet for little ones and the not so tech savvy.
bought it for my nephew. runs great. excellent value for the price.
Bought this during the Black Friday deal.A decent and a good tablet for the price of 50 bucks.

"For the price and brand is perfect, no complaints at all"
"For what it is, it is a great tablet. Very responsive, great graphics everything you would expect in a good tablet. My problem, I was raised on Android!

Got these for my grand kids and they love them...already went thru 6 of them...lol
"Got this tablet to replace the nabi my 4 yr old daughter had. I picked this tablet because of its 2 yr no questions asked return policy, If u have kids you know they always find away to break spill or the software glitches. So far this tablet works great it's way faster then the nabi was its easy for my 4 yr old to work and I can set time limits and what she can do it also shows me what she uses and for how long each day. The tablet is light and easy for her to hold and the bumper has worked good when it has been dropped. Has a great selection of free apps books and games for a full year after that its $4.99 a month. My 8 yr old wants one now and she currently has a ipad but says the amazon works better and she loves the selection of books. I would recommend this tablet"

I like how it works and it size very compact perfect for travel
"I love this tablet, amazon did a great job with this one, Alexa is an added plus"
I love this tablet. I had a 7 inch version fro years until it got broken so I decided to go with the HD8. Great choice.
"I love this tablet. It‚Äôs a perfect size. It‚Äôs bigger than a phone but smaller than a laptop. I really bought it for reading but I use it for everything...,games, read my emails, stream music, and search the web."
I purchased the Fire 8 for reading & playing games. So far so good. I really like it.
"I purchased this tablet because I wanted a bigger tablet. I also wanted an Amazon Fire and I got it at a great price, Right I basically use it for reading. I'm still learning the tablet. So far it's a really good tablet."
I purchased this tablet for my 83 year old mom who has never used a computer. She wants to be able to purchase items on line.
I use it for streaming movies with or without wifi
It is a little bigger than my other one but I am getting used to it. Lots of other features that my old one didn‚Äôt have. Would buy it again!

Purchased for Xmas gift for my grandson very nice tablet about to purchase one for myself
"Purchased four of these when they were on sale and ended up saving over $200. It‚Äôs a great tablet, super friendly for my kids. I think at this point they know it better than I do. Love the way you can set up different profiles and the parental controls are awesome."
Samsung has done it again. I love the kid features and so does my son. Easy to navigate and many great apps for kids.
"Simply put a great tablet for the price. To surf the web or check e-mails, it's great."
Tablet is fast and works as it should. Just wish I could download some apps off the the android site.
The tablet is easy to use for my kids .they can do homework and play games or watch movies.
This android tab is perfect for kids since its not that expensive
"This is a best bang for your buck deal, very reliable and the price was perfect, especially for beginners"
This is a great Tablet for the kid's if you don't want to spend the money for a better brand.
"This is a great tablet, I use it only for social media and is great for it, also for web surfing it has a good speed, the only bad thing is the camera"
This is a nice size for holding and viewing. I debated on getting the next size up but glad I didn't. You can also create different profiles. I set up a separate profile for my granddaughter and it allowed me to add restrictions so she can't access certain things or make purchases in apps. It also gave me a 30 day free trial for Amazon FreeTime which has so much content just for children. Happy with the price and product.
This tablet is great for children. This is my daughter's second tablet. The preset apps are very usual.
This tablet is great! My daughter loves it and will not leave home without it
This tablet is so much better than the cheap tablets on the market. Good parent controls too.
This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson and he loves it! He is able to download lots of games and the rubber case keeps this device well-protected.
"Very easy to use, great way to help all your books in one spot on the go."
Very happy with the purchase. Would recommend to anyone
very simple and easy to use for children & also parent to be able to control.
Was lookin for a kids tablet that had enough storage and speed. Love i can run play store apps and amazon apps for my daughter.
"We bought this for my son, for his second birthday. He absolutely loves it and there were already apps that he could play. Worth the money."
We bought this for our three year old son. He loves it. Plus it has many options for us to keep him from seeing things he shouldn't. The layout is really simple also making it great for children or adults!

Our family has been using Amazon tablets for about 5 years now and we have had 4 different versions of tablets and so far this is the best one we have owned.
"The Kindle Fire 8 has a lot of great features including great graphics and expandable memory slot. The battery life is acceptable and 5GHz wifi connectivity insures fast internet access. The 8"" tablet size is small enough to hold in a single adult hand and its not too big for kids to use. It also works great if you have Amazon Prime and can stream video content from your Prime subscription as well as use the Amazon shopping app. Other streaming apps work as well including Youtube and Netflix."
all and all its a great table i just wish amazon had more apps for the kids to play
The tablet is wonderful the only negative about this tablet is that it doesnt allow you to download kids youtube or any google app that im aware of.... i almost returned the tablet but i found a website that showed me how to turn off security settings and download the links i needed in order to get the app so now everything is great and we love it!
My husband and I are not experts on the new technology of phones so we decided to start out on a tablet. We choose the Amazon - Fire HD 8-8 because of a recommendation from a computer expert.
Excellent screen size and storage. Nice that it includes a case.
Never had a Tablet before. Did not know they function so great. Easy to use especially streaming movies. I loaded my HBO and ShowTime APPs. I watch movies on the go. I use it to check E mails. Surf the internet. Best part is that the Tablet is so cheap in price.
Our grandson has really enjoyed using his tablet which we gave to him at his birthday in March.
Would highly recommend to anyone with children. Great value for money

"This is a wonderful tablet with a great screen, reliable touch responsiveness and a clean UI.The only drawback is the lack of the Google Play Store and Play Services."
I bought this for my niece as a gift and she loved it! Can't go wrong with a tablet.
"Awesome little tablet for very cheap. The ads on the lock screen are kind of cheesy, but screen resolution is solid and it runs all the regular apps. My IPad is nicer and runs smoother, however costs hundreds more. For the price, this product can't be beat."
This has worked perfect for me and my little ones to play some games and email. Still exploring all abilities.
"My new tablet, is easy to use, it is also very easy to travel with."
"I love how thin it is. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 and honestly I like this one better. Its simple, has a beautiful user interface, and it multitasks well. The battery life is great. Very loud speakers to be a tablet. Its much different from an iPad or Android tablet, it took a little bit of exploring to fully figure everything out, and the settings are more limited but it works for what I need. The only con I've found so far is that the Appstore is more limited than Apple or Google Play but I haven't had a problem finding similar apps."
I bought this Amazon Fire HD Tablet for my 3 yr. old grandson for Christmas. It has been keeping him occupied with so many educational activities and games!
This tablet is good for beginners and immediate use. The picture and processor is great. Let‚Äôs not forget this is a amazon product.
Had a kindle fire for 5years and just got the new one we use it all the time

Runs smoothly and it's entertaining. Perfect size!
I love the tablet and iseasy for my grandchildren to learn on apps

Bought this for my disabled brother-in-law in a nursing home. Exactly what he can handle and meets his needs.
Both my kids play with this and love it. It‚Äôs customizable for each age. Love it!
I have never owned an Amazon tablet. It is great for what I need it for. Not loving the backspace key on keyboard- hit it often by accident when typing. overall a great price for it.

"Daughter loves it. I love the Amazon free time that came with it. Has access to lots of books, videos and apps that are appropriate for kids. Love that I can add websites and apps that I decide she can watch. Pretty durable so far. She's had two other tablets but I like this one much better. definitely would recommend."

My daugther loves this tablet and its helpful for parents

I am suprised at how well this tablet works compared to the Samsung tablet it replaced for $50 less.
Why buy a cheapo generic android tablet when you can get a Fire tab that has a massive company behind it.
Strong amount of features and very fast. Easy to use tablet that my daughter is really enjoying.
"My 4 year old has low vision, and this tablet is the perfect size for her to see everything that she is playing. She also finds it very easy to do everything on her own with out any help from me. I love it so much that I plan on getting one for my 3 year old as well."
"Delight your child with books, games and shows tailored just for him on this Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet. The 8-inch high-definition display offers immersive play or viewing, and a parental dashboard lets you set up appropriate content or time limits. This Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet comes with a durable case that resists damage."
Purchashed this tablet for my son as a Christmas gift and he loves. Amazing features and very entertaining for a child
"My granddaughter was thrilled to see her new tablet on the day of her birthday. The color and size was perfect for her little hands. She could not wait for the tablet to charge. She kept asking if the tablet was ready to turn on. When the tablet finally charged, she could not put it down. She went from room to room showing her brothers what she could do with her tablet. Everybody wanted to do something with her tablet. As a parent, I just love the rubber bumper. The rubber bumper around the tablet is an excellent bonus to the tablet. It helps protect the tablet if it drops or falls accidentally. We all know how little hands sometimes drops things more than once. I only wish we could have bought this tablet much sooner. Being a first grader this year, my granddaughter can really benefit while using this tablet. Also, there are many educational opportunities for young children to engage themselves in instead of being glued to the television on a daily basis. This tablet is more child-centered and parental controlled."

Like it alot my child likes it so lets see how long itll last her
Bought this for my dad as a present and he loves it. Simple to use right out of the box
"Had this tablet before for my daughter but charger messed up, so I had to go get another one for her. I‚Äôm sure she will be pleased."
This tablet is just right for my 8 and 5 year old granddaughters. Perfect size for them.
User friendly. Simple navigation. My 6 year old Grandson makes a lot of video‚Äôs and it was the perfect gift.
My son has enjoyed his tablet very much. He loves listening to the pandora music.
"This tablet has lots of kids' programs and is nearly indestructible. Our grandson uses it every day, as well as grandma's iphone 7."
This tablet was bought as a gift for my 3 year old Grandson. I researched the top selling tablets on line before deciding on this one. Best purchase EVER. This tablet will grow with him and even gets Mom and Dad's ok.
"I was hesitant when buying this but it has exceeded my expectations. It is fast, battery life is great, and the screen resolution is as described. I have used it to read my online books/textbooks. Perfect for a student. Opens files easily from email. Only con is it doesn't have Google Play Store but that can be resolved by downloading it yourself, just google how to do it, it's very simple!"
It was a gift but they loved it. They love to watch movies online
"As long as Wi-Fi is available, this little Beauty helps me keep working. Camera ain't much to write home about, but I didn't purchase for that feature. Easy to use, very healthy battery and long time between charging."
Bought this for my son and he likes it. He is reading more now.
Blue light filter can be set to turn on anytime before bedtime. Text is clear and easy to read. Almost any app can be downloaded that you might want. Great addition to my digital products.
"I really enjoy this tablet! I mainly use it for magazine subscriptions, books, light gaming and shopping.Works great!"
This Tablet is great and Fun to use. The screen is great on it
Tablet is easy to set up and to use. The Alexa function is a great asset. It is small enough to carry anywhere and functions with the precision one would get from a fuller size tablet. Great functional tech tool.
I got this tablet because my wife bought the same thing when she upgraded her Kindle. I was shopping all kinds of tablets. But I didn't want to spend big money just to surf my emails and watch video. This does both very well. Super fast with my wi-fi! Great tablet for the money!
We are having fun with this tablet. HD movies and games...easy to use and to read kindle books!
I purchased two of these tablets for my kids. They already had other tablets. The Amazon Fire was suppose to be a backup tablet when their battery ran low. But they use them as their primary tablets instead. They love them.
Good tablet for kids in a reasonable price. Just wanted something for my ki8ds to be able to play games and watch videos on.
"I bought this for my wife, at Christmas. She likes word games and Facebook.works fine for all she uses it for"
I grabbed this for a friend for christmas. He seems very happy with it
I've had mine for over a year now and it still works fine. Its a great alternative if you don't want to spend $400 on other tablets.
"If you are looking for this $80 tablet to compare with a $350 IPad, you will be disappointed. But for what you pay...it's an outstanding little tablet. The screen has a nice crisp picture and the sound is very good. If you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, then this purchase is a no-brained. Even if you aren't, it's a great Netflix player, web browser, and kindle reader. Great value for $80."
"Lovely tablet, works well for my use. Would definitely buy again"
"Not the best tablet, but it does the basics for an awesome price!"
"Outstanding tablet for the money, it does everything and more than I expect Long battery life and Apps are very quick to start."
The tablet is a perfect tablet and the price is perfect.
"This tablet is exactly what Best Buy was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers."
This was purchased for my 9 year old and he loves it.
"works great, easy to read, portable, great value for the money"
Got this for my grandson. He loved it. Easy to use .
I bought this tablet for a 10 year old. He has had other inexpensive tablets but not with all the features. This will be good for playing games and down loading books.
My husband was recently diagnosed with Encephalitis and needs to regain his memory. He loves doing crosswords on his tablet
"The best tablet fory toddler, who constantly drops his tablet! We love all the preinstalled apps & videos."
"The best tablet fory toddler, who constantly drops his tablet! We love all the preinstalled apps & videos."
This replaced an older kindle and it is a great product.
This is a great tablet for my 3 and 5 year old and I don't stress when they get dropped because of the protective case!
"My daughter is artistic, and we were looking for a tablet that would not only serve as a teaching tool, but also be able to put up with typical abuse of a toddler. It is only lacking the ability to download apps from the google play store, which can be worked around by downloading the apk files and installing them. The other issue is being able to move said apps from the play store to the child‚Äôs profile of the tablet. I am still working on finding a way to make this happen."

"Purchased this tablet for my kiddo, very easy to set up and he loves it!"
"I absolutely love my kindle. This is the second one that I've had, and the only reason I bought another was because my ex broke the first one. Its a great tablet to read on, but i also use it to watch Netflix, go on social media, and play games. It's the size of a book so it's never uncomfortable to hold and the battery life lasts forever."
I bought this tablet to replace another one I had that ran to slow and had barely any storage space and so far so good! I've been using it for a few hours everyday for about a week and haven't had to recharge yet! The tablet runs quickly opening browsers and apps. It has more storage than my other tablet and has an SD card port. Even though it's an 8in screen it does it feel like it because the pictures are so vivid. So far the only thing I don't like is that you can't mirror or cast it to a TV or computer screen. Other than that it seems to work great.
Purchased this for my wife because of the size. She loves it!
The tablet has great picture and apps but the sound is really bad and this is 3rd tablet
"Awesome product, great battery life! I will say this is the best tablet for this awesome price!"
For a cheap tablet I was surprised how good the amazon Fire handles. Very good hardware and software for cheap!
"Got this for my nephew, he loves it. Downloaded a ton of content and still super quick. However the cameras are AWFUL!!!!"
This is my 3rd tablet the screen seems bigger in this one and I love it! I use it for all of my media internet searches and needs
kindle fire 8 has everything you could want in a tablet.
My 1 1/2 yr old uses this tablet easy to use and setup. I love that you put in her age and it only pulls up age appropriate. Battery last long and heavy duty.

Awesome tablet. Was a better choice to start my kids off with this one. Better ta let with the same benefits as the kids model.
Great tablet for the money. Nice screen size allows me to watch movies on it.
worth every penny. Its fast and loaded with lots of apps.
This tablet has everything. It‚Äôs very easy to navigate. It‚Äôs especially great for beginners and people who are not quite computer savvy.
"My old kindle fire needed replacingLove my new one, great features, lightening fast, New size is easy on the eyes"
Great size easy to hold overall it a great tablet.
This toy is a look into the future on fuel energy.
"When you get this device please update the software (you might have to run update a few times - I did it 4 times) and then it will start to work properly. Also, if you are not an Amazon table user, then some of this is slightly different to use. Great for the kid to use and the apps in freeplay seem to be great for my kid of 7"
My Goddaughter love playing games on my tablet and watching her shows. Not we can load her favorite books and shows on her on tablet.
Great product I got it to stream you tube from device to my tv
"Wonderful newest generation. Faster and lighter than the last one. Also nice upgrade to the home screen programming. Make's it much easier to see and find what you have looked at. It is used for everything from reading, internet, shopping, email and even spreadsheets. Also, the price is a no brainer. Great little tablet."
"I upgraded from Fire HD 8.9 this tablet is fast, and I love how it has for memory card my other one lacked that. My tablet came charged at 75% I have the fast charger since that is what I use with my other tablet. I have to say it took 1hr to fully charge. I am not sure why that other reviewer complained that it took a day to charge and that is wrong. Maybe he should invest in the fast charger?The sound is pretty good without headphones. I love that is not too big or small good enough to take anywhere. For the price and for what you are getting this a great tablet for anyone."
"For the price Amazon is offering these tablets they're great! Honestly, if you're looking for something to watch Netflix, YouTube, basic apps as well as play a few games these tablets are amazing. I love the fact that their great quality for the price. Obviously they're not the best tablets in the entire world, but for what you pay, their fantastic."
Good tablet with easy functionality. Size makes it easily portable.
Great product for the price. It is not a high end tablet but great for browsing and reading
Received order quickly and compete. I recommend purchasing grin best buy.
"This tablet is a rock star. I do everything on it. Bright display, sound, And an unbeatable price. Of course, the price point is due to the baked in advertisements that you get every time the device wakes up - a little annoying, but manageable. Again, that price really makes it for me and it really is quite capable."
"I mean, you can't argue with the price of this, but it's lacking some big name apps that I thought would have Amazon Fire versions but don't. Like Dropbox or BBC News or LA Times. Screen is great. Battery seems to last a long time. And the size is better than iPad if you're using it for reading mostly, you can hold it in one hand. I'd recommend... but with caution that you're going to be missing some useful apps."
"I purchased this tablet during the black Friday deals and for the price it is a pretty decent tablet. There is no lag when browsing multiple pages and even watching videos. 4 stars given as I haven't fully explored all features, but so far so good!"
"My primary tablet is the iPad Pro but I couldn't resist picking up the Amazon Fire tablet at Best Buy during their Amazon promotion day when the price dropped by $30. I really like the smaller size compared to my iPad Pro. By default, the display brightness was set to adjust automatically but I found this to make the screen too dark, especially for watching videos on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Fortunately, that is easily adjustable in the display settings. I know this drains the battery quicker but the battery still lasts several days with limited use. I paired a bluetooth keyboard to it just to try and it worked fine. The ads that appear when unlocking the screen really don't seem to be a bother. Given the price of this tablet I really have no complaints."
User friendly. Lightweight. Easy for the kids to use. Fast start up. 4 year old operates it easily. Didn't get 5 stars because it was broken in less than a month. Buy the warranty if it's for a child.
"I am happy with the Fire given the price I paid. As reviews stated, the camera is not very good. Would like it better if it could mirror to a smart TV. Otherwise, for the value it is a good product."
"I bought it to run a lot of home automation things. But after 5 apps wouldnt run like I expected them to, it was of little use to me."
Teaches with a well known strategy and keeps them entertained.
"Great value, perfect for what my needs are. Would highly recommend this product. This is the second one I've bought."
I bought this Kindle just to have a dedicated e reading device. The price was extremely reasonable.
"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he will not put it down. He has checked on all of his accounts, downloaded his VUDU movies and other movies from other apps that he previously purchased, played games, and everything else you can do with a tablet. He also uses it for reading, too."
This product was a great purchase. i highly recommend it!
I got it for my kids age 4 and 8 it came with 1 year of free subscription. When I set kids profiles each got apps best selected for their age. So my 8y.o. won't play 'baby games'. Sometimes they like to change to watch cartoons that not available on their tablet. Time limit is very helpful. I set the tablet to lock after 1.5 hour of use and at 9 pm whatever comes first. I wish there were more apps in different languages to download.
Love these tablets so much. This is the third one I purchased for someone else in the family
IT is a great gift for kids for $90+. Kids love it and we have parental controls to set the playtime or screen time so that we can limit the usage with our parental controls.
Huh what do I get to say I got it to you have you done that I ghj
This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying.

This was a birthday gift! It has nice visual features! It was easy to get started on it! So far so good!!
"I got this so I could watch Game of Thrones in bed. Does everything I want it to. Speaker is great, clarity and sound perfect. Takes great pictures. Plus, I can play any of my favorite books. Very happy with my purchase"
"We bought this as a gift for our son's birthday - he couldn't be happier with color, and we couldn't be happier with the price. We now own 3 Kindles, and have been happy with every one!"
"I bought this Amazon Fire HD 8 purely for personal travel use because I dont like to bring my laptop in case if I lose my laptop! This Amazon Fire is cheap enough that if I lose it during personal travel, I don't care & I will just buy another one. This is my first Amazon Fire. So far, I am happy because the screen is big enough during internet surfing that I can see a whole lot better than my 4"" cell phone. If I could ""re-do"" my purchase, I should have purchased the Amazon Fire 7. Both Fire 7 & HD 8 fit in my side pants' pocket, but HD 8 is a bit bigger & thus heavier. When I looked at both Fire 7 & HD 8 in the Best Buy store, they were not connected to wi-fi. So I purchased HD 8. And, I will keep HD 8. I dont think it would be right for me to return it to BB to exchange for 7 because I already opened the package. Overall, I am happy with Fire HD 8."
Why do I get so many POP Up Adds on this! Its a great product but it's always trying to sell me something!
"I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before."
Love the beautiful color of this tablet. Features are also great for a tablet like this.
Good tablet for browsing or playing easy games. Hope movies work well but haven't tried.
"I can only compare my Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) to my two Fire HD 7 8 GB 2012 (2nd Gen) units.Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) - Pros- Wider screen - better for viewing movies.- Multiple small icons on home screen.- Around 50% more RAM- Can add microSD up to 256 GB (no need to buy 32 GB)- Good value w/ $20 discount: $59 is lot less than the Fire HD 2012.- Offers Alexa, but I haven't figured it out (I have a Fire Stick on HDTV).Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) - Cons- Same 1208 x 800, 720p HD resolution.- Only 1.3 GHz (2012 was 1.2 GHz)- Crummy front/rear cameras, no auto-focus; 2012 rear only, w/ auto-focus.- Retains panels of previously used screens: annoying to delete.- Can only send Prime videos to HDTV via Fire Stick.- No micro-HDMI port to send any content to HDTV- Held horizontal, all controls and wires are awkwardly located on one side.- Blue Shade (read at night) seems useless.- Amazon brand case is too expensive and does not stand well in portrait view.- Reviews for third party cases: sometimes expensive, almost always shoddy, usually fail at portrait viewWhere is the Amazon brand case with a fitted snap-on hard back and a fold over cover that offers true protection? I have them for my Paperwhite 2nd Gen and Fire HD 2012 - they are excellent. On/off and volume control buttons failed on one Fire HD 2012. The other 2012 works perfectly after six years. Paperwhite is fantastic.Note: Fire HD 10 32 GB with 1920 x 1200 and 1080 resolution offers much better viewing, but $150 is way too much. A current $80 discount for iPad 2017 makes Apple's entry model $249. I may try it.Bottom line: If it comes back to $59, the Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) is a worthwhile purchase."
"I've owned a couple iPads, three Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and I can without question say that this Fire 8HD is my favorite out of all. The 16Gig version is all you need. Why? Becuase the micro-sd card expands to 256 gig and the programs can be installed to the external drive...saving the valuable internal for the operating system. Samsung should do the same...if they did, I'd probably wouldn't have bought the Fire, but I'm so glad I did!! Love, love, love it!!"
The ads that pop up constantly make us almost unusable for kids.
"Small, powerful, and does well. I love this thing. It has all the apps I‚Äôd want a tablet to have and performs very well. My only complaint would be battery life being a bit on the poor side - but that‚Äôs my complaint with most of my electronics."
The extra ram makes all the difference regarding speed and responsiveness
"I bought 2 and we have enjoyed our tablets extremely. We use them all the time to watch shows on our Prime Account or Documentaries that are free, there are also free shows to watch as well and you can read books."
I bought for my 11 year old grandson to play games on.
It's the best think I ever bought for my so & grandkids
There are so many different options other than just reading that I can use.
The 8 inch size is great! I live that it has a very reasonable price.
"This is my third Kindle Fire tablet. The features, the apps, the ease of use, the display, and the fact that these tablets can do more than you might think is what keeps me coming back."
I use it for games only for when I am traveling. It is a little slow but does what I bought it for
Great for my kids. They love it. And download games and music all the time
"If you own an Alexa Device, This is a must have. It makes using an Amazon Device so easy. The OS is Android. It is not the most user friendly device for getting out apps but you will figure it out sooner or later. I deducted a star for that. For the price, It is a good device. Thanks!"
The kids love them! They give their mom a break when she needs one!
"My 2 year old broke her email pro easily Being a toddler I wasn't surprised but email makes you buy a brand new one so I bought this instead. Nowe originally she had the 7 generation one and it was only 16 G and it ran out of battery in like 4.5 hours. The 8 generation 32 G allows ny 2 year old to download plenty but with parental controls I customized myself and for a long day at the RMV or doctor office or a drive 3vstates away, even if she takes a break I don't have to recharge it for more like 9 hours. This is with downloading and watching movies and full episodes if all her favorite b shows. Also she's crazy abusive with it and it functions perfectly. My 4 year old ha's it too and his preschool teachers are begging me to tell them how he's so quick to learn almost everything they put in front of him and his vocabulary has significantly improved as well. I'm so happy with it I'm going to buy one for myself as well as a back up incase one is stolen. Only issue is the kids get addicted so it's real important to b set the timer to shut the system down so they remember to take potty breaks and play outside, but other than that I am thrilled with this product"
"I thought this would be a great gift for a child until I got to the set up. The set up could not be completed unless a credit card number was entered. I refuse to put that type of information in the hands of a child so, I returned it."
I bought 2 for my grandchildren so they can do their schoolwork on it..after xmas I will make an appointment with geek squad to have you show them how to use it...as I don't know how to...
"This is actually the 3rd one that I have bought. My Grandkids love them, and I love the warrantee that you can purchase with them."
This is cheap and best and working very good for the price
"It's still a Kindle. It's main purpose is to be a device that pushes Amazon content on you. It's not a replacement for an iPad or any other ""real"" tablet. That said, Amazon has finally created a well designed, lightweight device that is snappy and feels great in your hands. The cover is also well done. This is the Kindle that should've been 6 years ago. Oh well."
My grandson loved this product.it was very easy to use.
"It‚Äôs great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card, but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly"
I bought the cover for the tablet as well and I'm very happy with the product.
"When my lady friend looked at this model in the store and almost panted for one, I made up my mind to get her one for Christmas."
Mario gave me and excellent customer service. Nice guy.
"It has a good display and the sound is pretty impressive, I'm glad I got one,couldn't pass up the price"
Bought for our son. It's not built as well as the Ipad but it has the things he is interested in.
"Get this for shopping and fun, not for productivity. This is an inexpensive tablet chocked full of bloatware and ads. I got it for the wife and she uses it to play mini games and shop, and that's what it's meant for so mission accomplished.The GOOD: It's cheap. Fairly good battery life. Fairly decent screen. Quick charge time.The BAD: It always has some sort of advertising for amazon shopping - annoying at times. Sound quality is terrible. Made of super slippy material, hard to hold; get a case for this or you will drop it; often. Amazon only apps. No android or IOS apps will work with this. It's kinda slow. No YouTube.Overall: If you need a simple tablet for light web browsing, shopping, music, movies, reading and small games then this will work fine. As a primary productivity tablet, forget it. Get something way more robust than this."
my 6 year old has not put this down!! It is easy to use and she loves the games that are already preinstalled!

"Our favorite item for the kids screen time! We have a few others, same brand and different, and this one is our favorite one!"
Have owned IOS products as long as I can remember. Not on same level
This edition of the kindle fire is a great improvement over the last model I had. The battery life is much better and it charges faster. The only drawback I have experienced is that the operation is sometimes slow. But I attribute that to having a 200GB expansion chip.
It‚Äôs best product for kids reading and watching videos on amazon
I wanted something for reading and surfing the web and i love it.
I wanted something for reading and surfing the web and i love it.
kind of difficult for me to figure out how to use compared to an apple
the table is very good and work like i thought it would and all i got it for my newphew he going to love it so glad i got it for him so he can do everything on it
"This was a replacement Kindle for my husband, who used his first one to death. He loves it."
"Nice crisp display, good weight and size, battery lasts a fair amount of time"
"Disappointed with screen brightness. I would not recommend it. And, yes, I adjusted the screen to maximum."
The tablet is the perfect size to fit into my purse for taking everywhere.
Good deal on this. Needed a cheap yet reliable tablet and it was a great choice
It‚Äôs the perfect size and weight. I have had iPads in the past but decided to try this and will not go back to iPads. It does all I need.
I was looking for a Bluetooth tablet for the car. My kids play DJ with the Kindle 8 HD. I purchased 64 GB of additional storage and filled it with music! Love this and it works great!
Great purchase highly recommended. Would definitely buy again.
Great purchase highly recommended. Would definitely buy again.
Updating 3 tablets for my kids from fire 7. Kids love them. Can keep them from fighting in a few seconds
Great tablet it has lots of games and books and educational stuff for kids. Parents can also use as regular tablet which is a plus.
"What more can I say besides the fact that this tablet is excellent for children? With it's child proof casing, child features, and 2 year warranty INCLUDED, it's a STEAL for any parent not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on an iPad that may break shortly into its usage!"
I bought this tablet to use with my 3 year old autistic son. I tried 3 different tablets and all 3 were defective. It would turn off by itself during a video. We were using It for his therapy sessions and this was very inconvient. Switched to a 7 and have had no trouble since.

Very easy to use and understand for my 4 year old.
"Good product for what we needed it for. It keeps my little man busy when we're in the vehicle. Bad thing is, you'll have to pre-download items for them to play on the go, or just add your own movies for the long rides."
This tablet is perfect for my grandkids. It is just the right size and comes with the protective case which is a MUST!
I love it! Recently drove to Texas and this device was a life saver. It kept my daughters entertained the times they were awake. Definitely recommend and its great for Adults too!

"Very user friendly, love the bumper guards, love all the memory compared to the 8 gb"
I bought two for my grand kids. Their parents love them ands so do the kids. Durable and great for steaming video.
Easy to use no Complains at all. Bought the case also and now the kids use it all the time.
"Bought this for my young son, because of the warranty. You are required to have a credit card stored in the account, and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like Alexa. This is the most ridiculous setup ever."
Nice product! Would Recommend! Kids love it a lot!!
"Perfect for our grandson, mom loves the parental controls and I love the no questions asked replacement policy!"
"I absolutely love the kindle fire, its is more affordable than spending hundreds of dollars on an apple product"
Replaced my mother kindle that was on the fritz. She was extremely happy to receive it.
"Good tablet for Amazon lovers, not so good for Android lovers.Too much Amazon advertising ad nauseum.. Can't get Google Play apps. Miss google. Returned to store.thanks"
My wife loves her kindle fire. It has gotten major use since purchase.
I love the Kindle Fire! So far it has great speed and is very user friendly.
Good for beginners. Although you need to have a google account and a credit card to start up. For reading purposes only.
"Compared to other tablets, the Amazon Kindle Fire is much more affordable, and just as useful as other tablets. THis is a great item and we love it"
"I love my new Fire HD 8, it's great. I have a 7 inch that I got last year, I just wanted a bigger screen and the new one also has more storage!"
Great price for a great product. I‚Äôve never heard any complaints about the kindle brand nor do I have any. Very happy with my purchase.
"Purchased this for my 18 month old granddaughter, had to return the first one due to it crashing. The second one has done the same , but plan on giving it a few more days before returning it. A little disappointed with it, expected it to be better than what it is."
"I love the Amazon Kindle Fire. I've had one for a couple years, so we bought one for our granddaughter. Can't wait to see her dive in."
I recently purchased the Kindle Fire 8 to replace a lost Kindle HD. The Fire 8 is an excellent upgrade and much better than the HD. The Fire 8 was recommended by one of the Best Buy staff that was very knowledgeable on the product. I highly recommend the Fire 8 and Best Buy
We bought a pink kindle kore for my daughter and we love it. Its the beat one we have found

"What a pleasure. This unit is lighter, faster and has more capability than my old Kindle Fire. I can use it with Spotify to play music, watch Amazon or Netflix movies, use numerous apps and read the numerous books in my library. I especially like it for web surfing. Though I still read lots of books on it."
"I had been using a 7 inch fire and purchased the 8 inch to replace it. It is the right weight and size for my reading style. Has all the bells and whistles on my iPad, but easier for reading in my opinion."
This is a replacement kindle my old one was a second generation this is a 7th generation really like it
"Bought as a gift, has larger screen size and memory for the same price."
"Very comfortable and easy to use. Has plenty of storage for my usage. I mainly use it for books, internet and old school games( solitair, sodium and crossword puzzles."
"Had to order on line, since I wanted a yellow Fire. Works well and way expected. Only comment is the battery seems to go faster than expected."
Well it is not for me but it looks very nice for young kids...
I couldn't wait to get another kindle. I had one and lost it.
I got this Kindle for my 5 year old to play games. She really like it.
"I purchased this for my daughter, so that she can read on the go. She loves it."
"We have had this device for.over a week now and we love it! We have been able to use apps that encourage my daughter with special needs development, watch movies on it and read books we don't already own through it! Both of my daughters love it... Maybe too much. I will say the interface is a little confusing to switch between the parent and the child profiles. This is not very intuitive as you have to go into the free time app to do so, but otherwise it's fairly easy to use once you understand it."
bought this on Amazon special deal day. love size of it and storage capacity and quickness of download and all apps can get
I bought these for my kids they really love them I love the fact that I can change parental settings in their learning time and the kids really enjoy them

My daughter loves this tablet. Runs fantastic! I recommend!
The battery life is great. I used it off and on for 4-5 days and only charged it once!
This kindle is neat. I love how I can save my lesson plan documents for work on the kindle. Of course I enjoy Netflix and amazon films. Not to mention making amazon purchases. This product is great!
Wanted to have multiple books available for when I travel and this works great.
"Let me say that this is my first Fire tablet. I've previously had either iPad's or Android tablets. I was skeptical at first because I've generally only liked iPad's, but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did."
Great - easy to use. Nice and clear screen. Would recommend
I do everything on my Kindle Fire. I recommend downloading the app to allow it to use Google play.
My son loves it. Easy to use. Be sure to add a password so your kids can‚Äôt buy anything without permission.
I can not put it down. I am reading all the time with kindle unlimited. Or multi tasking with all the options. There is not much that you can not do with this.
replaced am earlier version of kindle. not disappointed at all.
"Easy to carry to my Bible classes sincemy class notes, books and study materials are on it."
"If you love to read, play apps, watch movies then this is for u."
So versatile - I can use it for more than just reading
Love my tablet love how I able to get to my Amazon account. How easy it is to handle
"I am so glad I bought this for myself for Christmas. I am disabled and this is so nice and portable for me. I ended up in the hospital in March and I took it with me. Also when our tv went out, we were told it would be 4 days till a serviceman could come out. I got hulu and was watching my programs on the tablet. I am 63 yrs old and I could with the help of my granddaughter use it. It was a piece of cake."
"Great product for my kids, hours of entertainment!"
Third kindle. First was just a reader. Second was fire 7 HDX. Great screen and graphics. Love the rear facing camera. I still use all 3.
"I got it for Xmas , I needed another to just pay bills on"
"This tablet is easy for my 9 y/o to use. I like that I can set goals, time limits on games, and a curfew."
I love the size of the tablet and the HD display. The audio books is a bonus.
I bought this for my mom since my kids and I love ours
My whole family has a Kindle and loves them. Upgraded my wife to the 8 inch because she is constantly on it.
Kindle Fire is a great product. This is my Wife‚Äôs 3rd one
"This is my third kindle. The longer battery life is a big plus for someone who loves to exercise the brain working Sudoku puzzles and playing Candy Crush. The ""8"" is a little more awkward to hold in my hand than the "" 7"" but not a major problem."
"it was very easy to get started & move forward, downloading apps is easy"
"I bought my first Kindle five years ago, and decided to get a new one recently. I love the upgrade!"
pretty fast and reliable the video quality is great
"Nice size, easy to use, Blue Shade a great feature"
Best one I've owned so far. This is my 3rd Kindle. They only get better and better. The screen is awesome so clear HD quality audio is wonderful easy to set up step by step instruction
I love being able to check my email or the weather. I haven't read a book on it yet but I can. Love it.
Who needs a more expensive tablet when this Kindle Fire can do just about everything more expensive tablets can do? Love it! Use it every day!
This was a gift and so far myMom loves it. She plays on it all the time.
I have an LG tablet from Verizon that I rarely use. I find the Kindle to be much more user friendly. It does everything a tablet can do and is easier to read books on
I would recommend this product and great experience at store
Got this as a gift for 5 year old grandson. Easy to play games on with great selection of games.
I really love this tablet it is a pretty good size and it has a good amount of internal memory and has been able to do everything I have wanted it to do this far
"My 20 year old daughter loves this tablet, from reading to internet surfing to watching movies. Worth every penny"
Runs all Applications well. Especially love the Spectrum Ap so I can watch live sports.
The color is great. The price is even better the battery life is good. No complaints
The tablet works great for my family!! Has everything we needed plus more.
This tablet is great. My 2 yr old loves the puzzles and games. He plays them with or without sound which was nice during church last week. I dont let him play for too long but it sure does come in handy when I need him to be entertained. Its Also durable so I dont worry about it breaking. My son has dropped it a few times and stood on it and its fine!
Love this tablet alot. It's a good price. Easy to use and navigate.
"Great little tablet, I upgraded my grandsons other tablet to this one, it was a good decision. Again the camera is not very good, but other than that it's actually really very nice! I would recommend this to a friend or relative."
amazing tablet for kids and also adults can switch out between kid accounts and also adult account
The tablet was really easy to set up and is fast and does not stall as other tablets I have used. I have had one before and they are long lasting and very durable.
This is my first ever kindle and I'm just lovin' everything about it! The fact that I can do a lot of things with it is just great!
The is an entry level tablet for those who are looking for a budget tablet. I believe you can only access to Amazon App Store - which has fewer apps as compared to Apple Store and Google Play.
I reccomend this tabley yo every one. I purchased it for my brorher and he live it.
Purchased for a 3 and 4 yr old grandchild for preschool. Software included will take them many years ahead. Both children just took off with scheduled programs. Very solid instrument easy parental control setup. Best life investment ever. Very happy and so are the kids.
"I bought this for myself just to check my emails and messages on a larger screen than my phone. Now I find I can do so much more with it. Listen to music, pay my bills. Just as good as an iPad at a fraction of the cost."
"I love my Fire HD. It was a gift from my son for Christmas and I am able to load all sorts of apps, books and music on it. Having fun using it instead of my laptop."
This is an upgrade for my mom and she loves hers. She uses it everyday and it has been great. Looking forward to the bigger screen for her.
I got this for my mom for christmas. It is a cheap alternative to using a small phone screen
I had an old Kindle and loved it. When it quit I bought this one. It 's more like a tablet than a reader and the battery life is not great.
"Got it for my mother-in-law. After we set it up, it wad easy for her to work. Would definitely recommend."
I bought a cheaper alternative and had to return it three days later. This product is 100 %better.
"WIFE LOVES IT ,WAS EASEY TO CONVERT FILES FROM OLD KINDLE FIRE"
Many great improvents over my previous kindle from 4 years ago. It's easy to use and really affordable.
"For reading books, downloading apps and having something convenient to travel with, very good bang for your buck!"
Brought this for my granddaughter who is a bit rough with her toys. She dropped it and it bounced off the floor. No damage. Touch screen makes it easier for her to control. She's 4 and learned quick how to use it. I would definitely recommend this. After buying 3 tablets that broke within months. I finally got it right.
this is a great tablet for kids. lots of learning games and some of his favorite cartoons. very easy to use. my son has dropped it already. the case is very protective when it comes to drops.
Excellent entertainment for children. Very controlled content.

Wonderful gift for little ones my 4 year old loves the games
My daughter wanted this tablet. She couldn‚Äôt wait to get home to start using it. She spent hours quietly exploring. The comfort of knowing she can‚Äôt accidently get on sites not appropariate is the best. We don‚Äôt feel like we have to patrol what she is looking at now.

Great product for kids. My 8 year old loves the camera and ability to rock it out listening to music and watching American Girl doll shows.
"This is a great tablet and easily taken wherever you go to watch movies, listen to music and even read your books."
"I didn't buy just one, had to get a few for my family. They loved it. I want one for myself."
i absolutelt love my fire. it is so easy to ise and i love that Alexa is part of it. it is the best tablet i ever had.
"I believe I have had every generation of kindle. But, what can I say? I missed triple town. The best game out Here!"
"It was a perfect gift for my daughter. She use it for playing games, reading and taking pictures. I am planning to buy another."
I got my 10 year old grandson an iPad but did not want to give my four year old grandson such an expensive tablet yet. This was a great alternative. Very happy. Good price.
My grand baby loves it ! Made only for kids so it's perfect.
A nice tablet geared for kids. Price is lower than the one I bought last year.
I think it‚Äôs a great resource for toddlers and enhances their learning experience
I bought this for my grandson for his 1st birthday. I was unsure if he would be able to play on it but he does with ease. And it has withstood multiple drops and stool working great!
We download shows from Netflix and with the child safety programs and apps we are good with or without WiFi.
"My kid loves his new tablet , this not only teaches him new things but also entertains him for hours."
Would have gave it a 5 star but it lost my parental setup and had to reset it one time. Other than that it has been great.

Purchased this for my kiddo and he loves it! All the apps he needs are there!
Got for my mom . Ordered online From Best Buy. Came in quick.My mom learned to used this kindleEasy.
Not to bad for a new kid to the tablet world. The screen is at times difficult to swipe with some games . But my Nephew seems to like it.
My son loved it a lot. Educational apps and videos help a lot.
My son loved it a lot. Educational apps and videos help a lot.
Only down side is I have to hard reset it every so often
Purchased for my son for fun use as well as school. Works great!
Pretty sure he is probably playing angry birds with it now.
Pretty sure he is probably playing angry birds with it now.
"With pre-installed apps, a comfortable and protective case, and a year of Amazon Freetime, this product is worth every penny. The amount of educational programs available for free in Freetime is absolutely staggering. My son suddenly knew things I hadn't taught him, and when I asked him where he learned it, he would open the app and show me. He's three. It boggles the mind."
This is my third Kindle Fire upgrade and it doesn't disappoint. It is perfect for travel and I would definitely recommend.
I bought this for my wife because her old one broke and she absolutely loves it
I recently bought two new amazon tablets for an 8 and 10 year old and they're thrilled with them!
I bought this tablet for my 80 year old mom. LOVE!
"Although a new tablet, had some issues. The updates kept it from the freetime. I called tech support and did not solve the issue. I eventually figured out how to resolve the issue, a bug in the tablet os I guess. I now have a great tablet for my 3 year old."
A cheap tablet that will do all of your basic needs. It‚Äôs actually more durable then my other more expensive tables.
"It‚Äôs super big, buys it‚Äôs really clear, sound is good"
Nice upgrade from the original fire. Crisp resolution and easy to use.
Was a great upgrade from my kindle fire. Much clearer and still lightweight
We gifted this to our friend. They said they are enjoying this product.
Its a good one but didn't set for my 6 year old.So had to return it back !
It's so nice my kids happy they play game with it and watch YouTube kids
My first time purchase of a amazon tablet. Easy to set-up and operate resolution is verygood.
The HD tablet is just right for a child who is being introduced to the computer word.
Just a perfect tablet for a little girl that loves her movies
"Better than the 7 inch..by an inch, Nice little cheap tablet to use and abuse and not think twice about it."
Runs out of space fast but is good if you don't need to have a lot of storage.
"Nice basic tablet for the price. Screen colors are muted and text was not that sharp. But, for the price, it does what I need it to do (surf the web, listen to music, read ebooks, watch movies)."
"I was little skeptical to order this tablet but after a few days of using it I really started to like it. It is budget tablet for anyone looking to do the basic web activities, games and music. It does not have top end features but with expandable memory you can store a ton of music and videos."
Tablet very responsive. Alexa added to system adds to value
My second amazon fire 8 collection and I love it. Always wait for black Friday on this deals.
Good device with large screen and easy to operate for kids.
Really good Black Friday price/deal on an E-Reader
I bought this product for my wife and she loves it
"this is not the fastest nor does it have the best display. but then again its a fraction of the expensive tablets. bought this for my folks, they don't need the best as they only use these to watch youtube or use facebook, basic stuff.and the build is very nice too"
I would recommend this tablet.Thank you Best Buy for fast delivery and free ship.
Nice unit for the price. Does pretty much what a computer will do without the bulkiness
"I had also bought the amazon fire 10"" pad at the same time, I use the smaller one because it fits in the hand better. after using it for a while I purchase 3 more 8"" pads for gifts. the 10"" pad has a better screen display and sound (another good unit for the price)"
Got this for my 80 year old mother. She loves it. She reads books and plays games for now.
"I like this for the size, price, expandable memory. I dont like that Im not able to get the same apps on my android phone on this but its cool for what I use it for."
Is an awesome tablet with plenty of features that made for a perfect gift.
"I bought this as a gift for a family member. I had bought three of the same last thanksgiving as gifts as well. It's a great tablet that pretty much serves most tablet needs. But, unlike a lot of Android tablets, it gets updated by amazon and is pretty secure."
"I bought it for my daughter she loves it ,resonable price"
"Was lookin get for a tablet to use as an inexpensive second. This one has worked well for me and my needs. Use it when out at the coffee shop and take it in stores when needing to look up information on items. For the price, works very well."
Using as an e-reader pretty much. Got a fantastic sale price at Christmas. Enjoying the purchase!
"I bought an 8"" Kindle Fire because I started reading more ebooks and my iPad was a little heavy, especially for reading in bed or carrying with me all the time. I wanted something lighter that would give me all the features of my iPad. I chose the Kindle Fire because of the cost, size, features and availability of ebooks. It's working out great. I didn't have any trouble transitioning since I have an Android phone."
"Does everything I need it to, connects easily to the internet. Great size to carry along."
Good tablet for kids. This has a great interface as well.
It's cheap compare to other tablets in the market but so far runnig great.
Amazing tablet for mi 4 year old son she is happy!
Bought as a gift. This is the 4th fire tablet ive purchased. Very well made product. Battery life is good. Does averything a tablet is supposed to do..
Good inexpensive tablet for my daughter. I picked up on Black Friday for 50 bucks. She loves it.
Great tablet for my Grandson. He loves to play games and you tube
"Great tablet for the price. This may not be the fastest tablet, but it has handled any app I've put on it. The only downside is the Amazon add wake up page."
"I bought several of these for my grandkids after watching a video showing the tablet being tossed around and thrown forcibly onto the floor. During this video, the tablet was being abused but kept working without a problem. I hope my grandkids treat their tablets better than the guy in the video treated his but I believe the tablets are durable. The video guy wouldn't even consider throwing his more expensive other brand of tablet because he said he already knew it would break. I also ordered covers made of leather that will turn the tablets on when opened and off (sleep mode) when closed. I like the Alexa app and believe my grandkids will also. The tablet screen is large enough but not too large to handle. The processor is decent and although the operating version is a modified version of Android tailored for Amazon, it works fine. It is easy to use Kindle on this tablet and easy to find free or inexpensive books my grandkids will enjoy. The tablet price was great as well so I was able to give a nice gift to all six grandkids without breaking the bank! I hope the tablets I bought are as durable as the one demonstrated in the video."
"I replaced an old Galaxy Tab 3 with the Fire. It is taking getting used to, but I am excited to see how it works with all the Amazon Brand."
I was having issues with my tablet and wanted to find something less expensive that could give me netflix and my kindle books. This has both and I couldn't pass up the sale price. I like the screen size and so far no issues have come up.
My son love it. He always play using this and no problem at all.
"Really nice tablet , screen is pretty clear. Useful apps is reason I bought it."
Very nice tablet that I use mostly for playing on apps and searching the internet.
"Very nice tablet. Nice size, easy to setup. Very pleased with purchase."
Wish it didn't have all of the apps on the home page
"Great tablet for kids that comes with usage restrictions unlike Ipad. This is the reason i purchased Kindle Fire HD, I am able to limit their tablet usage compare to ipad. It comes with free (1month) Freetime app online books for my kids to read."
This is our second Kindle Fire for kids (we upgraded to the newest version). The screen is a little bit bigger and has the awesome blue light filter built into the screen so I don‚Äôt have to worry as much about my 5 year old‚Äôs eyes and macular degeneration. It has all of the features of the original kids kindle; you can set time limits and reading goals to get more game time. It is durable and our 10 and 11 year old also love theirs as you can customize it to each child‚Äôs specific age group.
"Love this inexpensive little tablet. It's not the flashiest tablet available, but it works every time and operates well inside the Amazon Ecosystem."
"I have the Samsung tab 10.1and wanted a tablet for outside to read and play games.I didn't want to ruin my good tablet so I bought the fire hd 8 and I have to say I just love it.. it's fast, screen is great and affordable and light to hold.. just buy it and try for youself..."
"An excellent tablet for the price. Just remember that Amazon is using it to try to sell you stuff. And not all apps are available in the app store, just the ones Amazon wants you to see"
"It's a nice tablet for the price and I use it for a lot of things around the house , TV , tempeture"
Got these for Christmas presents. They were well received!
Bought this and a 128gb micro-sd card on Black Friday. Nice size screen that is clear and responsive.. Easy to setup and use. Good sound - better than my Galaxy S7. Battery last a very long time. Excellent tablet and e-reader.
Overall i like the tablet. However Amazon has set the lock screen with advertisements for their apps and books and you can't change that. I don't care about your ads Amazon!
This tablet was a excellent price for black Friday. Wish I had purchased two.
Great purchase for the $$$. Does what I use it for.
It is a nice product and it took some use to getting to versus my old kindle!
"My niece loves this tablet, and the product works far better than others items that we've bought for her."
Wonderful gift for my niece.She gets entertainment and also gets to use it to learn things.
Wonderful gift for my niece.She gets entertainment and also gets to use it to learn things.
I bought four fire tablets and each of them stopped charging immediately after the purchase. I wrote to Best Buy detailing the problem with the tablets and the fact I did not have insurance or the boxes to return the item. No response. Disappointed because I have made major and multiple purchases with this company. Won't make any more purchases from Best Buy.
This was purchased as a Christmas gift and I have not had any experience with it yet.
"I got the tablet for $50 but doesn't have the full Android operating system. Even with a software hack, not all the apps from Play Store were usable on this tablet. Returned it and got a Samsung Tablet."
"Okay; we know this is not an iPad so the horsepower is limited but at the $80 price point ($50 on sale as I write this and as I purchased it), it's a fantastic bargain.Don't let any reviews here claim that you can't run most Android apps (including the Google Play Store and its apps!). You just have to be a little crafty. Follow the instructions here: http://saintlad.com/install-google-play-store-on-kindle-fire/ ...and in 15 minutes, I had the Play Store, Play Books (which means all of the books I had uploaded there now were available on the Kindle). Sure, you can use Amazon's servicesKindle books, videos, buying stuff on Amazonbut you don't -have- to. Note that this unit has the lockscreen ads which, frankly, you see only for 2 seconds before you unlock it; so don't waste your money thinking you have to pay more for the non-ad version. Web surfing isn't as fast as on my iPad but it's fine, really. (And I'm a Mac person.)"
Not as good as iPad with accessibility but still gets the job done
Not really impressed by this item. It is pretty slow.
"Bought this for my parents as they have an aging 3rd Generation FireHD. That tablet cost well over $300 dollars but was limited to fireOS 4. I couldn't believe that their newest only cost $50 on sale with ads. I don't think it is worth it at their normal price of $80 dollars.FireOS 5 is pretty much just a skinned version of Android Lolipop. Since we are on Nougat now, they are about two years behind. Hopefully security updates are still being made for the device.The biggest disappointment was the screen. If you buy this for reading books, they really need to go back to the old 3/4 Gen HD Fire Tablets, as their screens are so much better. They claim IPS on this screen, but I don't buy it. Colors are washed out and pixel density is pretty poor.The blue light filter they have is pretty terrible compared to what Apple offers. It basically puts a semitransparent color over the entire screen. If something on the screen is already black, why does it need to look blackish orange? I don't fully fault amazon as this may be more of a limitation of Android, but still...Also I can't figure out how to get rid of the adds for the red version. In the past there was an option to pay a few extra dollars and they remove the promotion. Amazon's website doesn't offer the red without adds as of this writing, but they do with the black.Side load google play store for more up to date apps as a lot of the amazon store apps are long out of date."
"It's a decent tablet. Good size. Would be better if it could have google play loaded without going through hoops. I don't really like the UI, but it could be worse."
"This tablet is pefect for kid travel, reading digital comics, etc. It is just lo Iimited in processing speed."
Perfect size light weight and can conceal always..
"Bought it for $50 to replace my aging Kindle Fire HDX 7. Was excited about the size (1"" larger), faster processor, and expandable storage.I should have read the reviews. Comixology purchases only download to the internal storage, not external - 16 GB fills up after 8 downloads. The screen resolution is noticeably pixilated when reading text.Still, one star for value if bought for $50, one star for build (solid), and one if you're a Amazon Prime member & able to take advantage of video & music (which will download to external memory)."
"Returned within a week, did not like it. I didn't care for the ads every time I turned the tablet on."
"The Unit had good screen resolution and the size was not bad but, Not at all impressed with the Amazon operating system."
I think the charging port should be something more simple since this product is aimed at smaller children. We‚Äôve only had ours for a month and the port is broke. Getting a new one sent to us.
Good for reading but video quality is not so good.
Couldn‚Äôt use it for video chat with amazon show .. that was the reason for me to buy this tablet. Will return back
Kid enjoyed using it. It came in handy most of the time.
I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.
"Bought it for my 3 year old son. Physically the product is amazing! Love the case around it, and how amazon replaces the product if anything happens, no questions asked. However, the software is terrible. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but its hard to consider this as a tablet when everything is limited. I only use it now to play movies from an external SD card, which cannot be played via kids profile"
"Is a gift for Christmas, therefore not yet in use."
The Freetime so far isn't very intuitive and it looks like you have to be on the deivce. No web interface for it.
"This device fulfill a daily needs. You can use for a very basic thing like browsing, listening the music, watching movie or reading. The quality of the picture and the sound is not too bad. If you are a vet picky person.. this device will not work for you. The only cons for me is that this device can't connect to Tv."
"Cant download many apps, but its great for kids or for those who like to read."
Picture quality seemed grainy. We tried streaming video on amazon prime with it and it buffered some times even though we have an extremely fast Wi-Fi. For the price though it's not bad. We use it for our kid's apps
Not reaching my expectations and it's okay to kids to play games
This tablet is what it is for; a child. Overall its an alright tablet. Make sure you set up a parental control pin or you might get a nice bill to your credit card or just don‚Äôt associate your credit card on the tablet!
I love my fire tablet. I like that it was so easy to set-up. I love all the apps I can download. I use it to access Amazon prime books and videos. I use it to borrow books from the public library. This will save me money down the road.
Just wish i could lock the screen so my daughter cant exit apps!
This version is larger than the previous. We have had 3 of these now and purchase them as gifts for friends kids. Love that you can limit the screen time.
Very easy to use. Trying to motivate my son to read more. So far is working.
Very easy to use. Trying to motivate my son to read more. So far is working.
My 5 year daughter really likes this and I can put parental controls on it so I know what she is watching.
This one was purchased for my sister. I already have one and knew she would enjoy it.
Good for wifi users with affordable low cost. We can buy . Cam clarity is not good. That's cons.
This was a great tablet for my daughter at a reasonable price.
"This is exactly what my daughter wanted. Easy to use, great case for a 3 year old to drop. And an amazing no questions replacement via Amazon."
"This is exactly what my daughter wanted. Easy to use, great case for a 3 year old to drop. And an amazing no questions replacement via Amazon."
Used to have an iPad but I hated it became obsolete. I love my kindle fire and BestBuy was great!!!
Works great. Perfect for the age a lot of apps to download
This is by far the best tablet I've ever purchased for my little ones I love it so much and I'm definitely considering buying 1 more in the near future! (I have 2 already but I have 5 little ones all under the age of 10 who constantly fight over the 2 we have now lol)
Great for kids. Tons of content available. Perfect for learning and long car rides.
"Easy to hold, loves the pink case, and is able to play and recognize icons and age appropriate games. Great purchase for our 3 year old!"
"Rugged, good quality, many games to play and beginner books to read. My 5 yr old grand daughter absolutely loves it!"
"Tablet works great for a 7yr old. He has no trouble using it and playing with it. Simple entertainment for trips, car rides or when the weather is bad outside. Like the parental controls on it also."
We bought this for our 2 yr old grandson for Christmas. He just loves it. The protective case is very sturdy and can hold up to a toddler. Easy to you and kid friendly.
It's ok just right for our baby I like we can set a lot of parental blocks
Youd be silly not to buy this for a childs tablet. Comes with a no questions asked 2 yr warranty. Doesnt have special offer ads on it. Can be modded to provide Google play apps but you will miss out on the Amazon child filters for content. Durable and plenty powerful. Price is insanely cheap
I absolutely love this tablet. I got it for my 3 year old for Christmas so she wouldn't steal mine all the time. Great for kids i downloaded Netflix and I could download lots of movies and shows so she could watch in the car without having Wifi. Would recommend it to anyone with kids
"This was a gift for my 9 year old daughter. She LOVES my iPad, but I was skeptical on spending that much money on a tablet that may end up....floating in a tub, covered in permanent marker or play doh...you never know. The kids tablets are too juvenile for her. The cheap android tablets break so fast....I am a high Amazon fan, so I went for the Fire. She LOVES it!!! The HD display is better than the iPad mini4. I love how easy it was to set up, and that you can set Amazon family accounts now. She loves using Alexa for everything! I believe I may get myself one too!!"
So happy that you can add a micro SD card! This girl needs as much memory as possible!
"We buy the kindle fire for each of our grandkids as they get old enough and they love, love, love it!"
"This is awesome for kids, not too pricy, has a great case, and loads of parental controls."
"This is awesome for kids, not too pricy, has a great case, and loads of parental controls."
"Bought 2 of these for my grandkids for Christmas. These are perfect and with the sale I bought them on, even better. I liked the 8 since the screen is a little bigger plus more memory than the 7."
Love item for 2 year old
"I grabbed this when it was on sale for Black Friday because it was such a good price. I had a regular Kindle before & traded it in to Amazon with the intention of getting another regular Kindle but I never did. In the meantime I did get an iPad Pro & I thought that would function as my Kindle/e-reader. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my iPad. But the iPad Pro is just way too big to comfortably read in bed (12.9‚Äù) or carry around in my bag to have with me when I expect to be in a waiting room somewhere & might want a book or magazine. It‚Äôs also too big (and too expensive) to bring to the gym to set on the treadmill to watch a TV show while I workout. So I grabbed this Kindle hoping it would be everything my iPad is not. So far it does everything I need it to do. It was easy to set up right out of the box. I easily synced it with my Amazon account so I could pull my books, music, movies, & TV shows right from my Amazon account right away. I did add the Netflix and Hulu apps so I could watch some shows while I worked out. The screen is great. The picture is crisp and clear & way better than I expected. The sound is fantastic. It is easy to read on (which should be no surprise since that it was Kindles are made to do). I like that it integrates so easily with my Goodreads account. I haven‚Äôt spent much time browsing the web on it since that‚Äôs not what I bought it for. So I can‚Äôt speak to how it functions as a traditional tablet. But as an e-reader and media player, it is fantastic. I have had some issues with the SD card alerting me that it has been removed when it wasn‚Äôt, but some research showed me that it is not an uncommon issue with these Kindles & I‚Äôm hopeful that it will be resolved soon. Overall this is a great little tablet. It‚Äôs small & lightweight enough to just throw in my bag & have with me wherever I go. The size is perfect to read a book, but also a great size to watch a movie on when you‚Äôre on the go. It also feels pretty sturdy. I did buy a case for it, but I feel like it‚Äôs pretty solid on its own."
Granddaughter loved it. It was her favorite gift. She couldn‚Äôt wait to get it set up!
This was a great birthday gift for our 20s daughter. Just what she wanted
It‚Äôs really kid friendly and allows for total parental control. My 3 yr old was able to use it right outta the box.
Takes great pics. Easy to maneuver. Good screen size
bought and love the size compaired to the other sizes
Wanted a tablet easy to hold bigger than my phone smaller than laptop. This is perfect
I have finally found the perfect tablet! I got the new Amazon Fire HD8 in yellow! It was in my price range and the size is just right for me! It fits in my purse so I can take it with me everywhere I go.
"Bought for my son and he absolutely loves it. Good selection of games and plenty of factory space, can even install SD card for more if needed"
Cheap and best tab for kids.Good qualitygreat features
This is the perfect tablet for a beginner. It is sturdy and has everything he needs.
"I had originally tried getting an At&T or a Sprint tablet for my young daughter but she (or someone else) would inevitably end of breaking the screen and making the tablet unusable. Screen protectors would make the sensitivity too difficult for her to use and I couldn't ever find a good drop-proof protective case.I finally discovered the Amazon Fire Kids edition and wish I had known of this 3 broken tablets ago. Aside from the awesome drop-proof case, it has a nicely done custom kids view that removes all the things I don't want my daughter having access to (Youtube, the Google play store, web browsing). I already had one issue with it (99% certain it was my fault) but Amazon's ""Worry Free Guarantee"" had me a replacement tablet in 2 days for zero cost and no questions asked. If you have a young child you want to get a tablet for, this is it."

Excelent choice. I'm just missing the screenshot possibilty.
"I am highly recommending this product, top notch!!"
"Although this tablet is not really for everyday normal use due to some of its limitations, I was looking for a good replacement for a very old ipad that was slowing down. Picked this up for less than 40 dollars and really can't complain considering my last ipad was over 500. Good starting tablet or for those that do not need much,"
It was affordable but does not meet features that you need for videos callinh.
A good tablet for the price just need a bigger memory card
Addition of Google play store would be added value.
"For what it is, it's great. If you expect an iPad, you're not going to get it. It's a very capable tablet, and has a good variety of apps for the kids."
"For what it is, it's great. If you expect an iPad, you're not going to get it. It's a very capable tablet, and has a good variety of apps for the kids."
"When my mom mentioned initially that she wanted a tablet I never thought of getting her an Amazon tab. At some point she saw it and decided she wanted one The tablet, firstly is an Amazon tab so it doesn't automatically come with the Google play store which can be a bummer for persons who are used to an android system. I found a way around that so now her tablet has the Google play store. It does have annoying ads for books at times. Maybe that can be turned off. Not sure yet For the most part it definitely handles her demands which include banking, emails and YouTube so it's so far so good"
"Got this for my kids this xmas (3 yr old twins). They absolutely love it and have become very adept at navigating everything (ridiculously easy for them which is a little scary). They've dropped it many times and the cushion on this thing has paid for itself already. Lots of kid-friendly apps - although it seems like you can only pick from their set list of apps - this might be an android/amazon thing I haven't figured out yet. My only complaint is it can be a little slow sometimes, particularly with downloading apps. Sometimes it shows the icon for an app like you have it, but then when they click it the wheels start spinning and it begins downloading, and it takes a couple of minutes (whereas my iPad would do it in about 15 sec). I don't mind the wait, but 3 yr olds get impatient quick. At least it's teaching them patience if not anything else. :)"
I purchase as a gift for my daughter. She loves it.
"Bought this for my 87 year old mother-in-law who wanted to use something for word games, etc. She's still getting used to it but she'll learn."
Just right for my under 10 nieces and nephew. Great investment.
"I am the purchaser, not the user, but have owned a Kindle myself. These products are very reliable & easy to use."
"Was a perfect purchase to get her as she was getting tired of looking at stuff on her small phone screen, just a basic android tablet that has the benefits of others and at a really great price on black friday."
Great tablet for a low cost. Dependable and with all the Right Software.
Amazon product is everything you expect it to do. It has a nice sturdy feel incapabilities two rival some of the best out there. the only drawback is the proprietary operating system and method of downloading apps can seem a little bit clunky at times but with some playing around with you get used to it.
"Nice tablet to work - Works perfectly, Rock solid."
This product is very good to use .I recommend for my friends.Very easy to use
"Very good product, the touch sensitivity is excellent compared to recent one we have owned."
the person who received this tablet is enjoying such a big screen. They are still exploring all the new options.
"Love the Tablet. Great for reading, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify etc...My only gripe is the Amazon App store isn't as populated as the Google Play store. I use mine every day. Setup was a breeze and I got them for my whole family!"
I purchased this tablet because my classes required online textbooks and this tablet made it so easy to access everything I need. I love how lightweight it is and how I'm able to access the internet as well.
"This was a nice purchase for my son 8yr old, it performs well"
Better than the original tablet we lost. Was in stock & at a great price. Called & could pick up in a few hours
Have had an Amazon Fire for several years. Upgraded to a new one. Easy to use! Affordable!
Needed to get a replacement Kindle for my wife. Did a lot of research online about new generation models of Kindles and sizes. Best Buy had all the models and sizes in stock. And their price was the same as everyone else.
I returned this item because I couldn‚Äôt get a keyboard with a case to go with it.
Tried to watch youtube and other video from different sources but it was horrible. The sound would lag w or 3 seconds behind the viewing. Returned for Samsung S2 tablet which is wonderful. You get what you pay for.
"My 87 year old father used an earlier version for his reading enjoyment with limited tech ability. I got the 8"" version and it fits my hand and is an enjoyable and functional tablet."
We bought this for my son to watch his videos on the road when traveling and it has been a lifesaver. Very kid friendly.
"Bought for my 4 year old a few months ago, very rugged and kid friendly. He can navigate through the device without issues. Comes with a nice kid friendly case that keeps it safe from drops."
For the price. Its great!!! I would buy another one if it goes on sale again
No problems charging (yet) or holding a charge. Its only been almost a month so don't want to jump the gun yet.
Very pleased with the product and performance. Easy and fast to download content - such as movies and music. Took on a recent trip and now wished I had bought one sooner - fits right in back pocket of my DSLR camera bag. Only draw back was unexplained power loss - as described by other reviewers. After a day it came right back on - suggest it might be a recharging problem as after a full charge it is working fine again. For the price and content available - great buy.
Great tablet for kids and elders. Easy to use. Nothing fancy about it. It just gets the simplest of task done at a great price. Had for 1 week and it has had no issues.
"You really cant beat the value of Kindle Fire tablets. You get decent specs for under $80. The speakers are decent, the screen isn't bad, and there are quite a few apps available. Obviously this doesn't compare with the quality of an Ipad Mini (except the sound on this may be better than Ipad mini 2 and similar to Ipad mini 4), but you are paying 1/3 of the price as well. If you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, like my mother is, this is a great little tablet. I purchased this to replace my mother's 3 year old Kindle Fire HD7. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but the new one runs the newer apps much quicker."
Bright screen has micro ad port. Works with my 17 Gbyte card.
Great price for an easy to use tablet. Excellent for reading ebooks.
"I purchased this Kindle for my mother and she absolutely loves it. She can play games, look at the Internet and read books. Perfect."
"For the price, it is quite a nice tablet. I must admit there's little I've done with it for now, the goal being to get it to the kids to control their Lego Boost kit with it."
"nice slim design, easy to hold, easy to set up. bought for my husband...he just likes to browse the internet. great for him!"
When I finally opened and started the process it took forever to load apps but when it finally finished it was fine
Kindle fire is slow but love the fact my child is protected from some internet content
"good for doing some things and just a quick computer, try it"
1st Fire tablet. The color and screen are nice and bright. The ability to set the turn on time for night screen is nice.Miss not having some of the true Android apps like Firefox . May be the learning curve but the Silk browser header is always in the way.
This was to replace an earlier gen Kindle. That one would just shut down. We have not had any concerns with this and I will say I like the design better.
I fired up my Fire today. It seemed to go well very well.
"So far, so good, but I've only used it for 1 week. Would've like for some kind of handle for the cover so it's easier to hold for kids small hands."
"Context: Replacement for my old Nexus 7; bought during black friday/cyber monday sale.Pros:-Literally the only decent android tablet for its price.-Good battery life.Cons:-No access to google play apps/services (youtube, gmail, etc only via browser).-First one I purchased had a defective speaker - QC might be variable.Thoughts:Amazon's insistence on using their own app store/android version is annoying, as is the subsequent lack of core google apps. However, for the price there is very little competition among android tablets."
My 11 year old loves it. He likes the look and it loads videos quickly.
Much better than the cheaper $50 tablets out there.
"This is a solid tablet for the money, great size, easy to use"
"Great resolution for video. Easily connects to Firestick to throw what you are looking at on your tablet on to the TV. Easy interface. Amazon app store not as good as Google play, but close."
Bought this for my 3 year old. He absolutely loves it. It is easy for him to navigate
My son loves this tablet and so does his mom lol..
My son loves this tablet and so does his mom lol..
NOT REALLY NEEDED. I ALREADY HAD TWO AND DECIDED THREE WAS OVERLY ONE TOO MUCH.
"Quite complex and troublesome, with poor features. It does not store music or file and keep ponying to various sites"
"Resolution was great, speed was good. Bought for grandson, he didn't like it because it would not run Google apps and couldn't watch u-tube without purchasing additional apps."
"The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!"
I've finally found a tablet that fits the needs of my granddaughter.
Super nice and affordable great price excellent quality and works just as good as an iPad or android tablet
"Bought it for my kids. Never bought Amazon tablets before because Youtube kids is a must have. However, installing Google Playstore, framework and services was surprisingly easy and from there was just easy. There was an excellent list of games and entertainment on Amazon store and integration with my Prime account was extremely simple. Price point for the performance and quality of this tablet $49.99 8"" 16GB & $79.99 32GB) against most other ordinary name tablets which are $100+ is outstanding. Presence of ads and other material really isn't a problem and well worth the discount I'm very happy."
"Purchased for my grandson for Christmas. Comes charged and ready to setup. Setup process is relatively painless, though it does require an Amazon account and payment source. The display is bright and sharp and response snappy. Available memory from the indicated 16 GB is around 10 GB after stock apps and operating system space allotted. For daily use that should be sufficient but downloaded content (not necessarily application) can be stored on a micro SD card (not included). All in all I'm very pleased with this purchase. Should my opinion change after Christmas, I'll let you know. ;)"
Absolutely love the product my first child had one. My second child asks for one .Now on my fourth kid and they want the same one. Nice product . And my husband do not mind getting it for the price .
Best tablet ever and our daughter loves the different color.
Best tablet ever. Great for kids. You can put tons of apps on it.
Bought this for my son and he loves it. And I love that he can throw it around and not break!
I love how it helps my sister with her homework and have her entertained.
"Not a good tablet for kids. To avoid ads from appearing, you must pay 15 dollars."
Perfect to use with the firestick...my daughter will be so happy with her Christmas present!
Upgrade for my granddaughter she loves the color and she likes watching her movies on it
Was looking for a reasonably priced tablet for the kids. Comes with a protected case and easy to use
We have only had this product for about a month and there's already a problem with the charging port. Having to send it back. My Daycare owns 3 of them for her own children and their having the same problems with two of there's.
Good quality tablet that does what it needs to do for not alot of money
"I purchased this tablet for my girlfriend who had the original Amazon Tablet that just stopped working. So from what she says it's really fast, easy to use, loves the Alexa and claims that the picture quality is amazing."
Got the tablet for my mom for christmas! She absolutely loves it!!
I bought for one of my children. They really like it. Simple to use and inexpensive
"I mainly got this to have a bigger screen to read my news on. My favorite news app refused to open! Only good was that I have amazon prime. However, I returned the fire tablet and got the iPad 2017. Much happier with that!!"
Awesome tablet for beginners and pros for surfing and basics .
"Is my Best divice. Internet uses for social media, online music, reading, clud storage, photo, etc."
My grandkids love Thur tablets they are a very sturdy educational tool to have they keep them very calm and it's less fighting I have blue for the boys and pink for the girls they are absolutely the best and the price was awsome ....Thanks Best buy
"If you‚Äôre on a budget or media consumption is your only use, then this is the best you can get. The Amazon bloat can slow down the device, not to mention the restrictions imposed but at this price, you get what you pay for"
"Its a perfect device and secure device for kids, just love it."
This one has a beautiful screen I love the 8 inch HD. It's as nice as any fire I've ever had and I've had three. I particularly love listening to books but don't always want to pay the audio book prices. His Kindle has is going to voices any ever has but it's mostly the same as the last fire they came out before it. I love the different color choices and I love the kid's case the best even for a grown-up. You can't beat the price for an android tablet and also it goes on sale now and again and get even cheaper and more affordable.
This tablet is amazing. Just easy to use and for $49.99 you can't beat the price.
I HAVE ALOT OF MOVIES AND VIDEOS THAT I HAVE TO STORE AND THE 32 GB REALLY IS A GREAT FEATURE
"after downloading the Nook app, I now have both a kindle reader and Nook reader in the same device"
For 50 bucks you can't do better than this. It's quite the tablet
"I bought this for my special needs son. He keeps kissing it saying,"" I love you tablet"". Could not be happier. Setup is a breeze. Very easy forkids to use and enjoy."
My kids were using ipods that would no longer work with some newer apps. These were cost effective upgrades. They use them constantly for games and netflix. I was able to get the google play store app installed for games not available on Amazon.
Fire is great for books also good for photos and google
I got this for my boyfriend for a Christmas gift. He liked it but doesn't use the internet much & has a smart phone so I returned. It's good for someone looking for something basic
My tablet is worth the money I spent. Great job!!!
This has been pretty easy for my kids to use and navigate. They really like it.
"This tablet is great for kids. I love all the different kids content available. The only negative thing I have noticed so far is that at time it will freeze up and I end up having to reboot to fix it. So far, that's the only issue."
My son love's his tablet he uses it for reading and playing games
This was a gift for grandkids. I'm hearing that they are very happy with it.
This was a gift for grandkids. I'm hearing that they are very happy with it.
This one has not gave us any trouble unlike the one my daughter uses. My son loves playing his kid friendly games
this item is very conv. for the time to read a good book or just to let the book read to you.
I bought this for my son and he is able to easily navigate along safe for Kids!
OK for the price. Used for games and checking emails. Haven't explored other uses at this time
Not enough features. It's to simple. When parental control is on it's not much you can do on the tablet not even use the camera
We have our son Christian with autism he needs a tablet that can with stand being dropped these TABLETS are tough as nails.

"We have had cell phone service tablets for years, our kids need kid tablets. We bought 2! So cute and a great price..."
I had an older Kindle Fire and thought the transition to this one would be smooth. I was even encouraged to turn in my old one one the spot. After cleaning up the old one and saving the old files on the cloud I thought....I bought this updated version to find that it does not recognize the old files....so much for it being saved on the cloud. Then instead of it having an ad whenever I turn it on....ads also clutter the screen with the apps. I was happier with the older model and regret turning it in for a credit....which somehow dropped $10 in value in the time it took me to prep it before I deregistered it. If you didn't have an older model you probably will be happy with this one.
I have had this product less than 6 months. It shut down unexpectedly and would not restart. I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty.
Well pleased with this upgrade purchase for husband! He loved his Fire 7 & loves his Fire HD 8 even more!
Wife loves her Kindle and has used it for years. Thought it was time to update to take advantage of new features and bigger display.
Had the smaller version decided to upgrade to the next size!
Upgraded my old Kindle when Best Buy offered this on a Flash Deal for 49.99 great buy. like the alexa function makes navigation much easier
I purchased the Kids kindle because of the warranty plan. Thinking it's the best deal for the money. I find it in no way user friendly for my ha me or my 3 year old granddaughter! She can take my iPad go strength to her folder.

using it as a head unit in my jeep bought a rugged case and it works great
"Amazon Fire HD8 is a good tab at this price. It's light in weight, easy to use and serves a good purpose for browsing and reading. But if you are looking for a good camera or a tab for video calling, this is not the right choice for you"
.. TAKES GREAT QUALITY PICTURES. WILL BUY AGAIN. LOVE IT.
Much faster and clearer than our fire 6. Really easy to use!
Great to use for my little one. She loves it awesome
Great to use for my little one. She loves it awesome
Purchased this for my children they love it varies the navigate for them holds a charge well
I got this for my daughters 5 birthday. Better than her old leap pad. I think she enjoys it more because the display is more like my phone. VERY happy kid!!
Good gift for kids. My son likes to play the educational games i downloaded for him
"This is a nice one, very fast and smooth for daily operation."
Amazon fire tablet is an outstanding piece of equipment. Strongly recommend.
"so far my mom loves it it was gift for her, it's fast and simple"
"My son loves his ""tabwet"" lol. Hes got plenty of PJ Masks episodes and games plus much more."
"My son loves his ""tabwet"" lol. Hes got plenty of PJ Masks episodes and games plus much more."
"My wife's Ipad Mini had issues, she wore it flat out, and wanted to get another one but did not want to spend the money on a new iPad, so we gave this one a try. After BB Reward Zone $ I got it for about $100ish with 32gb of memory.To be clear, this is not on the same level as the iPad mini but it was not designed to. Technical specs not quite as good but for $100ish dollars from a reputable company it is not bad at all. The first thing to note is that it does not come with the ability to download from the Google Play Store. You can can get around this by side loading Google and there are plenty of websites to tell you how to this very easily.My wife has been burning it up with this tablet and she really likes it. She can let go of some of the shortcomings vs the iPad mini. Overall she likes it, which is good.So if you are wanting an inexpensive tablet from reliable company, try the Fire tablet."
I have a long time with the battery life.. love the fire tablet
"I bought this computer a 32 GB fire for $79 and I love it.I don't do much on it but; emails, play games both on and off line, and go online for other social media like youtube etc.It takes pretty good pictures. It comes on a little slower than I would like, but it is a great buy for me. Once it comes on it is very fast."
"Very good product, Good price, I would recommend this product"
"Good tablet for surfing the internet, shopping online, or games."
When I purchased the Amazon fire tablet I was not expecting it to do everything that my iPad mini did before I broke it but this tablet is a little bit better to me with getting on sites quickly
"Kid was buggin me for a tablet, he already cracked the screen on a couple of other Ipads, this one is a whole lot cheaper and works just about the same."
Very good first tablet for kids without breaking the bank. Have had no issues and the kids love them (ages 3 and 5)
Its a very nice tablet if you use it for basic stuff. And does alot if things. I love it
Our daughter loves it. Has helped keep her engaged with the games and shows while traveling and running errands
This is a great tablet. Very convenient. Great for instant access to information and the Internet when you don't want to fire up a desktop. Lots of software apps are available for downloading.
Bought for my son and he loves it. The price was great and the features are awesome. Thinking about one for myself in the near future.
Got this for my daughter when it was on sale. She really likes it. It seems to be slow charging but the battery lasts a long time.
A very nice movie watching tablet. Perfect size for watching in bed
This is handy to have for quick searches and candy crush.
Very satisfied with this product. It is actually for my husband. He uses it mainly with his ‚Äúyou-tube‚Äù videos. Loves it. Always in it. It lasted longer than the last one he got from another competitor.
It's 2017 no reason this tablet cannot produce clear 1080 or higher resolution. I get it it's cheap and for that it's good but it just feels cheap and omg so manny pop up adds.. Comeon amazon
For the most part the Kindle 8 is a great deal for the money. The volume was giving me a problem but it was resolved quickly by Amazon. Overall quite happy
Had the smaller Kindle for years and now I'm enjoying the Kindle 8 with the additional features.
"Had been shopping for an e-reader, checking them all out, reviews, etc., and decided to just check out the tablets. Came across the Fire HD 8. Many more uses, versatile, really good as an e-reader, AND a lower price. Very satisfied with this purchase."
Was able to do majority of our Christmas shopping at Best Buy. Bought three Kindles for presents.
"Waste of money,You tube does not work on these tablets,so everything from there old tablet does not work on the new ones,so going back to the old ones and sending these back"
We enjoy them. They are easy to use. We would recommend
"This our first tablet so can't really compare them to all I know is we are enjoying them great for reading, games checking e-mail ."
I bought this item for a gift. I've owned one for years and i have no complaints. I mostly use mine for reading books and playing games.
"Works great for reading books, searching the web and some games."
"Bought this for my wife to replace a Nexus 7 that had seen much better days. This is part of the Amazon ecosystem of course, but she has found it to be a great, intuitive tablet that fulfills all of her modest tech needs."
"Cannot provide feedback, it is currently wrapped for Christmas. Will be a gift for an 8 year old"
"Best Amazon tablet I've ever owned. While it can't quite beat out my Kindle Voyage for reading, that's hardly a crime."
"I can't believe how much I can do with this. I read the Washington Post every morning. I watch BritBox and Netflix on it. I read books, go online, take photos, play games. I would recommend this for anyone."
I have a 7 inch Kindle but this is larger with clearer picture
Limited time by Mom but she says he loves it a lot
Limited time by Mom but she says he loves it a lot
"Not only I'd we get a larger screen size but, also doubled memory."
I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.
We bought the 16Gb 7‚Äù tablet for my daughter two years ago and she loved it and still makes use of it. We got these two for her and our son as they are a little bigger and has more space. Can‚Äôt wait to see their faces on Christmas Day. The free time subscription offers a lot of content and for a few dollars a month it‚Äôs worth it. Also the ability to lock down what they watch and for how long is a great feature.We can say only after reading books for 30 mins then can videos be played. My wife and I both love these tablets for our kids.
So many new features compared to my old Kindle from 4yrs ago
Speakers stuck on this thing . I bought it to give to my grandma but she found it too difficult.
"The tablet itself works great, but be aware, this is one that comes with ads as your home screen... nowhere did it say that it had ads..."
"I didn't need a super expensive tablet, I just needed a basic one for couple different apps I needed. This one works perfect. Need a basic tablet for Netflix or Hulu or Amazon this works great. But don't expect it to be Ipad."
We bout this kids kindle actually for my mother with dementia. It is simple enough for her to use yet protects her from unwanted purchases and becoming too overwhelmed. The cover is a nice touch and there are pre-loaded games and apps. Not really worth the price difference though. I did it for connivence sake but probably a better investment to purchase a regular kindle and the case separately. I'm sure there's an app or settings that can make any device kid-friendly. The screen is clear and there's no lag when pushing buttons.
"I purchased this to replace my older tablet that was starting to slow down. So far this one is working fine. There is an advertisement at the beginning, but that‚Äôs not a big deal for me."
My son loves it. Very easy for him to use. It's pretty durable as well.
Amazing tablet for the money. Gave one to my wife for Christmas and she loves it
Bought at best buy because I had a rewards certificate. Didn't have color I wanted but still works great.
I bought 4 of these tablets this Christmas as gifts and they work as expected
"Old fire tablet finally died. Got this one at Best Buy, didn't have to wait two days....and was same price...Works better than old one too."
"Purchased for my mother, easy to set up and works great!"
Works great! Ton's of space for my books. Great portability.
It's a descent tablet for basic web browsing and videos.
Works great. I have no complaints with this item. My grandaughter is happy with it.
Easy to use. Great for checking out books from library .
had one before but it went wacky after 5 years. seems to work well so far.
"The Kindle Fire works well and I enjoy reading on it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems silly to restrict people from reading Nook books on it just because it is a different platform. As a book lover, I like supporting bookstores not only the almighty Amazon. Yes, I know there are ways to get around the restriction. The reason to reduce a point is not based on the excellence of this Kindle, but on politics of sharing."
Easy to set up. I havent given it to my daughter yet... as I am afraid she will turn into a screen freak but I will be using it for lo g car rides.
"was easy to setup, got connected on wifi, then started downloading books"
"I bought for wife and she loves it. Not as good as Ipad but for the price one could not get better. Battery lasts and no game crashes. Prime is a plus for all the perks. No need to install Google Play, Prime store rocks."
"For $49, this is perfect for my game room. I can utilize vs. my smaller iPhone screen. Wish I wasn‚Äôt bouncing between OS‚Äô, but at this price, STEAL!"
I love it. I‚Äôm so glade they made this tablet with protection. Love that my child can watch movies learn and play kid games.

"First, the bad. I hate the advertisements and the fact that you can't access the vast library of Android apps via Google Play. Nevertheless, you can do most of the things on the Internet that you need to while still have access to Amazon Fire-friendly apps that will keep you informed and entertained. The good news is that the HD8 has an expansion slot for a microSD card and increasing storage space is where the Fire HD8 dances all over the iPad. Add in a 128GB microSD card and you'll have tons of room for audiobooks, ebooks, music files, photos, and videos. The HD8 also has Amazon Alexa in case you're looking for automated help to shop or move around from interest online or on your Kindle Fire.It's a good buy - especially if you buy one when they are on sale!"
Bought for grand daughters birthday after her tablet broke. She loves it! Only downside she can not get on YouTube. Love that it coverts to a parent tablet as well.
I‚Äôm happy I got this tab for my daughter as a Xmas gift she‚Äôs in love with it!
Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.
This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better.
"First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.
"This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations."
I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.
this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.
"Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements."
I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.
Our 3rd Amazon fire. The battery life is outstanding. Really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery. Nice size.
Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size.
"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She reads books and plays games.
This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
"This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device."
"The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos."
a gift. He LOVES it. was a reasonable price. thks.
I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers.
This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.
The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.
"I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
I purchased for reading. It has been everything I have expected.
Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.
"Awesome.. Everything I need and more. I'm very happy with the tablet.I'm very happy.Thank you,Kathleen Stroyek"
I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!
Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.
I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!
"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
"If you are a Amazon Prime member, this is one of the best tablets to have, awesome!"
for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.
Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
"After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
very good tablet .i like it. but regulation is little low.
I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!
My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
"This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends."
I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.
"It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her."
Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
He and his wife are delighted with it and the acess to the huge number of books available.
"Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer."
I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
"Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices."
I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
"This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
"My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.
"23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her."
This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.
My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
"This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
"This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.
"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.
A good product that provides the services I desire.
I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.
Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.
"Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use."
"The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process."
Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too
I am happy to have udated my fire! I love having the camera work the way it should. WAy to use.
I love it. It is so easy to use and great apps to.
"purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!"
"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price."
This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.
Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.
"I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use."
This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.
Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.
I brought to my 2 nices and so far they are enjoy it ....
Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!)
I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.
"Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
This tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on.
"Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast."
"Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
"This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use
"This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version"
I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
bought it for my son. he likes it. very good alternate to expensive tables out there.
I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.
I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.
Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase
You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good
"I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet."
We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.
Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
It's a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it's not what I was thought it's going to be I returned it back just be of this reason
"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
"convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.
I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!
I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
I'm normally an Apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the Amazon Fire is.
"I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader."
Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.
I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it
Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet
"Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy"
Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
Liked the first one so much I bought one for the wife
Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
Nice device I like to use it to read books online.
Kids love it! Great Christmas present even if not an apple product.
Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
"Bought this for my 3rd grader when her school suggested to parents to get a tablet, they use them occasionally in school. This inexpensive one fits the bill just fine."
"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
"I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
"I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes."
"I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.
We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
My son uses the device to help him do his homework
"I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy."
"Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
"Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small."
Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
"Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.
It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
"Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics"
The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.
my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.
"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook"
My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear
Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
"I am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price"
Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.
I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
"Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge."
This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.
This tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users. Not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users
"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
"Good tablet for the price, and excellent for kids."
This tablet is perfect for my six year old's learning apps.
"For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good"
This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.
Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
"This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account."
"I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top
"It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine"
"Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
"We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!
Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.
Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.
I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend.
Like how I was able to buy a version with more memory. Love this works great.
"The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use."
This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun
"I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games."
This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.
Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
"I'm very pleased with my Kindle fire. I've used it more than I thought I would, as I primarily was getting it for reading, but wanted the internet access and ability to review and edit documents, too. In addition to reading more lately than I usually do, I'm also turning my Fire on instead of my desk top computer if I'm only going to use it a short time."
I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
"Love my kindle it's the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating"
My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
"I got it just for my son and he can get on and play games and watch videos no problem, the parental controls are amazing and keep him in his specific apps"
Bought these for all the grandkids for Christmas. Basic enough for a 10 year old but with enough features and capability for the 18 year old!
Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
"I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money."
"I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is ""Mom, you are the best"", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!"
I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.
"I'm enjoying my amazon fire. I've been reading great books, checking my e-mail and shopping.I highly recommend this product..value great quality great.You won't be disappointed."
Bought for my children. Holds plenty of apps. Safe to use with parental controls. Pretty durable but definitely recommend buying a screensaver and case for it.
I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
"Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy"
I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.
"My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
Love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what I needed it for great price
screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them."
I bought this to stream HD music via bluetooth to my stereo. Works great and for the price offered can't be beat.
"Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.
"If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!
"Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound."
"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus. Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas
I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.
"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store."
My kids read books play games take pictures they love this.
Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol
Grandkids and adult parents love it. The parents texted and the grandkids play games.
"Excellent price for a tablet. Hit for my daughter, she loves it!"
Very happy with my purchase. The tablet works amazingly good for the price.
I love my amazon fire. This is the best product I've ever bought. I can get any books I want for way cheaper than they are on store.
Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints.
I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.
I bought this tablet for my kids to watch videos and use mostly educational games on it and they love it.
"A great Christmas gift, great for listening to music"
Bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself
easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty
"Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
"I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose."
"My daughter loves it, except that she can't connect to her chromecast"
Purchased this for 6 year old boy and couldn't be happier
This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.
Got for reading Amazon books. Works great. Would recommend.
Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position.
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. Works great.
my son loves it and is easy to use and has parental controls so he can't buy stuff without permission
My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places
"Small enough to carry every where. When he is using it, you can hear a pin drop."
Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
"Easy for reading, easy to hold - can send emails, takes pictures - must be connected to WIFI to get setup."
"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain."
"Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen"
This product is great! It is great for those that enjoy using it for reading but also for entertainment. It is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show.
I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.
links up with up local library. good to read in sunlight. can check web and emails. close to having a tablet but have to figure out what apps work with amazon.
I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them.
I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.
"It has been useful for college looking up information I don't understand and for downloading books. It is also great for downloading apps such as Facebook, messageer, yahoo, google, Google maps, and the weather. It has also been great for downloading games."
My kids love them. Able to do so many things with it!
Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank
"Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet."
I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.
This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!
This device really allows you to use it for multiple reasons. It's a tablet and kindle all in one. I love this device.
It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology.
Bought this as a surprise gift and the recipient loves it!
"bought this as a christmas gift for our son, it holds a lot of games and is very easy to use"
I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
"My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price."
"Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it. The speed, ease of use and size were perfect for him. He mostly uses it for music, youtube and instagram..all of which seem to work fine on it. It was also very affordable. He's happy with it so we are too."
Purchased these for Christmas gifts. Assuming they were satisfactory because I didn't hear of need for returning. Purchased as angel tree gifts for preteens.
"This tablet was a gift for my father-in-law and is his first tablet ever. He is really enjoying getting to know his way around it. It's definitely user friendly and perfect for reading, music, and things like that!"
Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family.
"I bought the fire because I had heard it was a good tablet. So when I bought it, I was wondering if it lived up to the hype. It does. Its fast and easy to use. I put Netflix on it and watch series I missed. Only downside is that I had to register for a trial of prime."
"The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook."
Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it
Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle
Great product would recommend it this to others. Have a great picture.
"I believe this' a great item, my sister has 1 and we liked it that's what prompt us to get one"
"I wanted to upgrade my Kindle Fire - First Edition. This one is really nice. Graphics are superb as is the speed in loading. I don't know, yet, what else it can do as I haven't explored it thoroughly. It's like a mini lap top and has a camera that takes very clear pictures and has wireless connection to the internet."
Easy to use. Like all of the features. Lightweight.
This is my first fire and I love it! It is perfect for taking my books on the go without having the large bulky books!
"Got this for my9 year old so he could play mine craft and other little games. Does well, durable and easy to operate."
"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.."
Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
"For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse!"
I like the way I can read many books and magazines as well as play various games on my kindle.
Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.

Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.
Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............

Great product! I will recommend this to all of my family and friends.
"Great product. Excellent for small business, kids etc. Good on the go."
Product is great. Plenty storage for lots of books
"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
"The product was for my daughter, she loves it, and plays with it all of the time."
The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.
"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy."
This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.
"We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it."
bought kindle for my wife she uses it for everything especially reading. loves it.
This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.
I'VE had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low I knew I wanted to purchase another one. It can be used for a variety of uses.
Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
"Bought one of these two weeks before on Amazon and paid almost double for what Best Buy had these for. So, i bought another one the same day as this!"
Great functionality and quality for the price. I've bought several of these for customer giveaways and have yet to hear a complaint!
"Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too"
This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
"Purchased as a gift, the recipient is very happy and surprised with the performance, thinking of buying another one for myself."
This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.
Works great! Just the right size. Would recommend to family and friends.
The product is very durable and is great for children
I bought this for my daughter who uses it in her AP classes...easier to use a bigger screen than her phone screen in class. She loves it!Price was great!
The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.
Easy to use at home or lunch at the office. The only problem I have is that you have to restart often. Great while using public transportation.
So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.
this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck
Great steelbook for a great movie. this steelbook is amazing
Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.
"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."
Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.
"Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value!"
"Decent camera, clarity on the screen, fast downloads."
Easy to use and set up. It is the best tablet for reading books or listening to audiobooks.
Faster and good quality for this kind of brand ...
"For a basic tablet, this is perfect. Good price. Does all I need it to!"
For the price this does a lot. Purchased as a gift for my mother who is in here 70's. She loves that she can play her games and download books to read when ever she wants. Great value.
For the price this is a great tablet. Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
Gave as a gift to niece in hospital she loved it. Was able to do everything on the tablet she wanted to. Easy to use I was the one who set it up for her was very simple.
Gave this product to my nephews and they love it. Easy to carry and easy to use.

"Great tablet for the purpose of reading, also inexpensive"
Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too.
"Great tablet, so affordable and an awesome service!"
Great Tablet. My Grandson never wants to put it down. He plays it for hours and the rubber case really protects it because he is rough with it.
I am using it for my 3 year old and she loves it..
I bought this because I recently signed up for Amazon Prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books. Nice tablet.
"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong."
I bought this tablet to replace my textbook. It has everything I want and need. I only purchased it after I learned you can download from google play. The amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games.
I bought two of these for two of my children. The parental controls are great and I can easily control their access to content. The ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. This tablet does everything I wanted it to do.
I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!
I had a Kindle Fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. Could not be more pleased with this tablet.
"I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader."
"I have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids, in the past, however, the sales associate recommend this tablet, and it was only 10 dollars more. So far, I am really impressed by the difference in quality."
"I love my Amazon Fire tablet, I bought this all the while knowing that people had negative reviews... But honestly I don't know what they did to theirs because mines doesn't have any issues... I've had mines for over a month and still working perfectly like I just bought it yesterday..."
"I love this tablet,I use it for school readings ,for my philosophy class , my Mac book is to delicate to take to school,but my fire tablet is perfect !"
I love this tablet. It is the right size and I love playing movies on it.

I would highly recommend this kindle. It is user friendly and not to big. But large enough to see easily
It's so easy to use and fun! I watch shows on Netflix and MTV apps
Its a great tablet for a low price. There are thousands of apps and electronic books to read.
My 5 year old loves his tablet. It's perfect for him.
My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.
"The Kindle Fire is nice to use as a tablet to play games and surf the web as well as download and read books on. It has good speed, keeps a good charge and is affordable."
"The tablet is great overall. Its fast, smooth and many options to check out with regards to apps and programs. Great also if you have an Amazon account and also Kindle as well."
"This is a great entry tablet, if you do not want to dish out a few hundred dollars you should look into a fire table."
This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate

This tablet has been wonderful for my 8 yr old son. The parental controls are perfect for making sure he doesn't purchase the wrong things.

"This was a gift , was able to talk to an associate and was offered the Amazon tablet at a great price. I'm so thankful for Best Buy and it's knowledgeable sales associates."
We only use it for streaming Hulu and playing a few games but it's held its own so far.
We've had this tablet for about a month and have no complaints. Great tablet for a kid with lots of storage for games!
Works Great! Love the screen sharpness. Very easy to use.
I replaced another Kindle Fire that was broken after I sat on it! I liked all the Fires that I have had so much that I bought another and it is still in use.

The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
"This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore, it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet."
"I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I made a wise purchase"
It's great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it!
"We have always been Nexus Tablet desciples, and in fact have bought 6-8 of them for self and family members. This one was for granddaughter to replace Nexus that had gotten slow.This one works better/faster than the Nexus! It's fast....easy to use; perfect tablet for a child or teenager...and can't beat the price!Very pleased with purchase...."
"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets."
It has everything he needs. He is using the tablet each day.
For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place.
I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one
"Boxed well, easy to set up, and pretty easy to get the hang of."
"Works great with good storage but, lacks online browsing speed."
"My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help"
I bought this tablet for my 10 year old grandson. He loves it! It is very easy to operate and has a great display.
"I bought this Kindle because I needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 8-5 schedule. And so far, no complaints! Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."
"read the reviews, bought this tablet to replace an e-reader. Way more than I expected. Video was better than reviews stated, books load faster than my old one Still getting used to a new OS but I am very pleased"
This tablet is perfect for travel! Recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on Netflix. Great first tablet!
I bought this tablet as a 13th birthday present for my niece. She loves it and takes it everywhere. She reads books and watches Netflix just to name a few things you can do with this tablet.

"My granddaughter loved her tablet and the color. It's amazing how easy it is for her to use, perfect birthday gift"
Bought this tablet to read books and it also has other good qualities.
"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
"Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great."
great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen

I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it's great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
My 6yr old son loves the tablet!I plan on purchasing another Fire tablet!
This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!
Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also
You couldn't get a better buy for $59 than the Amazon fire 7. Paid the extra $20 to get the 16gb. Well worth it.
Great tablet. Drop it many times and its still working.
The graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected!
"It has a clear screen, the books are easy to download, I like the other features as well."
"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great"
"Replaced a kindle 6 that crashed so fare everything is great. Larger screen fast response,more storage. Don't have to charge as often. Well pleased."
"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
"Great value, just the right size and weight. Suits my needs perfectly. Performs very well. Easy to get accessories to fit."
I purchased this for my husband as a replacement for his old one. He is very hay with it.
This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.
This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.
Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant.
"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
"Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly!"
I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it!
My son LOVES it! Easy to use and download books. Requested for his Birthday gift.

I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.
The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much

The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.

I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!
I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
Bought it for my 8 yr old for Christmas and he loved it. I like that some of the apps that come with it can be deleted making more room for apps you would want to add.
I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.
"I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner"
My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!
I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
"Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words."
I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
For a cheap starter tablet it's fine. Bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that.
I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation
"I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account."
Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games
We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.
My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy
It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it
"The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!"
I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
"Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
"I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome ."
Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
"Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!"
"Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen."
"I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet!"
I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.
"Love this product, and don't know why it took so l"
Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me.
was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
Great device. Travels well. Easy to navigate. Would recommend.
I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great
I love my tablet. It is easy to use and it was ready to go when I turned it on.
It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time
it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price
Love it will recommend it to my friends.Found it to be as good as having a I pad.You can take good photos and face time as well as text.A vary llite tablet that comes in a number of colors.You can also use it out doors because it has a polarizing filter.
Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now!
my dauther loves the tablet and I can get the SD to get more storage and load up all the disney movies that I purchased. it is a great purchase.
Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use
So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.
The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family.
Wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse. Very easy to use. Would buy again.
Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.
"battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint."
fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.
"This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps."
"I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone ."
"I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them."
"I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my ""library"" that's not taking up space on my phone."
My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows
"I debated on what tablet/reader to buy and decided on the fire! I have been very pleased with it. Bought it on sale, what a great price!"
bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!
Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas
Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.
Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
"Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect."
I bought two of these for my 82 year old mother and 88 year old aunt - they love them! Easy to use! Great gift. Can't wait to buy one for me!
Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.
"I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it."
"Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read."
Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.
My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.
I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.
Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
"This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!"
best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
"My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at."
"I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them."
"This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point."
I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.
"I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
"Bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. He loves it. Couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."
My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.
This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
"Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!"
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
"This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable"
Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
"This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere."
My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
"We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
"Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced"
Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!
loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect
I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.
"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.
Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
"Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!"
"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
"Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
"This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
Perfect for my granddaughter birthday. She loves to read. So many books
Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...
My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
So happy with the color choices! This will be perfect for my 10 year old and I am thrilled with thr price!
"I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it."
"Purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. Perfect size. The front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added FB, sharing photos was easy. Amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of Kindle books. There are Amazon ads on the Kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device."
"This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy."
"PERFECT SIZE FOR TRAVELING, COMPACT AND LIGHT, AMAZON APPS ARE INCLUDED, GREAT FOR STREAMING VIDEOS AND SHOWS ON THE GO!!!!"
we had an older model from 2012 and it broke so we just replaced with newer one. Love the new features.
"Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase."
"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
"Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
"So far, so good. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn't anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable."
"I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
I only bought this as a travel companion when I fly. It was cheap and functional.
The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!
"I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!"
Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
"Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device."
"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues
Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.
Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
"Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven't put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!!"
I gave it away. It was too nice for me. The person I gave it to was gleeful.
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
"I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....
Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.
"Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one."
This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.
"So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books."
This Fire worked great but I returned it because it was not the one I wantedBest Buy took it back for a full refund with no problems Best Buy is alsome
Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
"It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate"
Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!
"The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
"I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music."
Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.
I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.
My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.
I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
"The best product name on the market,no doubt about it."
I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
"Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games."
It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.
Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
"Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent."
"There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app."
"I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
"I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
My daughter loves it. She loves the books that she can read.
"I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod"
Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.
Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
"I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!"
I love the touch screen aspect still love the original.
"(accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one."
Brother in law loves it. He's not very technical so perfect for him.
My second one and works better than the first one.
"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
"This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet."
"Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!"
The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
"I already have the Amazon Echo so this was just an additional one for my office. I think these gadgets are great. Set alarms, timers, get your local weather and who won the game last night. It can do too many things for me to list. It's great for everything however not great for music. I do listen to my local radio station on it - but compared to its' BIGGER brother Echo the sound is not that good."
Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.
"First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
"This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself."
"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
"This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.
"This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations."
I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.
I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.
"Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements."
I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep.
I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games
Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.
Our 3rd Amazon fire. The battery life is outstanding. Really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery. Nice size.
Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size.
"This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy."
"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She reads books and plays games.
This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.
"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
"This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device."
"The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos."
a gift. He LOVES it. was a reasonable price. thks.
"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers.
This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.
The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
I love my new Fire tablet. Nice backlight helps me to read my E-book in bed. Background color can be changed. I especially like the black background with white lettering; less glare on my eyes while reading.
It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.
Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs.
"I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device
I purchased for reading. It has been everything I have expected.
Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.
I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!
The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it
Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.
Bought this for my mom who is in her 70's. It's perfect and easy to use for the older generation.
I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!
"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works
Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.
Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.
"After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
very good tablet .i like it. but regulation is little low.
I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!
I'm very tough on dishwashers and this one seems to be up to the challenge! I will never own another brand!
My 4 Year old grandson likes to play games and watch movies. This was the best ever purchase I've done.
My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
"This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends."
I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
"The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!"
I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.
"It's a nice upgrade from the 6"" screen. Size is just right for small kids hands. Reading kindle books is much easier."
Watch it over & over again!!! Blu ray is the best!
This is a great devise for reading books or taking photos. Best Buy Associate was very helpful.
bought for daughter in law and she likes it. she wanted a fire
"It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her."
Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
He and his wife are delighted with it and the acess to the huge number of books available.
"Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer."
Love this kindle excellent price I just carry it everywhere. Fits perfectly in my purse.
I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
"Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices."
Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.
I bought it for my fianc and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
"This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
"My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.
"23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her."
This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.
My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
"This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
"This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.
"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.
A good product that provides the services I desire.
I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
"This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"
Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.
Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.
"Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use."
This tablet is light weight and thin which makes it ideal to hold on my hands. I love it!
I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to download all of her games and apps that she uses to have on the iPad.
"The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process."
"Bought it for my mom, it was real easy to transfer her downloads from her phone to the tablet.."
Easy to set up. East tie you. Would highly recommend this product to others
Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too
I am happy to have udated my fire! I love having the camera work the way it should. WAy to use.
I love it. It is so easy to use and great apps to.
I wanted something simple for my Mom to use and this is perfect for her.
It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product
"purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!"
"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price."
This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.
Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.
"I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use."
This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.
Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.
I brought to my 2 nices and so far they are enjoy it ....
Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!)
I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.
"Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
This tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on.
Easy access to book reader. Love watching my Netflix.Con - Slow getting on Internet.
"Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast."
"Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.
I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.
I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
"This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use
"This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version"
I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
Tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet
"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
I needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips. Bought two of these and boy do they deliver!!! The best tablets for this price. The kindle book reader is an added bonus. The finishing is good. My kids love it.
"This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!"
bought it for my son. he likes it. very good alternate to expensive tables out there.
I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.
I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.
This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!
Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase
You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good
"I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet."
We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.
Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
It's a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it's not what I was thought it's going to be I returned it back just be of this reason
"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
"convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.
I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
It's great for kids for a cheap iPad alternative however need credit card and no way to prevent accidental purchases
Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!
I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.
I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
I'm normally an Apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the Amazon Fire is.
the recipient of this tablet uses it often and loves it so much that I'm buying one for myself.
"Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome"
Was looking for something small I could use to get on the Internet and check emails and this is prefect for that
Bought as a gift but have not had any issues with products purchased from you
"I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader."
Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.
Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.
Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew for his birthday. He had been asking for a tablet forever. I made his day! He loves his tablet. All he's does is watch you tube and play games
I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it
Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do...
Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet
"Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy"
"great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
"Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life"
Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.
This item works great and fitst anywhere. I have no complaints...
Great tablet especially for the price it's not an iPad by any means but will run and play a lot of androids apps works off wifi and has a micro ad card reader
"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
"good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for"
Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
Liked the first one so much I bought one for the wife
Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
Nice device I like to use it to read books online.
Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
"I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK."
"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
"I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
"I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes."
"I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
It's a good device for children because they don't know any better
We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
My son uses the device to help him do his homework
"Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
"Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small."
"The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
Excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at Bestbuy
I bought this to read books on. Excellent for that. Difficult to navigate otherwise
"Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
"Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."
The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.
Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.
It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
"Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics"
The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.
my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.
"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook"
Bought this as a gift.. Good price and features for this Kindle
Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.
"Bought this for my son, it's been through some stuff and still going strong"
My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear
Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
Enjoy using this product. My granddaughter downloads multiplied games to play and can play them while traveling. Good size and can easily fit into small bag.
My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.
"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
"Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage."
"I am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price"
Excellent little tablet for reading books when you're on the go.
I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
"Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge."
This is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games.
This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.
"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.
"Good tablet for the price, and excellent for kids."
This tablet is perfect for my six year old's learning apps.
Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
"For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good"
This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.
Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
I got this tablet on a deal and has good quality of video you can watch.
"This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account."
"I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
"For the price you can't beat this little tablet, it does an awesome job!"
I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top
"It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine"
"Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
"We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!
"This is so awesome, I can check my email when I'm not at home, if the place I'm visiting has WIFI. It also plays games! A true multi-tasker!"
First got the fire stick so the tablet was a great addition.
Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.
Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.
"Great tool for kids, special when you don't need to $$$ to much."
I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
I love it! I'm a senior and was able to set it up and get library books without help.
I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.
"I use this all the time for playing games and reading books, it's great for surfing the web too."
IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend.
Like how I was able to buy a version with more memory. Love this works great.
"The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use."
This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun
"I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games."
This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.
Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
"I'm very pleased with my Kindle fire. I've used it more than I thought I would, as I primarily was getting it for reading, but wanted the internet access and ability to review and edit documents, too. In addition to reading more lately than I usually do, I'm also turning my Fire on instead of my desk top computer if I'm only going to use it a short time."
I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
I love this and it's great for kids got it for a early Christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it
"Love my kindle it's the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating"
My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
"I got it just for my son and he can get on and play games and watch videos no problem, the parental controls are amazing and keep him in his specific apps"
"I bought this for my 7 year old, it has endured all that a 7 year old would and could give it."
Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
"I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money."
"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price."
"I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is ""Mom, you are the best"", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!"
I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.
"I'm enjoying my amazon fire. I've been reading great books, checking my e-mail and shopping.I highly recommend this product..value great quality great.You won't be disappointed."
Bought for my children. Holds plenty of apps. Safe to use with parental controls. Pretty durable but definitely recommend buying a screensaver and case for it.
I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
My son uses his tablet on a daily basis. He makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps. I can also use it and put on parental protections.
"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
"Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy"
I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.
This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.
"My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them."
"Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
I bought this to stream HD music via bluetooth to my stereo. Works great and for the price offered can't be beat.
"Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.
"If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.
Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!
"Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound."
"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus. Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas
"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store."
My kids read books play games take pictures they love this.
Step son wanted a tablet and nowadays kids are up to date on technology so the kid friendly tablets weren't enough for him. Perfect for kids when iPads are way too expensive for a first tablet
Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol
Grandkids and adult parents love it. The parents texted and the grandkids play games.
Got it as a gift for my grandma and she loves it!!
"Excellent price for a tablet. Hit for my daughter, she loves it!"
This is a great tablet for the price! Love the pink color!
Very happy with my purchase. The tablet works amazingly good for the price.
Got this as a gift for s friend that loves to read books! Very convenient and portable. Doesn't heat up to bad either.
I love my amazon fire. This is the best product I've ever bought. I can get any books I want for way cheaper than they are on store.
Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints.
I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.
I bought this tablet for my kids to watch videos and use mostly educational games on it and they love it.
"A great Christmas gift, great for listening to music"
Bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself
Bought this tablet for my son. Great price and has great features. Camera quality is not good
easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty
"Gave it to my grandkids (ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
"Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
"I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose."
"Ive always been a kindle fan, you can play games, take pics, read books, listen to music, even go online, and the parental controls make it very easy to protect kids."
"My daughter loves it, except that she can't connect to her chromecast"
Purchased this for 6 year old boy and couldn't be happier
This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.
This tablet is a good choice for little kids. It is not very expensive and provide nice features for the price. You can beat this!!!
Got for reading Amazon books. Works great. Would recommend.
Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position.
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. Works great.
my son loves it and is easy to use and has parental controls so he can't buy stuff without permission
My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places
"Small enough to carry every where. When he is using it, you can hear a pin drop."
Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
"Easy for reading, easy to hold - can send emails, takes pictures - must be connected to WIFI to get setup."
Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with.
"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain."
"Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen"
This product is great! It is great for those that enjoy using it for reading but also for entertainment. It is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show.
I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.
links up with up local library. good to read in sunlight. can check web and emails. close to having a tablet but have to figure out what apps work with amazon.
I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them.
I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.
"It has been useful for college looking up information I don't understand and for downloading books. It is also great for downloading apps such as Facebook, messageer, yahoo, google, Google maps, and the weather. It has also been great for downloading games."
I bought this for my step mom who likes playing solitaire. She wore her hand held game out and couldn't find a replacement. She just loves it and can do a lot of other things on it.
We brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to Hawaii. Books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths. Pesky airline and their poundage issues. Now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer. It's a win win but no win for the airlines!
My kids love them. Able to do so many things with it!
Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank
"Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet."
I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.
This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!
if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore
It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
"Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,"
Bought this for a gift for some one who's old tablet won't work. Just the right size to play games on.
Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology.
"I bought two of these as a birthday gift for my niece and nephew. They absolutely love them. They use it all the time to play games and music. Great deal, great price LOVE ITL:)"

"bought this as a christmas gift for our son, it holds a lot of games and is very easy to use"
I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
Nice gift for the grandson. He will get much use of it! It was nice that it was available in different colors so that he could tell his apart from his sister's.Nice size for traveling with.
"My wife loves reading, and being able to have so many books to choose from is great. The price of the kindle is also great. If you factor in the cost of books. This was a great investment for her."
"My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price."
"Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it. The speed, ease of use and size were perfect for him. He mostly uses it for music, youtube and instagram..all of which seem to work fine on it. It was also very affordable. He's happy with it so we are too."
Purchased these for Christmas gifts. Assuming they were satisfactory because I didn't hear of need for returning. Purchased as angel tree gifts for preteens.
"This tablet was a gift for my father-in-law and is his first tablet ever. He is really enjoying getting to know his way around it. It's definitely user friendly and perfect for reading, music, and things like that!"
The images are crisp and text very easy to read. Apps are good and easy to navigate. Love it.
Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family.
easy to operate and has good color. use it when out and about.
"I bought the fire because I had heard it was a good tablet. So when I bought it, I was wondering if it lived up to the hype. It does. Its fast and easy to use. I put Netflix on it and watch series I missed. Only downside is that I had to register for a trial of prime."
"The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook."
Awesome price on Black Friday! Great tablet for reading and searching the Internet. Has expandable memory slots which is great!
Bought it as a gift for my aunt. She says that she loves it uses it everyday! Does a lot more than her old Kindle.

Using the Kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable.
"I wanted to upgrade my Kindle Fire - First Edition. This one is really nice. Graphics are superb as is the speed in loading. I don't know, yet, what else it can do as I haven't explored it thoroughly. It's like a mini lap top and has a camera that takes very clear pictures and has wireless connection to the internet."
This was my brother's first laptop and he loves it.
Easy to use. Like all of the features. Lightweight.
This is my first fire and I love it! It is perfect for taking my books on the go without having the large bulky books!
"Got this for my9 year old so he could play mine craft and other little games. Does well, durable and easy to operate."
"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.."
Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
"For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse!"
I like the way I can read many books and magazines as well as play various games on my kindle.
I purchased this for raffle prizes and they're great for the price.
Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
"Product was a Christmas gift, to replace and older Kindle Fire"
This is the second one I have Purchased. I purchased the 16 MB version for less than 50.00. As long as you understand it is an Amazon product it a darn good Tablet for the money
Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.
Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............

Product is great. Plenty storage for lots of books
"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
"The product was for my daughter, she loves it, and plays with it all of the time."
The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.
"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy."

bought kindle for my wife she uses it for everything especially reading. loves it.
This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.
I'VE had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low I knew I wanted to purchase another one. It can be used for a variety of uses.
Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
"Bought one of these two weeks before on Amazon and paid almost double for what Best Buy had these for. So, i bought another one the same day as this!"
Great functionality and quality for the price. I've bought several of these for customer giveaways and have yet to hear a complaint!
"Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too"
This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
"Purchased as a gift, the recipient is very happy and surprised with the performance, thinking of buying another one for myself."
This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.
"The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It's screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket."
Works great! Just the right size. Would recommend to family and friends.
The product is very durable and is great for children
This is my second Kindle Fire and I wouldn't be without one. Excellent little device for reading books and playing games. Use it daily to watch Netflix.
The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.
Easy to use at home or lunch at the office. The only problem I have is that you have to restart often. Great while using public transportation.
"Upgraded my kindle, easy and fast transfer from old to new"
So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.
this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck
Great tablet - good for kids and the whole family!
I bought this as a first time tablet for my mother. She has really learned to use it freely. The color and size are perfect for her. She uses it mainly to search the internet and check her emails. Great starter. I am going to download some books for her to read as she travels.
Was not hard to set up and love the quality. Good screen size and clarity.
"Not the fanciest tablet, but it definitely gets the job done! Bought as a gift for a friend that wanted an e-reader and he loves it!"
Great steelbook for a great movie. this steelbook is amazing
Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.
"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."
Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.
"Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value!"
"Decent camera, clarity on the screen, fast downloads."
Easy to use and set up. It is the best tablet for reading books or listening to audiobooks.
Faster and good quality for this kind of brand ...
"For a basic tablet, this is perfect. Good price. Does all I need it to!"

For the price this is a great tablet. Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.

I bought this as an exchange Gift for Christmas!!! My Mom fought over it and eventually won it! She Loves It!!!
"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong."
I bought this tablet to replace my textbook. It has everything I want and need. I only purchased it after I learned you can download from google play. The amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games.
I bought two of these for two of my children. The parental controls are great and I can easily control their access to content. The ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. This tablet does everything I wanted it to do.
I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!
I had a Kindle Fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. Could not be more pleased with this tablet.
I have already got 2 from Best Buy before this is my third one
"I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader."
"I have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids, in the past, however, the sales associate recommend this tablet, and it was only 10 dollars more. So far, I am really impressed by the difference in quality."
"I love my Amazon Fire tablet, I bought this all the while knowing that people had negative reviews... But honestly I don't know what they did to theirs because mines doesn't have any issues... I've had mines for over a month and still working perfectly like I just bought it yesterday..."
I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt

"I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it, so i love it."
The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
"This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore, it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet."
"I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I made a wise purchase"
It's great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it!
Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet 16GB has been easy for me to learn how to use. I like that I can read free books from the library. It has everything I wanted and is a nice size for holding.
"We have always been Nexus Tablet desciples, and in fact have bought 6-8 of them for self and family members. This one was for granddaughter to replace Nexus that had gotten slow.This one works better/faster than the Nexus! It's fast....easy to use; perfect tablet for a child or teenager...and can't beat the price!Very pleased with purchase...."
"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets."
"I bought this a few weeks ago and use it every day. i've had no problems and it works perfectly! My only complaint is the camera. The pictures are not as clear as I would prefer. All in all though, for the price, I would buy it again!"

I bought this tablet for my 10 year old grandson. He loves it! It is very easy to operate and has a great display.
My daughter has had this tablet for almost 2 months and it works well.
"I bought this Kindle because I needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 8-5 schedule. And so far, no complaints! Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."

I love my Kindle! It's perfect for reading my favorite books!

I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
"Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great."
good tablet for the price its quick and easy to use
great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen

My 6yr old son loves the tablet!I plan on purchasing another Fire tablet!
This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!
Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also
You couldn't get a better buy for $59 than the Amazon fire 7. Paid the extra $20 to get the 16gb. Well worth it.
I bought this for reading/listening books. Love the availability to expand the memory. Now I can load movies and tons of books! :-)

I have not stopped reading on this amazon fire. Love it!!
The graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected!
I Bought Two Of The Amazon Fire Tablets For My 6 & 8 Year Old And I've Had No Problems With Them. They Don't Have Some Of The Games That You Can Download On An Android Market But Other Then That The Tablets Overall Are Great Especially For Kids Sense They Have a Child's Browsing & Adult Browsing With Parental Locks.
Love this tablet have had several others but this brand works everytime..very happy with my purchase
"It has a clear screen, the books are easy to download, I like the other features as well."
"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great"
I like to watch movies on it. But it doesn't see to connect correctly to WiFi.
Good size for space I had for the TV. The color is good.
"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
"Great value, just the right size and weight. Suits my needs perfectly. Performs very well. Easy to get accessories to fit."
I purchased this for my husband as a replacement for his old one. He is very hay with it.
The Fire Tablets are by far the best value on the market. They are parent friendly with the parental controls and kid friendly with he ease of use.
This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.
This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.
"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
"Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly!"
I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it!
My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work.
My son LOVES it! Easy to use and download books. Requested for his Birthday gift.

light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images
This tablet operates wonderfully. The size is handy. The graphics vibrant.For the affordable price it is unbeatable :-)
I bought this for my niece. She uses this for E-books. Better than having to store tons of books in her case.
"Good reader, nice small tablet, charging cord is to short."
"I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product."
Nice size and color. It was easy to grip. very pleased
Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it
So I was given a HD for Christmas and when this went on sale in time for Father's Day I had to get it... Love that it has the expansion slot!!!
I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.
The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much
"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.
"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
"I so love my Amazon fire tabletYou have.everything you want books, games etc. The picture are so clear and beautiful. I can't keep my son off of it . I'm thinking about getting another for him .He love watching videos of his favorite show"
I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here
The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.
This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.
It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.
"Thrilled with the ease of use, so easy to navigate! I wish I had started with a tablet like this, it would have saved me a lot of frustration."
I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!
Slower that my iPad. Love it. Cheaper and better than my Kindle Paperwhite with much more storage. Also bought 128 micro SD card. Prime member and use it to download free with prime movies
I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
Bought it for my 8 yr old for Christmas and he loved it. I like that some of the apps that come with it can be deleted making more room for apps you would want to add.
I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
"It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it."
Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.
"I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner"
My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!
I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
"Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words."
I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on."
For a cheap starter tablet it's fine. Bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that.
I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation
"I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account."
Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games
We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.
My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy
I got this to replace my Samsung tablet. I read alot and so i figured that the kindle would be ok to use. I have found that it works great with the books that I read and I really like the Blue Light feature making it easier to fall asleep reading.
It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it
Love this tablet! This is my second. Just couldn't beat the price!!
"The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!"
I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
"Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable
"I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome ."
Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
"Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!"
"Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen."
"I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet!"
I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor.
We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
Any Kindle product I have purchased is easy to use
This product does what it say it do. I really enjoy reading
I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.
It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
"Love this product, and don't know why it took so l"
Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me.
was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
"The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection."
So far my Fire is working well. I did have difficulty setting it up initially and had to ask a Best Buy tech to help me out. Connecting with my wireless was the most difficult step. The print is easy to read and can be enlarged. It is nice to be able to access e-mail. I find that it is easier to use if placed in a book-style protective case. That makes it easier to hold while reading. Anyone should enjoy using the Fire!
Great device. Travels well. Easy to navigate. Would recommend.
I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great
"I have had 4 kindles over the years , got to have one to read my books & relax"
I love my tablet. It is easy to use and it was ready to go when I turned it on.
It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time
Love it will recommend it to my friends.Found it to be as good as having a I pad.You can take good photos and face time as well as text.A vary llite tablet that comes in a number of colors.You can also use it out doors because it has a polarizing filter.
Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now!
my dauther loves the tablet and I can get the SD to get more storage and load up all the disney movies that I purchased. it is a great purchase.
Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use
So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.
The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family.
Wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse. Very easy to use. Would buy again.
We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use
"Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy."
Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.
"battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint."
fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.
"I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone ."
This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to.
"I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them."
"I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my ""library"" that's not taking up space on my phone."
My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows
"I debated on what tablet/reader to buy and decided on the fire! I have been very pleased with it. Bought it on sale, what a great price!"
bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!
Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas
Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.
Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.
Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
"Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect."
Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.
I bought two of these for my 82 year old mother and 88 year old aunt - they love them! Easy to use! Great gift. Can't wait to buy one for me!
I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased.
Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.
"I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!!"
"I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it."
"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store."
This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements.
"Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read."
Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.
My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.
was a great purchase. loved the color and the camera feature
I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.
My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.
Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
I bought Geek Squad for 2 years. Well after 13 months my device became broken. So the warranty came in handy. Thank you knowing things happend in life.
"This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!"
best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
"I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them."
"This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point."
I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.
"I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.
"Bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. He loves it. Couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."
Perfect device for gaming apps and on-the-go streaming!
Great tablet. Perfect for my 8 year old son!!!!!!!!!!!
My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
"She loves it, she has one of the first Kindles and uses it daily, so this new one was a surprise and she enjoys the color in some of the cookbooks. The clarity and the Washington Post was an added feature, and fact that it was so easy to use."
This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.
This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
"Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!"
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.
"This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable"
Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
"I bought this for my wife, basically just for reading books. She has come to love it. She is constantly reading. Lighting wasn't an issue or I would have gotten the reader.When she isn't reading, I borrow it for puzzle type games, and it is great. Not a iPad by any stretch but it is more convenient than the mini that she also owns. Prior to the Amazon Fire she was reading on the iPhone 6+.a"
"A friend loves hers & told me I would love it, I do"
Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
"This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere."
My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
I love my new Panasonic phone system. It has 2 handsets which is a good idea for those living with family! I also like the ease of operating the answering machine as well. Thank you Best Buy!
"We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
"Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced"
Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy.
nice to have to watch netflexs on in bed and relax.
My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.
loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect
I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done
"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better"
Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again
Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
"When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet."
Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."
"good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing."
Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
"Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok"
"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available"
Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.

"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store."
Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
I love this tablet. It's the perfect size for my kid. Keeps him entertained during long trips. We picked up the free time kid proof case and it's perfect also.
It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
"Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!"
Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
"Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
"This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
"I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs."
Perfect for my granddaughter birthday. She loves to read. So many books
"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."
Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...
My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
"I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it."
"Purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. Perfect size. The front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added FB, sharing photos was easy. Amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of Kindle books. There are Amazon ads on the Kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device."
A great tablet for the price--really no major complaints!
Does everything I need and has a long battery life.
"This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy."
"PERFECT SIZE FOR TRAVELING, COMPACT AND LIGHT, AMAZON APPS ARE INCLUDED, GREAT FOR STREAMING VIDEOS AND SHOWS ON THE GO!!!!"
I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.
"Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase."
"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !
The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price.
"Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
"So far, so good. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn't anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable."
Good product and the quality of the product is good. Easy to use.
I personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun
"I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
This is my son's 4th kindle. It is reliable but the charging plug area wears out quickly
"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially.
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
For 7 year old. Now has two in different colors - can tell what is on which one by color.
"I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!"
"This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker."
Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
"Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device."
"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
"Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!"
My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
"We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need."
I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues
"I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!"
Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.
Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
"Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable"
Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
Had a kids fire and switched to this with a kids case and tempered glass this time works really well for kids
I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
"Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven't put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!!"
"This is a first for an adult. Price is right, easy to use and just the right size."
I gave it away. It was too nice for me. The person I gave it to was gleeful.
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
"I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
"Great to view movies, play games, surf the net. Makes shopping on Amazon music easy"
The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.
"Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one."
This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.
"So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books."
This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.
Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
"It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate"
Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!
"The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy."
"I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music."
Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.
I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.
Upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was 4 years old. So worth it.
My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.
I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
"The best product name on the market,no doubt about it."
I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
"Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games."
It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.
is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks
Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
"Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent."
Gift was on point. Recipient was very pleased. Would recommend to others.
"There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app."
"I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
"I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.
Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product
This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device
Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.
Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
"I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!"
"I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it"
I love the touch screen aspect still love the original.
"(accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one."
My second one and works better than the first one.
"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
"Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great."
"This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet."
"Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!"
Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.
Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.
The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
"I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on."
"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers
"I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn't think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn't need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too!"
Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.
"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading"
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"
Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable
Love my new kindle!!! I would recommend this to anyone who reads ebooks or has audible.
"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!"
I got this as gift for my husband and he loves it! Excellent e-reader!
"I owned the Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Paperwhite, and purchased new generation Kindle Oasis recently. It feels much more premium with the aluminium casing than first generation. It is so great!"
"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read."
This is the best Kindle out of a long line of Kindles. Amazon improved on all the bad points of the first Oasis and made it almost perfect.
I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
"Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly."
IMO they have perfected the display. even lighting. no glare. and now it's waterproof??? incredible.
"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.
"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have."
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
"I'm a huge fan of the e-readers. I find I read more on my kindle than any other device (iPad, other tablet). I recently upgraded from the Kindle Paperwhite to the Oasis. I'm a huge fan of the larger screen and ergonomic feel. It has been a pleasure to use."
"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough."
"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)"
"This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it."
"Really comfortable to hold, 7-inch screen looks fantastic and offers some features that could be useful. If you use audible or like to read near water (poolside or in a bath) then this would be the e-reader to go with. If not, then I would just stick with the Voyage (if you're a hardcore reader) or a Paperwhite for casual readers."
"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels"
"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience."
"I was used to the Kindle 3rd gen(Kindle Keyboard) and when i first held the Oasis it felt very odd and uncomfortable and the metal back made it feel like it could slip and fall at any second. It does take time to get used to. The device is expensive for something that is not even a colored screen. However, my main reason was because it was a bigger screen and clearer ( besides there doesn't seem to be much upgrades between the Kindle Keyboard and the other ones) I find myself accidently touching the touchscreen more often than I would like ( but much less than when I 1st got it- a week or so ago). All in all it is a sleek and nice device, alittle pricey."
"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is."
"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
The design is good. Love to read books with this beautiful device. The battery is not very good though.
Great oven with a nice even heat with the convection part
Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.
lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle
"This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier . I couldn't believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere ."
This e reader is great because of higher pixel dpi - no blemish to detract from reading. My only grip is it‚Äôs kind of a finger print magnet slash sweaty but it‚Äôs my first e-reader so maybe that‚Äôs to be expected and I don‚Äôt use a case.Try reading in landscape mode it‚Äôs so comfy and feels like less natural reading eye fatigue somehow.
"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs."
Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.
Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking
"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all."
The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it.
"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.
"Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader."
Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.
"This Kindle is light weight, easy to read and water proof. A great buy."
Bought this IPAD for my daughter and husband for Christmas. They love it and great for capturing the kids moments.
This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update
I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book
Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader.
I love this so far only downside is you can not read and listen at the same time. Its one or the other. Battery life is poor. 50% drained on stanby in under a week. Lasts better if you keep wifi bluetooth off
"I adore this kindle. I have owned voyage and paperwhite previously. And all the three; paperwhite, voyage and oasis 2017 are fantastic devices but the only two reasons i upgraded are bigger screen and waterproof. Though the screen size is little bigger than the previous models it does make quite a difference. Also oasis comes with 8gb or 32gb of memory. But otherwise i love paperwhite and voyage as well."
"Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it."
"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis."
"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues."
"I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device!"
Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage.
Really impressed with the effects of the cover. Works great with the kindle. Highly recommend this.
"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear.

I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down.

Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.

"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!"
"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go."
"Love bigger screen, bold fonts, auto rotate & ability to hold it with one hand. Hate slippery aluminum backside. Where did the grippy textured surface go? So easy to drop."
I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.
"I have used and loved three previous Kindles: the Kindle Keyboard, the 1st gen Paperwhite and the Voyage. Without a doubt this one is the best. This is the first Kindle I can comfortably hold in my hands. I love that if I want to switch from holding it in left hand to holding it in right hand, the text automatically flips. No matter which hand you hold it in the page turn buttons are in the perfect place for your thumb. No regrets in this purchase!"
"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far."
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against."
"Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter!"
"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!"
"I've always been a fan of the Kindle, ever since the first one came out over a decade again.I was excited about this Kindle due to the many premium features it showed - the all-metal finish, high-resolution ePaper display, backlighting, extended battery life, etc.I was significantly disappointed to see that Amazon pushes ads through the Kindle when you put it into sleep mode, and throughout the store options. Additionally, I was further frustrated by the fact that I learned there was a cellular version (available direct from Amazon) but not through the store. For such an expensive unit, to have ads with no option to disable them, seems unreasonable and like a rip-off. Additionally, the fact that this only supports wifi (not cellular or WhisperSync) makes it even more of a drawback and something I would not recommend to a friend - stick with the cheaper version.I also found annoying problems trying to get my Apple Airpod earphones to work with this device. Pairing took forever to finish or work (had to try three different times) and if the unit sits for too long, I found that I had to go through the entire pairing process again; they were not automatically connected and synced the moment I had both devices turned on."
Bought this as a birthday present and my wife loved the upgrade from her Paperwhite. Easier to hold and lighter. She has commented the screen is also much easier to read.
Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.
This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday
Kind of disappointed that they did away with the included battery cover and also removed the ability to even connect a battery cover.
"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.
This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading -
"Best reader, super light a very fast reader but pricy."
great tablet for kids when traveling. my grandchild loves it.
"Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all."
"Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter."
My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever.
"My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these ""kids"" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell."
"This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
"Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,"
My son is 4 and he loves it. Super easy to use for kids.
A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. Great deal on a great product.
My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.
the tablet is just the right size for our granddaughter. she loves it. she can play her little games and has so much fun with it.
This is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.
We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.
"I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."
My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.
The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her."
My daughter loves this. There are so many settings and you don't have to buy every app individual. So many books and educational apps :)
My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it
"This tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end."
This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend
"I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked."
This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.
My granddaughter loves this tablet. She is two and has no problem playing the games and using this tablet. It's very user friendly and keeps her busy for hours.
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips
Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily
Love the color pink for granddaughter she loves carrying around her own tablet. Wonderful product. love the safety protective case great unit.
Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.
this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover
"We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this"
"Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend."
"I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend."
Purchased for my niece and she loves it. I like the fact I can set limits on her tablet and restrict her access until she has read. Only downside is the case doesn't have a kickstand so that the tablet can be placed upright for viewing videos/movies. But a new case can be purchased.
The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke
"Excellent product. My grandson loves it. Fast, easy to use and yet challenging enough that he is learning at the same time"
"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80"
"I didn't know how well he would do with a full blown tablet, but I am shocked at how well he navigates it ON HIS OWN. He does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. His letter understanding (he's 3.5) has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. Plus, it's a great motivation tool. I love it, and he does, too."
"Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it"
Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!
Great Christmas gift for my son. Best tablet ever.
"Great for kids, bought both colors for two of my kids."
"Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well!"
"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning
Great tablet with good parental controls for kids!!
Have had other products similar for the kids but this is the best by far. Best Buy had a great price too so decided to try it. Love it.
My 4 year old loves it. I love that she can use it unsupervised without worry. She has been learning her alphabet and this has been a great tool.
My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!
My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.
My little 8 year old guy loves this kindle. Couldn't imagine a better Christmas gift.
My son is a huge fan of it and I love that I can control what he watches and plays
This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.
This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it
"I bought the first kindle years ago for my sister. When my oldest turned 1, he wouldn't leave her kindle alone. We decided to buy him one & he has had it ever since. The learning apps such as the counting ones, ones about learning shapes, and learning his ABCs, assists in his advancement in his schooling. We all have a kindle in the house, to include my 3 year old (this is his first year with one). Love it!"
"This is the perfect tablet for a toddler. I feel like there is stuff for him to now, but he can also grow with it. And it's built like a tank."
"My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!"
Very awesome tablet for kids and great parental controls
Bought it for my granddaughter. She is so smart. She can get on and find her apps. She lives the videos and games.
I bought this as a gift for my grandkids. They absolutely love it!
I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!!
Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
"Bought as Christmas gift. He loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
"Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
This is an excellent tool to help our granddaughter advance her learning skills and also allows her an opportunity to play educational games
"I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that's all that matters."
My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down!
"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi."
This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
"I especially loved the bumper that protects it! He absolutely loved this gift! It has parental control. It has the ability to buy games that are educational for him; and we are all thrilled with it....myself, his parents and our little guy!!!!"
Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!
I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.
This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops.
This is a great tablet. My grandson uses it to watch his cartoons. We also have ABC Mouse that he uses on it. It's very durable and he loves it!!
Love the amount of time we can set that she can be on this! The bumper guard has been handy. Apps that were on it are awesome. Best of all she loves it!
"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone."
"Love this tablet, great value, come with great protective case, preloaded apps are an awesome feature. The included 2 year protection is also a plus."
My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...
Arrived yesterday as promised! Little one loves it
Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.
My 3 yr old loves her new tablet and my wife and I are glad to get ours back. Very simple usage. Has all of her favorite apps on it.
My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She
This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
"I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work."
It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids
My son loves his tablet. It is very easy to use. Very stutdy.
"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
"Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services."
Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.
"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it
"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
This is the best child's tablet and some adults like me can benefit from the warranty and matched case
Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we!
"Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!"
"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.
I bought this for my grandson and it hasn't disappointed me at all! He loves his tablet! I am looking at buying his sister one next!
"purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it."
This is one of the best tabs for kids to start with.Rugged and sophisticated.
This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
"My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome"
Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
I bought this and onother one in blue. The kids love it.
The best tablet for kids the 1 year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it..
This is the second one I bought. My older son wouldn't share his so for Christmas santa brought little brother one lol. The apps that come with the subscription are endless. I also have Netflix and both kids watch different shows on it too. I once bought a sprout cubby tablet and it broke within 2 days and the customer service was terrible they would not replace and actually wanted to charge more than I paid. The customer service with amazon however is fantastic and replaced my sons tablet when it cracked within 3 days!! They are durable but my older toddler is Just a crazy lil man. You won't regret buying this for your kids.
Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.
Son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. Nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. No questions asked.
Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.
"I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!"
"Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use."
my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.
Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
I got this because it is almost impossible to break
Bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn't broken it either.
I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
It would have been nice if the charging cord was more compatible with other devices.
The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
"Great gift, for my kid's second birthday! This product is very child friendly and easy to use! I recommend this product for families!"
My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
This is the way to go for an all-in-one package for the kids. Everything is set-up and easily controlled through adult log in...
"This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy."
"This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it."
"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.
Great price for product. It's get of you have kids.
"nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate"
"My daughter is learning so much from the games on this device, my wife was glad I bought it."
"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained
I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
"I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
"Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good."
returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
"Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it"
"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
"Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!"
My Mistake to buy for 1yr old.But my 30yr old son enjoys it!
There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
Great to give to the little ones so they don't break my phone. Found it at a great price and used rewards to bring the price down more.
Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
This is my 2yr. olds and he loves it. He loves the different games and watching reviews.
This is very durable for a young child. It is very easy to use even for my 2 yo granddaughter.
I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.
This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it .
We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.
Bought for grand daughter for Xmas since most 5 year olds now a lot about tablets and had no problem with this very easy to use.
Best tablet for my 2 year old son... it has helped a lot and seems to be the most simple kids tablet system available
I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!
BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.
granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.
"I bought this for several reasons, the 2 year warranty, ease of use. My granddaughter is 21 months old and she has figured it out. Very durable, she drops it and it keeps on working"
My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.
This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
"This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase."
Easy and age appropriate. Can set timers for tv and movie watching my granddaughter finds the educational games more interesting and fun.
Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. She is able to easily use it with minimum assistance.
Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life.
"Easy to use. Great for kids. Great for mom when kids steal mom's phone. Lightweight. Great protective case. But it gets really dirty, real quick."
Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.
This was purchased for my grandson. It has been easy for him to use. Love the parental controls and free time mode. The included bumper case is a bonus.
"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection."
"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."
I purchased this tablet for a 6 yr old and it is very easy for him to use.
Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift.
Bought this as a replacement for my child's iPad. Took her a little while to learn the new OS but once she got the hang of it it was pretty easy. Lots of content and excellent at the price point.
Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.
My son loves it. Easy set up. And the best part is the case. It really is childproof. My son has dropped it and nothing had happened. Very durable. Just what my son needed.
This tablet is very kid friendly. You log on the tablet and the kids is having fun...
"not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged (me) I find it easy to work with"
I observe my 4 year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease. She is able to play some of the games and upload movies. Her mom had to put a secret password for the movies because she downloaded some that you had to pay for!
Purchased as a birthday gift for grandson and he LOVES it.
The tablet offered my son hours and hours of continuous learning and excitement he would not put it down until it went dead and the batteries had to be recharged
She loves it. She is 20 months old and already has command of it. Micky and Minnie rule it!
"The idea is great, a kindle just for kids. Design just for them with pre-approved content.The price was great. I got it for $79.99 on black friday. Plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. They break it, we fix it. Is that simple.Content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.User Interface, not the best one. Amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content."
"Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he's 4, he loves it."
Excellent Amazon fire HD for kids. Perfect for a holiday gift
excellent for kids and safe cover so if dropped it survives
For the price this is a great investment. With amazon prime it becomes loads of fun
I purchased this item for my 3 year old son. It's very durable because he drops it a lot on purpose but most importantly it has a ton of educational activities for him.
My sons love playing on their tablet. Not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided.
This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five.
"Not only is it an excellent first tablet for a child, but it is a kindle. They can grow into it as well. And from studying up on the product before hand, I was able to determine that they have excellent customer service! That is a big plus!"
This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set
"offers a lot for the price, good parental controls"
"Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver."
Definitely a good learning tool for children. Easy
"My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
"Got 2 of these for my two oldest daughters, 5 and 3. Perfect for them and love the features. Battery life seems pretty long. The year of freetime plus the case makes it worth it! Will be getting another for my 3rd daughter's 2nd birthday."
This is a great tablet for children and really has an easy to use format. The apps work well and keep the kid entertained by not distracting them with the mechanics.
My daughter absolutely loves this! It is very user friendly. My only issue with it would be that it doesn't come with a camera automatically installed.
Excellent gift for my grandkids. They love it and play with it all the time.
Proved to be an excellent Christmas gift for both grandkids. They love it
"Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit"
"I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also."
My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer
My Grandson uses it all the time. It was a great choice!
"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip."
My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present
My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.
"This is an excellent product for kids. There are lots of games, books (including interactive ones) and cartoons. I also like you can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. The only downfall is the charger cable sucks."
"My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
Bought this for my six year old grandson. The set up was very easy. He is able to download kids only stuff and can send us videos of himself using the app. He just loves it. Truly kid friendly.
The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.
My son loves this tablet. It is easy for him to navigate and extremely durable.
I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.
Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!
Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full
My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.
Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.
My kid loves it and is easy to use.Plus the case is worth it.
I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.
I am very happy with this purchase. Keeps my grandsons entertained. Easy to set up and use.
bought for my grand baby for christmas....haven't opened it yet but the other reviews were great!.....i'' sure he'll love it!!....
The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
Our 5 year old grandson loved it. Bought it for him to play educational games on.
This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.
"My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."
This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
"The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far."
It's good for toddlers. Would recommend to another parent.
Easy to use grandson enjoys it .plus the two year warranty you can't beat kids can be rough on tablets.
"Great for a 2 yr old, and will use it till he's older"
"I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!"
I did some looking in the web and after looking at many tablets this was the best choice.
Did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value.
She loves to be on the tablet all the time . So now she will have her own.
My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained
It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone !
I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
"The best device for a child in the market. Purchased for an infant and after two weeks, he is loving it. Easy to handle and durable."
It ended up being the most popular gift that she got it does a wonderful job for children
Was a gift for 7 yr old granddaughter she just loved it one of her favorite item she plays with. It goes with her almost everywhere
"Protective, fast and has tons of fun games already on it! Our 7 year old daughter likes it, too!"
"The kids tablet made a good gift for our youngest grandson, 6 years of age."
I bought this as a gift for my smart 1 yr old niece and she loves it. she is always using the tablet. it's her favorite toy.
"Best gift ever, now she leaves mom and dads phones/tablets alone and plays his own, which is also locked down as well. And thanks to the low price, I bought for his siblings as well, there is peace now"
I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
Bought this tablet for my 2 &1/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.
Have fun with it .Good game Good apps . Easy to used
"I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this"
i would not change any thing on it at all it works very good
It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product..
It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab
love it great for kids my son loves it and wont put it down
It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.
My 5 year old grandson really enjoys his new tablet. He's had it for several months. The only negative I see is the charge port is starting to get loose. The small plug is maybe not robust enough for a 5 year old.
Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.
"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
I bought it for my 2 (almost 3) year old. He really lover it. I love that I can put a timer on it and he can't be on it all day. It's easy to use. The only thing I hate is how fast the battery runs down even if not in use.
Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature
Excellent quality and durability for a young child
"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Installed a 64 gb micro SD and install as many apps to the card as possible to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 5 year old granddaughter."
My little girl loves this tablet. It keeps her engaged and entertained. It comes with a protective case that protects it from falls and the handlings' of kids. You can download apps and with parental control you are protected from your kids accidentally making unnecessary purchases without your knowledge. Great tablet for kids!
It's a good tablet for a young kid. A little hard to navigate even for adults. Cant figure out how to navigate the internet!
This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.
I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire
This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.
"Good for convenience when other devices are tied up, but the keyboard lags a little slower than I would like."
This is a kid friendly tablet good for gaming and learning games as well. Glad we got it.
Setup was extremely easy. Easy for grandchild to use. Only difficulty is with parental controls stopping connection with library.
He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics
Overall very good product for kid. Much robust and easy to operate.Only downside is that it is sometimes very slow.
Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it was a good buyShock proof and great educational apps for kids in it
Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that
Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
"my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.
"This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it
I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded
"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.
My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one.
My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho
"Pretty good tablet. Very durable and my son loves it, keeps him busy lots of game to choose from educational as well"
I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems
"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."
"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken."
Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.
Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better
It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
"We had given hand-me down iPhones to the kids to use for car trips and the like a while back and were looking to update them. For the price, this is the best deal. You have access to a lot of the same apps (although you might have to start them over). It has a durable case. And is a good size for little hands. It is very helpful to be able to time activities so they don't have a choice about handing it back over. Only downside is one of our cords doesn't charge as well as we'd like and sometimes it seems a little slow starting certain apps in comparison to our apple products. But if you don't want to pay the apple price, this is the way to go. Kids will definitely be entertained by it!"
"My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!"
Good for toddlersEasy to carryEasy to download
Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast
A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
My son just loves it and he thinks it's easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it
For two girls that love to play games and take with them
Bought for my kid - 5 year old Kid. Worth a buy. Recommended.
I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.
Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.
Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.
This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier
But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.
Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
"Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps."
It's a good tablet for kids the only thing I really don't like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok
"Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with."
My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side.
This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps
Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well.
A great watch. I bought it for the heart rate feature and it is pretty accurate.
Bought for my son for Christmas and so far he loves it good value for the price.
My daughter loves the device. Only had it a few days
Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
I enjoy the product. It was easy to program. My toddler pushed a button that changed the setting. I took the product to the store and the kind salesman corrected the product.
My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal.
Bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. Wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase.
I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps
"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it"
My daughter loves it and so does my son and wife too.
So read reviews on a few tablets but honeatly felt this was the one for my kids bought it and sure enough it was it best apps for kids especially reading for kids amazon did a good deal on this and if you have prime it links up with your account for videos too
"Good tablet fir children 3 and up , especially when you go on a vacation, long plane or train ride ."
I definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children.
It's a great tablet for a destructive 10 year old. It's still going strong for 2 months now
My grandkids love's it always on it great learning tool
This is a great little kids tablet. Has a lot of features and is really fun to use.
This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!
My children love it. Los of different things they can do to learn
"Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet."
"This tablet has served it's purpose, it keeps my little one entertained with age appropriate sites and apps."
My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It's friendly and easy to use.
Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.
"Good tablet for kids, only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire"
Good tablet for kids. Easy to use and kid friendly
"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books."
"My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints."
"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!"
My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!
Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.
This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.
Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..
My kids have really enjoyed this tablet. This makes car rides a lot easier. They both can create and learn and they love the camera.
"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."
I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!
"Bought this for my 4 years old granddaughter and she loves it. It has all the books, apps, videos that she needs to learn and play. I love it cause she plays on it and leaves mine alone ‚ò∫. It has everything on it and I can set parental guides. Best buy ever! !"
This was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it.
Great learning tool for the grand kids. Helps with there homework.
Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.
"Got this for my grand niece, she loves it. Can't beat it for the price."
Grandbaby won't put it down loves itShe's dropped it too many times & the blue cover has protected her tablet every time.
I purchased two for my grandchildren. They carry the Kindle with them everywhere they go. Great purchase!
Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience !
Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter! She was wearing my Kindle out with ABCmouse.com! She loves it and I love the warranty
granddaughter loves it! Now my Ipad if free for ME to use
"good product for youngsters, provides learning and fun together"
They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom!
Purchased for the grandkids to use while they are visiting. They never seem to get bored.Tip. Make sure you have it password protected or you may find a rapid run up in charges!
Great tablet for young children. Parental locks so you can control what they see. A great deal of educational apps.
"The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe."
We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. They are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. The 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. The one con is that you don't get google play store.
"I PURCHASED TWO FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE AND THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEM, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY! I NEED TO BUY HEAD PHONES NEXT!"
My grandkids plays with this tablet all the time.lots of videos and games
BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS AGES 5-10 AND THEY LOVED IT
I love the the Kindles!! Bought this for my grandson. Impressed with the 2 years no questions asked warranty.
I love the fact that it can take a lick and keeping on ticking my grandson is a bit rough on things.
Bought for my 2 yr old grandson.. and he loves it has a lot of learning numbers alphabet and shapes
"This is the fourth one of these that I have purchased. My grand children love them. Between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, I don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. Excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at."
Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids
"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,"
I love the learning games that he doesn't even realize they are learning games
My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.
Easy to play and very helpful to learning for children's
Absolute best for kids. Bought three for ages toddler to teen and it's perfect for each.
Got this the another day for my niece and she loves everything it has to offer
"Great for the grandkids, they know how to manage them better than I do."
Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access.
"Great for the kids, and has a good battery for how much they use it"
Great price great product would recommend this gift
great table for kids and parents control great gre
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great.I love it..Im glad I got it..My nephew loves it.
Haven't had any issues until recently my son's tablet won't charge anymore. Called geek support but they couldn't locate warranty so I'll have to go in
"he loved it was a great gift easy to use, small and great"
I bought these tablets for my niece and nephew who are only 2 and 3 and they love it. My niece who's only 3 has shown my mother a few things. Great products
I can listen to music during my bath. Also there are 39 games I can play and 40 I can't play yet. I am six.
I got this for my three year old for Christmas and she loves it!
"My 3 yr old has already figured it all out. User friendly and durable with the case. Lots of free content, keeps them busy when need be."
My daughters love it it is probably one of the best tablets ive ever bought
My granddaughter loves it. She plays with all the time
My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.
"My son is crazy about it,nice size,good grafics,and Internet conection!"
My son loves it. It is easy for him to use. He doesn't want to put it down.
My son loves it. The picture and quality is great and my so loves all the apps from the characters he loves
Omg this product is excelent good batery and HD screen love this
"Purchased for my grandson, he loves it. Purchased a blue cover for him"
"She loves it, plays with it everyday all day. Thanks"
"This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps"
This is the second kindle my daughter has been using and its been good.
Very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it
We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.
"Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too"
interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.
A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids
Price was just right.i would recommend to someone.
"Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features."
Purchased these for our grandchildren ... great for children learning to use electronics.
My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I'd highly recommend this product
This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.
"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"
The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
"Bought this for my 3 kids aged 9,7,and 2. They all use it with ease. They each have their own account with appropriate games. We like the protective cover that absorbs drops and falls well."
Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.
"Great tablets, prefer over the Nabi anyday. Love the color choices"
"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I love that it has so much memory space, so I can download tons of games and activities to keep him occupied on long rides. I love the 2 year warranty and safety case. He loves it!"
"My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music."
"This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly."
Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. Great buy for the price. He loves his new tablet.
My daughter love it she don't really brother me it keep her so busy
This tablet is very easy to use i bought it for my nephew and he's only 4 years old and he love it
Great camera for a beginner very easy to understand
My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
My daughter has enjoyed it very much!!!! She loves using the camera. And playing the games she just loves it. We have to put it on charge and she is asking 5 minutes later is it charged yet!!!! Really is kid friendly
my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps.
"We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!"
My 3yr old just loves it keeps her occupied for hours
Bought for my 3 year old. Very rugged and easy to use. Love it uses the android apps and kiddo loves it.
I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks
"My children loved it, and it is great learning tool."
"I love it for my kids, they r enjoying playing games and watching kids cartoon."
"I love it so and so my kids.They r enjoying playing the educational games, and watching cartoons."
"Setting up the device for my sons profile took a litthe more time than I expected, but I love it. It's easy to navigate and has a ton of preloaded activities for him."
"Bought 3 for my young grandkids exceptional security for kids, great babysitter as well as educational tool"
"I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase."
This device provides necessary app and is extremely user friendly.
"We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. The kids love it and it is simple to use. The ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. We can switch to our profile to watch Netflix or use other apps if we want. Comes with a great warranty and device protector. We're very happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet."
Really great item for the kids and very user friendly
My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy
"We purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play games and read books without having to use her mom's devices. She took to it immediately. It connects easily to a 2.4 ghz network but does not support connectivity to a 5; search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it was the Fire or the network, then again, it was running updates. The camera takes great pictures even if a child is a bit shakey... Sound quality is very good as is touch sensitivity."
"My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his"
"Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks"
My granddaughter LOVES it! LOTS of kid-friendly apps for a 5 year old!
Everything he needs but nothing more. The case looked a little flimsy but it has been great so far.
Easy for 3 year old to navigate. Like the adult to kid use.
"Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day."
"This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time."
"Santa brought this to our daughter, she's 7 and it's perfect for her!! Easy to use and figure out!"
"I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that."
"Great tablet for a little kid. I was debating between this and an ipad but figured an ipad would be way too much for a tablet. Its nice because you can switch users. If you want something simple , then this is the one for you."
"I got this for ky 3 year old and she loves it. She has dropped it a fews times, once outside and it just bounced. I also love that I can set restrictions on play time, I can have it where this is no play time until a certain number of minutes of reading time has been completed. I don't have set times of the day that she can even get on it"
"Very easy for my child to navigate. It was very easy to set it up. All the games, books and internet that's pre-loaded is awesome and so convenient"
"Love the parental controls and more storage than previous models, but still seems to run out."
My eight year old loves the games and it is safe for her to use.
Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
Perfect for price and purpose. I bought this for my 19 month old granddaughter to watch videos and listen to songs on instead of using parents iPhone. When she is older she will be able to play games. Perfect size for her to hold. Love guarantee
we brought this tablet for our 6 yr old for Xmas and she loves it!. it was the go to tablet as she was always playing on my fire tablet... recommend for kids
Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.
"Easy to use, handle and screen is perfect for a toddler."
Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
Very durable and easy to use. Last for several years with all that it can do.
"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year."
"Thought this would be too advanced for my 3 year old, but she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and learn patience. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept her honest."
"Thought this would be too bland for an 8 year old, but he loves it. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept him honest."
"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year."
This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!
My 5 year old loves it! She can order books and look at all her favorite shows
Extremely satisfied with the value and performance of the Fire kids edition; highly recommend for age 5 and up.
"Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs"
I bought this for my daughter. I like that there are security features. She enjoys it and I have peace of mind!!
My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money
This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.
I have purchased 3 of these tables still have them just handed them down one grandchild to the next will need another next year. They are tough the heavy rubber case really keeps them safe. Good product!
It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!
As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.
We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 6 year old. He loves it. It's durable and reliable.
My son and i use the tablet everyday 2 times morning and night and theres so much to do on it.
my grand daughter and grand son love to play games on their kindles plus their mother put programs on there so they can learn
I really like that my child is engaged with all of the different apps we have downloaded.
Amazon free time great for small kids to get entertained
Awesome tablet for kids pre loaded with a ton of things and the case is even better

Bought for my son for Easter. He loves it and easy for him to use. great for different apps for learning.
Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.
Bought this for my 2 year old since he broke his portable DVD player. The only think I don't like is i had to sneakily download the google App Store so I could install vudu on it.
"Bought this for my 5 year old girl. She immediately fell in love with it. And the fact that it has a year damage warranty, it was a no brainer"
Bought this for my daughter to keep her busy in the car and flights. Works great. Good content.
Easy for my kid to use and navigate through. Fun for adults too.
Easy setup...bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5...they love it
Easy to use and great parental controls to limit or access content.
"Excellent for kids! Tons of fun apps, videos and books. Love that it comes with a year of Free Time."
Gave to my great nephew. 2.5 yrs old. He loves it and his father no longer has to turn over his phone to his son.
Got it for our grandson for Christmas and he won't put it down. Comes with free kids software which is great.
"Got this for my son, he loves it and is easy to use and add stuff for kids, the warranty is an added bonus. Plus pretty durable, since having a 2 year old, when he throws fits, this gets thrown as well."
grandson really enjoyed it Christmas. very easy to use
Great for kids. Lots of games and books for kids..
great tablet for kids with amazon bonuses. don't have to worry about what content my kid is accessing.
"Great tablet for kids. The free replacement policy is great as well. Does take a bit of effort to set up, but pretty easy for the kids to use."
Great tablet for my 3 year old son. I am able to monitor his screen time and assure that he is only playing kid friendly and educational games.
Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.
"Has so many games for the kids to choose from, I love that I can make different profiles for each kid to limit what they play"
I bought this for my 13 year old niece who has autism and she loves it. Great price and great tablet for kids.
"I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. In the end it's a great deal."
I bought this for my Don's second birthday and he loves it. My five yr old loves it also. Very easy to use.
I chose this product from my daughter's this is a great product keeps them from fighting and misbehaving. I think everyone should have one for their child this is a great product to help them learn and really affordable the people at Best Buy were really helpful.

I got this for my daughter's for Christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again Best Buy.
"I got this for my kids and I am able to have parental control over all of them, put a time limit on play time, they each have their own apps, games and books that are appropriate for their age. My kids love it and they are learning! With this kids edition I get 1 free year of all kids appropriate app,games,videos and books!"
I have bought 2 of these for my grandchildren. They live them!!
I have no issues with product. Daughter seems to love it
I love this Fire for kids. It even comes with the bumper cover. Great buy.
I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.
Is great for beginners I love the parental control on it it works great for my toddler.
It's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child's tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.
"Its a good tablet. Fast, durable and easy to use. I especially love the parental features that are available. I am more of a fan of android tablets but for a little toodler this is far better."
"Its a great set up for kids, my daughter loves it and plays it all the time."
Just what she needed to keep her interested in short games & letters
Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids
Limited use if you dont want to enroll with amazon
"Love how it is easy , kid friendly, and my son loved it."
Love that I could get it in a color! And it's just the right size for little hands.
Love the warranty that comes with this! It makes it very conducive for kids to use!
"My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops."

"This is great for kids, it grows up with them, all the apps are good. My kid loves it"
This is the best purchase I've mad in a tablet my daughter loves it
This product is a perfect learning tool for my daughter
This tablet is great for kids. It has so many apps and videos that can be downloaded. It has a nice size screen as well. The only thing I don't like is the charger.

Wonderful educational tool for my niece with special needs.
Wonderful product to have for toddlers and preschoolers.
Works well and looks great for kids. Limited internet access though.
Would definitely recommend to family and friends that have little kids great learning tablet
my 2 almost 3 year old son for Christmas it is great even for adults as well very sturdy and holds but to a wild 2 year old
This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!
"My kids love this product, as do I. Parental restrictions can be set and they know when they have to shut them off. Good battery life too."
"Bought for my kid, it's great for him, the apps are good, the free time, bumper and warranty make it worry free!"
I got this for my one and two year old girls and I don't have any complaints! The battery life isn't great but I don't really mind that!
I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
"My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"
My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!
"My son is constantly distracted and loves technology. Him being only two years old, this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble."
"Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now."
This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.
"lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!"
I have a four year old daughter who has learned a lot from using this tablet. The child feature is great because she can access everything for her age in one area ( with parental settings of course). I really love this tablet
I am so glad I got my son (5 1/2 years old) the Fire Kids Edition Tablet! It is extremely durable & provides hours of educational entertaining fun!!!
I got this for my two grandsons (ages 2 & 4) for Christmas. They love them.
It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.
My son's love there tablet. Great but for the price
Bought it for my 8 year old and it was perfect. She loves it and works it with ease.
Loved this. Bought it for my 5 year old. Can't wait.
The product is easy for grandson to operate and navigate through and seems to be very durable
"this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids."
Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
Bought this for my three year old when I bought a new car with no tv in it. She loves that I can download shows and movies and then watch others on wifi.
"Works great, easy to use for my 4 year old. I can adjust settings easily. Easy set up"
She has dropped it a few times and the case is just great
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it
"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"
I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.
My daughter who is two loves it. She colors and dose puzzles
Got this for my 4 year old. Seems like a great tablet for a young kid to use. I'll edit this after Christmas when I give it to her.
Highly impressed with my purchase. Allows me to use my iPad again since my 3 years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet. Great support and numerous educational apps for children!
My grandkids love it. They use it at home and when we travel.
My grandkids love to use it. It has so much for them to choose and they learn too.
Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account
Great for my kids. Syncs to all of our Amazon videos and netflix. The protective kids case is a must. Makes it easier for smaller kids to hold without touching the screen. Also does well with drops to the ground
My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her
This is really very comfortable and easy as well as strong for toddler my baby really enjoy using this amazon fire kids
This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!
"We are super happy with the kindle fire. We had bought several DVD players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. Now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read. It also doubles as a tablet for me since it gives the options for different profiles. We love it!"
"My 4 year old loves it. Easy to function and pretty tough, it has been dropped a few times and did not crack or break."
"Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better."
As long as apps are downloaded before leaving WIFI they work great for road trips or hunting trips!
Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive
Good for smaller kids that cannot play or get to play on Xbox games with 7 other Siblings
Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well
Great for smaller kids who are Too young to play or get a turn to play on Xbox games with 7 siblings
My daughter loves it keeps the kids occupied. I would recommend to anyone with kids
Got one for my 4yr old. She loves it. It's very durable. I love that I can switch accounts and use it for myself too.
Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone whit kids
Great tablet for the kids as it includes some good educational apps and has a good case that surrounds it for durability.
My son loves his own kindle! Very kid friendly and easy for him to use. It is great that he now has his own!
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
"Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week."
"Bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves it. The case makes it so much easier for little hands to hold. He's dropped it a few times and it's pretty solid, no scratches!"
Just purchased as a Christmas gift for my glambaby & she loves it !!!! Very nice case for little clumsy & at times rough hands!!!
My son is 22 months and he love it. He watches his favorite shows.
"Perfect..grandson, age 16 months, just loves it! No worries if dropped."
Very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use.
Absolutely love Kindle Kids Edition. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids.
My nephew always uses my sister's iphone when watching videos. He loves his youtube videos lol. So I went out and bought him this. The kid loves it. There's value in the cartoon membership also
This tablet has been great for my three year old. Only complaint is that you can't turn off the app download function on free time or see a complete list of what has been downloaded.
It's a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level.
My 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. She is really catching on to using technology . She loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.
"Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me."
My son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and I can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc.. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.
The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.
"My two daughters really enjoy using their Fire tablet. It is really easy to use, sturdy, high definition, has tons of awesome apps integrated for children. My girls were Apple users, yet it was easy to transition."
This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.
Small and easy to use for children when traveling.
i actually purchased for a friends daughter and she is very happy
This tablet is the best for kids. Switching from kids to adult is awesome! Works perfect and has lots and lots of apps for kids
My three year old son love it. He can read and learn so much from the free time app.
My kids love their tablets. They play games and take pictures.
Great tablet for a toddler to start on! The parental controls can be fiddled with a little bit but good anyways!
A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use!
Our grand daughter is very happy with her fire kids edition. Product wotks great.
Purchase it for my granddaughter and she love it many great children's app for learning
Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.
Good quality & worth the price!! We are happy!!!!!
"I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers!"
The kid really love this kindle fire. The protection for the kindle help protect the kindle
I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money
Wonderful tablet for the kids. It comes in nice colors and has so many nice features.
I hope that Azi will like to have her own entertainment instead of playing games on the cell phone.
I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.
I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.
Needed something for Christmas for five year old grandaughter. This hit the spot.
"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase."
Grand daughter is two years old and watches her older brother and sister use their iPads. So we got her the Amazon Fire Kids Addition and she loves it. She has a great time with learning numbers and the alphabet.
I highly recommend this product for children with special needs
My granddaugther constantly drops her tablet and this is perfect for her.
Great gift for the price. Brought for 2 year old grandson.
Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.
This is a very good tablet for kids to use. You can set up time them to play game and time to read!
I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.
My nephew love it. He uses it every day thank you.
"So we gave it to my 1yr old for christmas, on the box it says if you break any way theyll replace, 30sec after opening he throws it down and jumps on .... works great lol loves watching spongbob on lol"
This has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed.
This tablet has grt performance and good camera and long backup. 2 year warranty make lifw more easy for parent's.
"My 3 year old is learning so much playing the games on this tablet, and I love that it is so durable and can take a beating. Would recommend. Many games to match many age groups. Plus YouTube access."
What impressed me the most was the amount of free kids apps that you get with the Kindle. These are easy to use in both size and software.
Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet
Great tablet for my kiddos they love these kindle fire kid tablets and they are very strong hold up to a lot. Price is great too.
I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7yr old granddaughter and it's very easy for her to use.
"I bought this tablet for my 5-year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. It's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games."
I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
"I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"
I needed something for a young kid and this tablet was suggested to me from a sales person at Best Buy. The kid loves it.
"I've purchased other kids tablets, but this is the best. It's user friendly and interactive. My grandson carries it with him where ever he goes."
It is a great starter tablet for young kids. My son really enjoyed it.
love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price"
"My daughter (4) she loves it. Easy to navigate, hard to break."
My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was
"My kids loved it, they were able to learn how to use it right away"
My kids really enjoyed this tablet. Its kid friendly...
Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.
This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.
"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer.
Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it
I like the fact that there is parental control plus by putting your child's age the kindle will only send you games that are designed for your child's age
My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!
This is a great kindle for kids to use as it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down.
I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing 1 for another grandchild in October. They love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them.
Awesome for kidsIt's educationalI love the blue cover!!!
I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
"Easy to use, love the color and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up very happy with my purchase."
I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.
"Bought this for my 4yo daughter for Christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. It survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the USB power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. However this is where Amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for Amazon to replace if damaged. I called customer service, they took my info and I had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!"
Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities.
"I purchased this for my youngest grandson, age 4 for christmas and he will be receiving it shortly. Games have been downloaded and it will be charged and ready to use when he opens his gift."
"This was purchased for my older grandson, age 6, for Christmas and as I stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him."
Great unit my neice can use when traveling to watch videos and take photos.
I love this this memory card. The price was good ty
Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer
This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
My grandson used my old I Phone to play on. Got him this tablet and he loves it! Great deal!
I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
"I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!"
Bought this item for my 1 yr old and at first would not pay attention to it since he loves to run around. But when we are out its a good tablet for a kid and very durable since kids tend to drop toys. We use it to watch movies and even kid educational apps. It's a good buy for the price and to entertain the kids. Video quality is very good.
Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features
Easy for kids to use. Keeps them entertained for hours. Love it!
Exactly what I needed for my hand daughter. She loves it and leaves mine alone.
Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price
"Got this for my 7 year old daughter, she loves it. We read on it, she plays on it, there are videos on it, and she can't or hasn't found a way to break it yet. Well done Amazon, well done."
Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.
Great product easy to set up and use my child loves it
I bought 1 a year ago for our oldest kid. Came back this year and bought two more. Built really well. This is the best choice for a kids tablet.
"I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. Her only disappointment is that she is unable to access the ""Musicality"" app."
It was the best Christmas Present for my grandson.
Keeps the kids busy with games and activities and they really like it
Kids love playing with it. We use it for netflix and for basic games
Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!!
My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!
My daughter is going to love this for christmas!!! Thanks best buy.
"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip.
My granddaughter loves this and it came as promised.
My grandson loves it and there are lots of educational games .
My kids loved and i very happy for this tablet. Thanks
We love the free time feature. Definitely going to end up subscribing after the free year trial is up. Our 2 year old loves it and we can control how long she's on it.
Great product and great service from bestbuy online
"Purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since I notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing."
My 4 year old daughter loves her fire for kids. Keeps her very entertained at all times
The only complaint is that you get a year free of Amazon free time but after that first year you start getting charged till you cancel.
eady enough for my 3 year old to use by herself. Can turn it on and choose her app. Comes with s protective case. Great product for kids to learn on.
got this product for my granddaughter. im #1 grandma now
This is for my 5 year old and she hasn't put it down since Christmas. She uses it for watching videos and taking pictures of her toys..
The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.
This tablet is great for kids. I bought it for my Grandson and he is delighted with it. He uses it constantly.
Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse.
"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there."
"My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use."
Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.
This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!
After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this.
I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.
My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!
Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them!
I feel that this tablet was the perfect fit for my boys age 8 and 6.
My granddaughter is enjoying it thoroughly. My son likes the various parental controls
"Great starter to teach young children how to play games with parental control of what game,movie or music sites. And the plastic protector case is included"
Got this for my 3 yo and he is enjoying it. The case is worth it's price in gold.
Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.
"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
We purchased this for our 3 year grandson for Christmas and he just fell in love with it. Great learning tool to start kids off with!
"I bought this tablet for my granddaughter. She loves it, it's easy for her to use, and just right for her size."
"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."
My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use.
Bought this for a 8 yr old and its perfect for what she like to do
We gave this tablet to our nine year old Grandaughter for her birthday. She loves it and we feel it is very sturdy. That is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children.
The unit is well made and has tons of features for children six years and over. Was amazed at the low price and how easy it to handle even for a six year old!
Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.
Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it
Bought this for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it good learning tool along with great fun for him!
"Bought this for my 4 yr. old for Christmas, she loves it and is very easy to use. The battery lasts a long time"
Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it.
Bought this for my two yr old and she loves it not to mention super durable.
Excellent tablet.....withstands a special needs Grandson.
Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.
Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids
Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi
Great tablet for a great price. Timely & free shipping
"Great tablet for the grandkids, they love it great item"
Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids
I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it
"I bought this tablet for my son so he could have something to entertain him on our road trips. It works great. I love the child-proof case that it comes with. My only complaint is that the interface is slow sometimes. I'm honestly not surprised though, because it runs off of Android. I typically avoid Android but I figured I would give it a shot. After using this tablet, I think I will avoid using Android products again. Besides the slowness of the Android OS, it is still a great tablet."
I buy this tablet for my nephew and he is happy with it.
"I got this tablet to replace my sons old one, I love the adult/child profile and the ability to have the 2 year replacement warranty. The case has also came in handy many times."
"My daughter has been wanting one for quite sometime! I love the durability, and that I can set limits to what she does!!"
My daughter loves this tablet. She drops it and it keeps going. she can't put it down.
"MY DAUTHER LOVES THIS TABLET, IS EXCELLENT FOR A 3 YEARS OLD CHILDREN"
My girls love the tablet. It has lots of apps they can download. The only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.
My granddaughter loves her tablet toddler friendly
My granddaughter loves this tablet. It's the perfect gift for a 2 year old
My grandson loves this tablet kid friendly .He plays with this all the time .
My kids love the tablet and the battery life is amazing.
"My son is fascinated with this tablet, and iam too."
"My son loves it! So many great games, audiobooks and apps for kids, and we love the timer feature so we can set time for him to let him play before bedtime. Very worth it!"
Only wish games worked without internet once downloaded
tablet is so user friendly and a price you can not beat
The kids love it and are always on it. Would recommend to anyone.
The Kindles were good while they worked 3 days!! Best Buy was good about replacing them. Very frustrating though to have to get them replaced when my kids only played on them for three days.
This is one of the best kids tablets I have purchased. It's not as restricted and complicated to operate as other tablets I have tested.
"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100"
"We have dropped it a few times and the case is great. There is a ton of memory, great price. And how did I never know about Amazon underground. It's a great product and great price. I definitely recommend"
"Works great for my daughter, great price and apps."
"I bough this for my daughter and it's perfect for her little tiny hands, I just wish that the screen would lock when she is watching her shows because she gets excited and touches the screen and it pauses or chances the show or it goes to other apps. Overall it's a great product for a small child"
We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.
I'm very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it.
"My granddaughter had been using her parents' iPad and loves using apps for learning. I thought it would be nice for her to have her own tablet. My daughter loves the parental limits that can be set and my granddaughter loves not having to ""share"" with her parents!"
I absolutely love the parental controls on this device. You can even set a time limit on how long they can use it.
Bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality. The case protects it well.
I bought this product for my 4 year old grandaughter and she loves using it
This tablet was for my great-grandson and he loved it
He loves his kindle takes it everywhere. does school work on it plus plays games Excellent piece of equipment.
I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skills in counting and reading in English and foreign languages. She also enjoys having the tablet to read stories to her as it lights up the words for her to read along. She loves the ability to watch her favorite programs as well. This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase.
It has been a great product for our son. Easy to use and excellent for learning and playing games. Video quality is very good as well.
My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe
This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.
It's an excellent learning tablet for a child. I would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.
My husband and I purchased 3 of these for each of our kiddos and to say they're a hit would be a massive understatement. And the parental controls on these are awesome. We love our new Fires!!
Got this for my Grandson's birthday. He really wanted a tablet and I wanted something that wasn't so breakable. He was so excited and he loves it
This is a great tablet for a kid! It is easy to use and play on!
My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
Bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it! The child case is awesome too in case of any drops.
I gave this Tablet to my nephew and he can't put it down. It is very Durable. Great Product!
"Love this tablet! Highly recommended, especially for a toddler who's learning. Has lots of games and activities for learning, parental controls, which I find extremely necessary for the internet today!"
"My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this ""big game"" as he calls it."
The tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. She is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. I like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps.
Very pleased with product. I was also a decent price and not overpriced.
We bought this for our 2 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! It has so many apps and videos for her to watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child.
I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.
My six year old turned this tablet on immediately on Christmas Day. He knew how to operate it easily.
Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
Keeps my kids busy for hours the apps are excellent
I bought the tablet for my 2 year old as a birthday present. I downloaded the apps I thought he would enjoy and handed it to him. He caught on to some really quick while others hes still a little young. Overall the quality and durability is excellent.
my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the books for school & screen size is prefect
This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old.
Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.
This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.
Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. She would use her Mom's phone to watch her shows but now that she has her tablet she can watch her own and see it much better. Homerun on this Christmas present!
Easy to maneuver. And great case for protection. The battery does not keep a charge long but I'm used to the iPad.
"I purchased two of these tablets, one for my niece, one for my nephew, as they are often fighting over the tablet. It is a great platform, with awesome apps, and comes equipped with a very sturdy and rugged case. Five stars. Worth every penny."
It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.
"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made ."
My brother told me about this product. I bought it for my son and he loves it.
Nice product . Love the fact that my 5 years sons are gaining computer experiance.
we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them these are the best tablets on the market they have great learning apps on them aswell
"What I really like is that you can set up different profiles( boy,girl and myself ) and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile.I bought 2 and kids are very happy."
Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it.
Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom. I thought I saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if I find this to be true. Would hate to be charged for what the kindle was intended for.
My 5 and 8 year olds love these tablets. They are able to play age appropriate content. Tablet seems well powered and the case is providing good protection.
My daughter loves the games/videos that she can watch on it during the day and my wife uses it to read on during the evening. This thing gets used a lot! Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
Bought one last year that worked out well. Decided to get another one this year. Very pleased.
Excellent tablet for my grandkids. Durable. Awsome 2 year free replacement if damaged for any reason
Keeps my granddaughter busy. She was showing me how to use it. Now she doesn't want to use mine.
Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!
"Bought this for my Granddaughter, she absolutely loves it!"
Easy to use for a 5 year old. She loves it. I just don't like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet.
First time using Amazon Fire programming. So far my child and I love the apps and programs. I really love the parental limits and time limits I can set. And that I can set learning and reading limits before play.
"Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it"
Great for my four year old. She is able to access all her learning games with ease.
"Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps."
Great tablet for kids my boys love their tablets!!
Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.
Holds charge well. Portable. Lightweight and as best we can tell nearly indestructible. Perfect for kids
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 4YR OLD. WE HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET AS IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. FROM WHAT I READ THIS WILL DO THE JOB FOR HIM. THE PRICE AND COLOR WAS GREAT.
I bought this item for my 9 year old son. He loves it and it has nice feaures such as parental controls.
I bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them. I would recommend.
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view.
I loooooove this tablet as well as my 3 year old with all the kids apps make it way more fun and safe for kids to enjoy
I love this tablet for kids .. it's so much fun for them .. great buy ...
"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid."
I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn't work any more.
"I really love this tablet for my toddler! The only things I have against it are that there is no kickstand on it, it may lag at times, and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie can't be exited. Other than that it's a great tablet."
It is a nice tablet for kids and my son enjoys it.
It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
It's a great beginner tablet for kids allows you to ensure your kids are viewing and playing contents for their age.
My 3yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet! Now she can watch Mickey Clubhouse whenever she wants.
My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books
My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.
"My daughter love her tablet. And is easy to use, and the battery last longer.."
My granddaughter loves her pink tablet she is four and able to use on her own
My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight
My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.
Our 4 grand kids use these daily charge after charge sometimes .youngest is almost 3 oldest is 9 Just watch the charging cable connection easily broken if charging while using
Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes!
Purchased for a 5 year old. Perfect for kids and as a first tablet.
"Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app."
Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!
"This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things. My husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. I had no problems getting it replaced."
This is a great tablet for kids. Its got great parental controls and its easy for the kids to use. I even enjoy playing angry birds on it
We decided to buy the tablet so our toddler could play educational games on hers instead of going for my iPad. I love how we can block her from going on the Internet as well as set a curfew. It's easy to use and my daughter loves it!
We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time!
"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro SD card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson."
Kindle Fire meets the needs of kids and/or adults-
The Amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages . Ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire.
"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
"I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!"
"I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue. They was for my 5 and 7 years children. They really love their tablets. Yes, it was a birthday gift."
Love this tablet! It's easy to setup and the pre-loaded games were a hit with my little one! Very pleased with the the selection of videos and games on Amazon Kid Play :)
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Love the fact that it has a two year warranty against breakage and also comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time.
We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.
My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to
My daughter loves it. So easy to set up. And keeps everything age appropriate.
This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.
"Great tablet for kids. Big choice of apps, great price."
"Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love!"
"This is the second tablet I've purchased aimed for little ones and it's by far the best. Easy to access his games and plenty of preloaded games, videos and apps. It makes road trips so much happier!"
I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden
Great tablet for my three year old son It's really easy for him to use
My daughter like her tablet it's so simple to use.
"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint."
Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.
Easy to navigate. Color is good. Duarable. My son has had many fun hours playing with it
"Love the case, table works very well, easy to download game and apps, but the life of the battery is not great. The battery fully charged only last about 3-4 hours"
I like that this tablet can grow with my 5 year old. I love the various age settings and the parental controls. Perfect first tablet!
Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers.
Easy to use and teach my granddaughter not easily breakable
"He loves it. He likes the camera and the apps, going to have to get one my granddaughter too."
Excellent product thanks !Thanks for the help choosing what I was looking for and all the variety of apps that are available on this one.
"My niece is 2 years old and she absolutely loves this tablet. It's easy for her to use and navigate through. Plus, it has parental controls which I love. Definitely recommend it."
This tablet is just the right size for my son's hands. Easy for him to use
Brought this for my daughter and it's been a life saver!!! I love that it already comes with the pink bumper it's perfect for her!! Set up was also a breeze!!! I'm very pleased with this purchase.
We purchased three of these tablets for our granddaughters and they use them everyday and enjoy them. We spoke with one of the Best Buy associates and he was great telling us about this product. Made our decision easy. Thanks.
My kids are on their tablets for hours on end. I was able to download several preschool apps for them. They actually are learning very well. The tablet us simple to use and they can navigate themselves on the tablet very easily.
"What a great tablet for for the grand kids.easy to use,can't say how many times it's hit the floor and no damage."
Has all the functionality a child needs with easy parental controls. Like the child profile with only approved content.
I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA
My son loves the tablet. I like that Amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two years
Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!"
My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
My 3yo loves it and never wants to put it down. Lots of preloaded educational games and videos!
"My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it."
Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
Purchased this item after another tablet stopped working in less than a year of having. Couldn't go wrong with the two year no worry gurantee and the one year free subscription of Amazon FreeTime. Have had for about a month and it was been well worth the money already.
"Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect."
"Great tablet for toddlers. Easy yet fun. I purchased two tablets for my grandkids, ages 2 and 4. They both love it and enjoy playing with it."
I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.
I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it!
I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.
This tablet is perfect for a young child. The case it comes with is wonderful and seems very protective.
Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play.
"I purchased this tablet for my 10 year old son and he loves it. Great for movies, games and reading books online. Definetly would recommend it as a starter tablet for young children. The hard protective cover is a plus."
This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.
"I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8."
This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.
"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead"
"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos
I bought this tablet for my 1 year old and he loves it! It keeps him entertained when we go places and he has learned so much. The apps are great and perfect for him. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet.
This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.
I bought the tablet for my one year old son so we can use it in the car. It just a great buy. I recommend it to anyone that has young kids.
I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily.
Purchased this tablet for my grandson who is two years old. He loved it!. But the power cord and the tablet hook up didn't work very long. I will be taking it back for a replacement. As long as the connection stays snug it's a great tablet.
This tablet is great for a child. It will stand up to accidental drops and has just enough expandability for future use. I give it 5 star!
"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
I bought 2 of these tablets for my Grandsons that both have Autism. They can be very hard on things and this is 1 tablet neither boy has been able to break yet. they are very easy for them to use and they LOVE them. The only thing with them is you need an Amazon account for them.
This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.
I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
great the kids love it for learning on and great on long trips
Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
"Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up"
I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!
The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.
"Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing."
"reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use"
This washer and dryer is very basic but still nice with lots of options. Great for my small family. Worth the money!
"Bought these for my 5yr old twin grandkids and the enjoy the learning games so much. Love that you can limit how long child is engaged with apps, games, or movies on this and that my daughter can use her amazon prime acct with this! 2yr amazon warranty is amazing as well"
Got it for my son and he loves it! Definitely would recommend it!
Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too!
Love it!! My two year old loves to watch Sesame Street & football
Purchased for our niece. She is 6 years old and it's perfect for her. She loves it!
Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.
Great for the child. Unfortunately it doesn't have a volume limit setting
By far the greatest tablet for kids. Free time is fantastic. I don't have to worry about content for my child. And the two year worry free warranty is in heard of. 2 thumbs up
This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe
Is good for the kids The only thing is I have to get a SD Card for more memory
Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this
Hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on.
bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy
Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
Purchased for an3 year old that wanted this badly. Appears to be rugged. Links up with my amazon account for content and access. 2 year warranty. Win!!!
My daughter hasn't put it down since Christmas. We're both in love! It's very easy for her to operate (she's 2) and very easy to set up. It's a win win for both parent and child.
Help my 2 year learn he loves to play it and watch movies on it
Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find
"Bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. She really enjoys it."
Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy!
So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
"Boy! If I had something like this when I was a kid. The learning devices these kids have today. Makes learning about different things in & around the world a fun experience. all the other activities & downloadable apps, they can be on it for hours. Like it!"
I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
"We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too."
I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case
Brought it for my niece for a Christmas and she loves it doesn't lag or anything it works just fine
I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.
"My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink."
Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
"You can not block Bing and it shows ""trending now"" News content. This can not be deleted or blocked. It also types ahead and adds content."
"Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!"
I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.
my great grandson loves this he plays games and looks at all his pictureshe is only 2
I bought this tablet because it was very inexpensive and the right size and fit for my daughter...
My grandson can operate the kindle fire with no problem. Just the right size for his little hands.
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!
My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.
I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great
So it is working great. She loves the learning games
"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
Definitely a good product children of all ages in elementary school.
"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible."
volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.
The parental control could be a lot better. It's nice and compact. She loves it
I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it
Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
My daughter can't get enough of this tablet. The only thing I would suggest that you have YouTube kids as a pre installed app. The adds are ridiculous for children when you download it from the App Store.
"It's a good tab for the kids, keeps them busy. Wish the speed was faster."
"Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!"
"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
"My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips."
"This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don't want to do much else"
It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!
Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this.
"We had been using the Nabi for our 3 year old, but after the reviews online about the dreamtab we decided on the amazon fire kids tablet. So far so good. Very easy for our son to navigate without worry about getting on unauthorized websites."
I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!
My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!
My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages
Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy
My daughter loves her tablet I love free time love the case it came with just right to buy for a kids first tablet
This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.
"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it
"My daughter loves it! She uses it with ease, which makes me an mommy very happy. No complaints. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Very helpful employees at Best Buy as well."
This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!
"Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device."
"This tablet is great. Because it's from Amazon, you can easily switch to a different profile and use it when the kids finally put it down. I have 2 1/2 year old twins and it's hard to get them to sit down. With the Kid's Kindle Fire, they are more than happy to settle down on the couch and play. I highly recommend buying one. It is a life saver!"
Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better
Very study tablets. 2 others grands liked theirs. Salesman was very helpful finding 2 different color models
Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets.
"Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too."
Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them
"It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable!"
my grandkids love it. This is the 3 one we bought.
"Our kids love it and the Amazon unlimited is fantastic with tons of options. However, our kids still fight over usin our grownup tablet bc the screen is larger."
Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case
My kids love the tablet and it's easy for them to use
"A great little tablet built for kids with access to volumes of free apps for a year, including books, games, etc. It can be easily used by kids of almost any age."
My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!
"They keep busy, lots of kids apps to view!! Entertainig"
Works great. Easy to set time limits and goals. Easy to set up multiple profiles. Excellent product. As advertised.
Probably a little too much but the device has excellent parental controls. They have used it for about a week so far with no issues.
My kids love these. I purchased 3 of them at one time. They seem really durable.
"My children think these are the greatest. I'm kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank."
A few problems with games loading but over all good
"great tablet for children, lots of content. games books etc and easy for my 4 y.o to use."
"Great, non-expensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my Ipad."
It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.
"The grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use"
"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it."
"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product."
"Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics."
Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
Kids Kindle was a Christmas present for great grandson age 4. His mother has downloaded many word games and etc. from Amazon's childrens library. A big feature of the Kindle is the case and the 2 year no fault warranty. His Mother says he loves the Kindle and uses it all the time. Great purchase.
it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.
"Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games."
"I bought this for my daughter. It's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. She's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it."
"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"
Need to have better info for special needs children. The kids utube is confusing but love the guarantee
I love this product. My kids love it. It is very to use and has a nice display.
My grandbaby loves hers. We gave it as a Christmas present!
My son is 6 and I can control everything he does on his tablet! I love it and love that learning games came installed
Bought it for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. Get purchase!!!
"I bought 3 for my three granddaughters for Christmas. They love it. I love it too, free games, books, movies"
I need the Geek Squad to help me with the Amazon Prime I purchased it for 2 granddaughters but I don't want them to have access to my books.
It's simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times.
My 6 and 4 year old boys love it and so do the parents
My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.
"My kids love this tablet. There are over hundreds of games, books, and shows to pick from"
"My niece loves this tablet. It's very durable, but charges slow"
Tablet is for my 2 year old son and it has great learning game so for him! He's learning to read and so much more!
The Kindle fire kids edition is a parent worry free solution to kids messing up potential settings love that you can set up a personal code and create multiple profiles
The only draw back to this device is no internet service included. My 1 year old granddaugther loves hers and I don't leave home without it.
The parental controls are amazing! Super easy for my daughter to operate
This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.
Very easy to use by a 2 year old. Love how I can limit the time use.
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Perfect for a 5 year old
"Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the ""FIRE"""
I bought one for my son for his birthday. Loved it so much I bought a second one for my self.
Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.
Great for my kiddo! He loves to watch Sesame Street on it :)
"I love the parental controls available. You can set what time they can start and stop using, as well as how much time on each activity. Also love the guarantee of replacement."
"My kids enjoy this tablet, as do I! The only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.Also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken."
My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy!
I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts
This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.
Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one!
"It's get for my 6 and 4 year old boys, and they love them"
This thing has it all...even the cartoons that my older kids watched. Plenty of activities and teaching. 5 stars
Love this kid's tablet - it's kid proof! It's perfect for kids of all ages!
"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination"
My granddaughter loves this tablet it is durable..
The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.
Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well
"Great little lap top with touch screen, absolutely ruins you."
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. We take it everywhere.
Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet
"So far the 1yo loves it. I thought it would be too much, but no."
"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service....."
Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.
The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it.
It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.
"Great for my one year old baby,he loves to play games and watch movies.."
"My son loves this tablet, he will not put it down!"
"Got this to replace my iPhone that my daughter constantly has to have to watch her Elmo videos. This is a durable perfect solution. She understands most of the apps and can navigate to watch whatever she wants. This comes with a warranty that if she does anything to break it, it will be replaced for free. That was the final selling point I needed!"
My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it.
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.
This was a Christmas present for my 3 year old son. He loves having his own 'pad pad'. He sees everyone else with a tablet and can now play age appropriate games and watch his shows without me having to worry.
"My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight."
It is easy and fun to use. This was a gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. She can play on it for hours.
i have not had any issues with it. i like the separate profiles so i can use it too with out him getting online. plus i can down load a app and if it is suitable for him i can add it to his profile.
This tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.
My 4 year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him!
I am pleased that my 6 year old grandson was happy with his gift
No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.
"Perfect for kids. He has his own tablet, and I can control all access to everything. I don't have to worry about what he's getting into...."
"Aiden's is loving his tablet, using educational apps learning his letters and numbers"
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my toddler and she loves it.
my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone.
"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
"My daughter love it, she always get busy with it.."
Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it.
I never have any issues with this company or products!
"Grand child loves it, before she had to look at her favorite movies. On the computer monitor,Now she can look at her movies anywhere."
She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school
this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday
I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.
"Excellent tablet for a young child that is very durable, expandable, inexpensive and my grand daughter loves it."
My grandson is very happy with his Kindle. The case protects it very well.
Basically it does everything that adult Amazon tablet does
I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great
"Sturdy construction, withstands toddlers use or (abuse)"
It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!
This holds my grandson attention on a regular basis.
He loves his new tablet lots of fun and educational games to choose from and best of all very kid proof he has dropped it numerous times and I see no signs of damage whatsoever
My kid loves it. It's really convenient for us to put educational games on it for him.
I purchased 2 of this Amazon Tablet for my 2 kids - 4 & 3yrs old.They just can't keep there eyes off this they fondly call IPAD.My wife laugh every day when they tell her to recharge their IPAD.
Awesome tablet for young children. They love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it.
Got this for my kids they wont put it down but can be confusing with setup
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
"This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price."
It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.
He loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe
"I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though."
"It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
My son loves this product and uses it all the time.
My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.
Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!!
My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter
"This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty."
My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.
This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
"These kindle tablets are beginning to get pretty cheap. Especially when the other kids tablets are relatively close in pricing. Nothing has gone wrong with this Kindle as of now, and our niece has been enjoying it. A kids account and adult account is made. The kids accounts has access to whatever the adults account allows. This is pretty standard in kids tablets, but this one handles it well. It makes it much easier."
I liked it a lot for my four year old and it is kids proof
The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.
It's a lovely game for kids wolf my daughter have one and I love it
Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....
Nice for kids. Like the free apps built in the device. Can control what and how long they get to use screen time
"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating."
Bought for my grandson and the programs that were included with the device give a wide variety of education tools
Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it
Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
Very sturdy for little people who might drop it easy to read
"the product is really crafted for kids n they just glue to it as it offers an array of rich topics, apps, etc"
"Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!"
4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned."
Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
"Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own."
"Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case."
My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.
The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case
i always buy from best buy. they have excellent products.The workers are very knowledgeable of what they sell.Thanks
They had the tablet in stock and it is nice that it has the child settings
i can allow kids what i want them to read or play with
This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild
"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.
It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android
I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though"
Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
"I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this."
Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.
"I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!"
"Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone"
"this item is not good ok ...no use for my kids ,,,"
Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too."
I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.
When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.
Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy
My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.
Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.
"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!
Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
Our young son spends hours fully engaged playing games on his tablet.
This tablet has been a great learning tool for my child.
i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us.
Bought this for a grandchild. Perfect gift. Recommend this.
"Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it."
The guy at the store was really helpful. There was not a pink Fire Kids Edition so he looked on top of all the shelves and found one. My four year old grand daughter loves it.
"This was perfect for entertaining my 20-month old great grandson during car trips, shopping and bedtime."
"With a great child-proof case, this was the perfect tablet to start my little guy off with!"
This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps!
the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy
I own 3 Kindles. They are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. The case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. It's easy to use and she loves it.
I bought this for my toddler and its perfect. He is rough with it and it still works. I wanted something that I use to teach him the basics of using a tablet and this worked great. It comes with a 2 yrs warranty.
I have a 3 year old at home. Best purchase ever! Indestructible. Reliable. Easy to program. I would highly recommend this.
"So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine."
my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!
"My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well"
"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
Easy to set up and turn on and off restrictions. Piece of mind that daughter can't access adult appropriate content
I like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. It has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .
My daughter loves this! Expandable storage helps when we make our twice yearly drive to Texas and all the games and apps are definitely age appropriate so I don't have to worry about get getting onto anything she isn't supposed to be on!
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books."
"Bought this for my grandniece, keeps her entertained. Can't beat the price."
It's all the great features of the Fire but with added bonuses for the kids. The app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.
"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.
"This is perfect for my 3 year old. He loves this. The charger can be a little tricky at times, so I do have to be the one to plug it in. I've made sure to download a few of his favorite things on it for when we are offline & it's worked just fine. I will be buying an SD card soon to give him more room though, but we haven't run into any issues so far."
Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.
I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.
Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1
These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.
I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.
Perfect for my grandson I love the easy to use set up and parental control. I have recommended this to my friend for her children. Case is great
This has the all speed and storage I needed for my first grader. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.
"The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows"
I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.
"I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee."
This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.
My kids love their kindles and love free time in it. Numerous educational games!
Piece of mind that the little one won't wonder the World Wide Web and be exposed to things no parent wants to have to explain!
"My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands."
"Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself"
I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.
its a great great gift that can be used by everyone
My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.
My 3 year old has one and my 10 year old wanted one so now they BOTH have one. The parental controls are easy to use and work great. I would highly recommend to anyone!
"I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it."
"Got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! Lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. What really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that Amazon offers!"
"This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it."
"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied."
"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids."
I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.
This tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. It has lots of fun apps for the kids.
"We bought these knowing we had a couple of long plane rides ahead of us...we have not regretted them one bit. They are easy to use for the kids, come with lots of fun apps/games/books...Best part for us was being able to add a memory card, so we could add movies and as many apps as we needed without worrying about space."
"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.
I love that this tablet came preloaded. All we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level.
Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.
I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera"
"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version."
Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.
"This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus"
"Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
Don't shop around! Great parental controls. Easy to set up
"Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
"Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. I will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product"
My daughter loves her tablet. I couldn't have made a better purchase.
This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying."
she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
"I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops
We got this for our three year old daughter. At first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my iPad
Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
"The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft."
"It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
"Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer."
"I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it."
Bought this for a 2 year old. She loves it! She's already got more things figured out on it than I do!. Good educational programs and some fun ones too!
"I am so very i got this for my 3 year old grandson. He can navigate it to get to his favorite shows, Peppa pig, Mickey clubhouse and Thomas the train. He is so happy with his tablet."
"Better loading, longer battery life, clearer picture, more space. Still just as durable!"
"After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg"
You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
"Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The 'excited factor' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either."
My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome
My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.
Easy to navigate and my son just loves it pkus a year free of service.
Great purchase for my son's 6th birthday. He love it and the kid account is a great addition
"My two year old loves the videos,games and books this tablet provides."
Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it.
"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long."
My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!
Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
"This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling."
kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there
It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
Was a great birthday present for my son that only gets to use it when it's absolutely necessary.
Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.
nice and easy-to-use for a 3 yr old ..............
The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.
"I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet"
This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.
I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device
Gift for great nephew. Have 2 that are 5 and 6 y/o. Both love these tablets because each got one. Play with them as much as Mom allows.
Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.
"Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift."
"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!
"The tablet is just what a child needs, it's tuff and the content is aimed at the children's needs. It keeps them entertained as long as you will let them."
This tablet has great storage capacity. I have downloaded all kinds of children's movies and learning activities. It's great.
Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.
I have a kindle fire and love mine so I decided to get one for each of the grandkids. There are so many learning games that are fun for them plus you have parental control
"The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better!"
We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.
"My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away."
"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
"My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case."
I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new.
"Where do I begin? It comes with an amazing thick case, it's a fully functioning tablet. It also comes with a one year subscription to educational games and movies/ shows. If it breaks Amazon replaces! How could you choose any other tablet? This was so great we had to get two!"
"I was impressed with the overall of this Kindle, it has so many nice features and easy access."
This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.
"I bought one last year for my 1 1/2 years old granddaughter and believe me, she loves it. She deals with it perfectly. We put a 128 GB card and downloaded music, videos and movies. And she finds everything. A few days ago I bought another for my twins grankids. They are only 11 month old but we are going to start putting their music and movies. With the bluetooth they will enjoy it. I got a Free in-store set up so their mom will learn how to use it."
"My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it."
"I bought the Tablet for my grandson for Christmas. It was the best investment that I have made in all time. He is learning so much that he can't put it down. As a matter of fact, he sleeps this it just about every night."
I purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter after having purchased her older sister one last year when she was 3. It's comforting knowing it has as durable cover to endure the energy of a toddler.
Good value for the price and for the children. The apps are enough to let them play and read.
We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
Touch response is not so good. so my kid refused to play games on this.Returned this product. Thanks to Bestbuy for the full refund
"My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading"
"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!"
Glad that I get to control the time spent on which sure site and apps.
"I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me."
"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet
Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it
My 3 year old daughter loves playing on her fire. The apps are all very entertaining and easy enough for her to use.The only thing I have had difficulty with is accessing youtube or the internet.
Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.
The service was great and the help I received thanks
The kids couldn't wait to turn them on and I'm very excited.
My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.
"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty."
"Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads"
So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
Love how easy it is for my 9 year old sone to navigate around. The unlimited kindle free time is great too we like that we are able to set time limits as well as only allow age appropriate games and content. Our son Not only loves playing Minecraft and watching netflix on it but enjoys the reading the books as well.
This was a gift to my niece. Her mom liked the parental controls
We purchased this as a gift and the feedback we have received has been great.
I will recommend for other parents to buy this product
There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!"
The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
"It's really a good product to buy for kids. A lot of educational games . They can their favorite kids show from youtube, Netflix etc. The cover is really good. I'm gonna another one for my daughter."
May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained.
"7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge."
Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
"This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use."
I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding
Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!
"My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it."
"This is a great tablet for kids. Keeps them busy with so much to do, watch, and create."
Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.
I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.
"Love this for my youngest. He had a Nabi, but it just wasn't as user friendly as this is."
"I bought this as a gift for my elementary school aged niece. She immediately put it to work playing games and watching video. Her face lit up and in the nearly two months since I purchased it for her, she's had no problems!"
"Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty."
Simple to operate for a 3 yr old . Would recommend
Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues
"Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device"
I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
"I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."
Grandson picked it up & used it right away. He enjoys the tablet.
my son has been using our computer and we got him this and he never looked back.
"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product."
"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it."
"Such a great deal for a small fee, just right for a toddler of three."
I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids
This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
"This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far."
"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
"She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL"
"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!!
Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.
Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.
Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
"Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
"Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."
"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
"My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps"
"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear."
This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
"Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!!"
Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.
Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!
"Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."
This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.
"This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
"can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup."
"I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
"Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"
This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .
I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading
"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable
"Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting."
It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
Great tab for my kids. This is the third fire tablet that we have purchased for our kids.
Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me
"Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc."
"Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift."
"When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!"
"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.
This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.
I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.
Ok so in order to get three working well I needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy. All is great! Kids love them!
"I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos"
Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.
Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.
I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times
"Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service"
Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.
my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.
I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.
Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.
Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do.
Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
Great tablet for those invested in the Amazon system. Nice screen and functions well.
I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!!
This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.
This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."
Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."
"I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
"I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.
"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
"New Kindle Fire 8 is easy to setup, great for reading, no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network. I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet."
"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load"
I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.
Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use
I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
"Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
"It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
"This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle."
This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.
Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air
I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.
Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!
Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.
My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."
I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast!
"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
"Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all."
"My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these ""kids"" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell."
"This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
I am enjoying my Kindle very much! Easy to down load books and easy to read! Very happy with my purchase!
"My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose."
"Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,"
My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It's great.
A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. Great deal on a great product.
"This is an awesome product.I also own a paperwhite, if you always read in good lighting I would recommend you save some money and buy this instead of the paperwhite."
My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.
This is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.
We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.
I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!
"I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."
My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.
The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users."
My daughter loves this. There are so many settings and you don't have to buy every app individual. So many books and educational apps :)
My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it
"This tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end."
I used to prefer paper or hardback books but found I had more access to read online. With the kindle I have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.
This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend
"I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked."
This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips
Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily
Love the color pink for granddaughter she loves carrying around her own tablet. Wonderful product. love the safety protective case great unit.
Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.
"We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this"
"Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend."
"We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. ""Why would U want to read in the dark?"" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect."
"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire."
I got this tablet for my 3 year old granddaughter. She enjoys it and it keeps her busy and learning. Everything rolled into one for her.
"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80"
"Bought at $49 in thanksgiving, I owned previous version before and this one has a better build."
Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!
"Great for kids, bought both colors for two of my kids."
"Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well!"
Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning
Great tablet with good parental controls for kids!!
Have had other products similar for the kids but this is the best by far. Best Buy had a great price too so decided to try it. Love it.
I love this table for my 4 year old. Ttje parental controls are Awesome! I also like that it changes up the games for her so she won't get board!
"I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick."
"It's exactly what you'd think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking."
My 4 year old loves it. I love that she can use it unsupervised without worry. She has been learning her alphabet and this has been a great tool.
My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!
My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.
My little 8 year old guy loves this kindle. Couldn't imagine a better Christmas gift.
My son is a huge fan of it and I love that I can control what he watches and plays
This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.
"I bought the first kindle years ago for my sister. When my oldest turned 1, he wouldn't leave her kindle alone. We decided to buy him one & he has had it ever since. The learning apps such as the counting ones, ones about learning shapes, and learning his ABCs, assists in his advancement in his schooling. We all have a kindle in the house, to include my 3 year old (this is his first year with one). Love it!"
"My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!"
Bought it for my granddaughter. She is so smart. She can get on and find her apps. She lives the videos and games.
My 3 year old has gone through 2 tablets prior to her kids fire. I love the parental control and easy use. She loves the apps available through Prime! She drops it daily with no damage to the tablet thanks to the protective case! Thanks for making a very durable product with an incredible warranty!
I bought this as a gift for my grandkids. They absolutely love it!
I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!!
Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
"Bought as Christmas gift. He loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
"Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
"I love this kindle. I've never had one before but I would definitely recommend one to those that are avid or casual readers. No glare, easy to use, easy to bring anywhere."
"I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that's all that matters."
My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down!
"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi."
This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
"I especially loved the bumper that protects it! He absolutely loved this gift! It has parental control. It has the ability to buy games that are educational for him; and we are all thrilled with it....myself, his parents and our little guy!!!!"
Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!
"for the price you cant beat this, my daughter loves it and wont put it down and the protective case def helps when it is dropped trust me , cannot go wrong with a kindle for this price"
I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.
This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops.
Easy to set up. Durable for toddlers. Highly recommend.
"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone."
My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...
Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.
My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She
This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
"I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work."
It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids
Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.
My son loves his tablet. It is very easy to use. Very stutdy.
"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it
"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
Got it to gift to my friend. Absolutely loved it. Good value.
Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter!
This is the best child's tablet and some adults like me can benefit from the warranty and matched case
"amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model"
Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we!
"Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!"
I needed this for my daughter and needed a tablet that cal handle all my daughters apps and have parental saggy This has it all
"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.
I bought this for my grandson and it hasn't disappointed me at all! He loves his tablet! I am looking at buying his sister one next!
"purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it."
My daughter loved it . Best gift for the price it comes with way more then I could have expected
This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
"My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome"
Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
"I'm a father of two. Both of my kids (6) & (10) got iPads last year for Christmas and love them, but I felt the iPad was lacking a little of what they really need. Purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. Perfect kids tablet. Don't make the mistake I did and go with the IPad. This product nails it in every aspect the iPad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet"
"Bought it for our 2 year old son, has really helped with his vocabulary"
Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.
Son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. Nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. No questions asked.
Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.
"I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!"
"Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use."
my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.
I bought the Amazon Kindle so I could enjoy reading without lugging around multiple books. I usually read my ebooks on the Kindle app but I have gotten frustrated with my phone/tablet going into sleep mode. This Kindle is sufficient for my needs. I purchased a reading light for when I'm in low-light situations and it works very well. I am satisfied with my purchase.
Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
"Loving my kindle! Can read all the books I want from the library without leaving the house! And when it‚Äôs time to move, no more heavy boxes to haul!"
This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
I got this because it is almost impossible to break
I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.
The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
"Great gift, for my kid's second birthday! This product is very child friendly and easy to use! I recommend this product for families!"
My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous."
great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
This is the way to go for an all-in-one package for the kids. Everything is set-up and easily controlled through adult log in...
"This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy."
"This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it."
So far it begin good for my 4yrs old toddler. She enjoy every minute of it.The parental control it's a plus. It also allow you to make multiple kid and adults profiles without any problems issues.
"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly."
"My daughter is learning so much from the games on this device, my wife was glad I bought it."
"My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!"
My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained
I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
Purchased this for my son. Decent tablet but not optimum
"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
"I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
"Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!"
My Mistake to buy for 1yr old.But my 30yr old son enjoys it!
It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.
This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
Good tablet durable lots of apps just right for 3 year old
Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it .
We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.
Best tablet for my 2 year old son... it has helped a lot and seems to be the most simple kids tablet system available
Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read
Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.
granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.
Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.
easy on the eyes and perfect for travel. battery life is a +
"Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes and you can adjust the size of the font. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale"
This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
"This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase."
Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. She is able to easily use it with minimum assistance.
"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!"
Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
Perfect tablet for my niece. Don't have to worry about her getting into anything she's not suppose to. Also don't have to worry about her watching things that aren't appropriate for her age.
Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.
This was purchased for my grandson. It has been easy for him to use. Love the parental controls and free time mode. The included bumper case is a bonus.
First time user - had no problem getting started - must have internet connection and know name and password for wi-fi
"My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection."
"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."
Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift.
"Easy to use, easy apps and books, you can use a timer to schedule time use"
Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.
My son loves it. Easy set up. And the best part is the case. It really is childproof. My son has dropped it and nothing had happened. Very durable. Just what my son needed.
This tablet is very kid friendly. You log on the tablet and the kids is having fun...
"not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged (me) I find it easy to work with"
I observe my 4 year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease. She is able to play some of the games and upload movies. Her mom had to put a secret password for the movies because she downloaded some that you had to pay for!
This tablet was bought for my 4 year old. She uses it to learn.
"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
She loves it. She is 20 months old and already has command of it. Micky and Minnie rule it!
This is what I needed not fancy just simply used for reading books. Easy to use and battery lasts for quite a while.
"Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he's 4, he loves it."
Excellent Amazon fire HD for kids. Perfect for a holiday gift
For the price this is a great investment. With amazon prime it becomes loads of fun
I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful!
My sons love playing on their tablet. Not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided.
This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five.
It was easy to set up. My grandson has enjoyed the broad selection of activities from which to choose.
"I bought this for my grand daughter, she previously had a Nabi. I like the fact that she can use the hot spot on our phones and she can log on to view her favorite shows.My grand daughter is seven, but she also looks at movies and programs that her one year old brother can enjoy. The tablet is light enough to take along any where. It also has a protective shell which is a plus when you have an active seven year old."
This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set
My wife loves this e-reader. It's light weight and and ebooks loads quickly from the Amazon account.
"My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
"Got 2 of these for my two oldest daughters, 5 and 3. Perfect for them and love the features. Battery life seems pretty long. The year of freetime plus the case makes it worth it! Will be getting another for my 3rd daughter's 2nd birthday."
"I always wanted one of those, but they were too expensive compared to a tablet. But now I am loving it!"
My daughter absolutely loves this! It is very user friendly. My only issue with it would be that it doesn't come with a camera automatically installed.
Excellent gift for my grandkids. They love it and play with it all the time.
Proved to be an excellent Christmas gift for both grandkids. They love it
"Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit"
"I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also."
My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer
My Grandson uses it all the time. It was a great choice!
"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip."
My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present
My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.
I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance.
I have bought this for my niece. She loves reading the story books in the Kindle. I am happy to gift this.
I've been using a Kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one as a Birthday present. Very excited recipient!
"It is so easy to use it is super light, and makes a book to read with no effort at all!"
the product is working perfectly and the service was greatThank you
We bought it on a bunch and we're very pleased with the ease of use and the way our granddaughter was motivated to use it.
"My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
This is a great quality reader. Print on it is very clear and it is easy to use.
The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.
My son loves this tablet. It is easy for him to navigate and extremely durable.
I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.
Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!
Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full
My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.
Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.
My kid loves it and is easy to use.Plus the case is worth it.
I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.
I am very happy with this purchase. Keeps my grandsons entertained. Easy to set up and use.
bought for my grand baby for christmas....haven't opened it yet but the other reviews were great!.....i'' sure he'll love it!!....
haven't opened it yet as i bought it for my grand baby for christmas!....i'm sure she'll love it!!!
Everything is great except that i can't read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome!
I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark.
The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
"Use the Kindle apps on Android phones and tablets, but apps don't support family sharing. These Kindles are great (and inexpensive) for that purpose."
Our 5 year old grandson loved it. Bought it for him to play educational games on.
Parental controls are key. My boys can download games within the parameters I set and I get notification of any purchases. 2 year no questions asked replacement is key.
"This Kindle has no extra bells or whistles that would cause major battery drainage. Sometimes less is more. No distractions to keep you from reading, no backlights to fatigue your eyes. Be aware that you can't read this Kindle in the dark.Pretty simple to operate. FYI there is no wall plug adapter for this unit only the USB cord that plugs into the Kindle, and computer for charging. You can buy an adapter separately. If you have the Kindle Fire HDX that adapter works with this kindle. You can use that adapter to charge it from the electrical outlet.I recently purchased this Kindle. I do have had other Kindles, and enjoy them immensely.I purchased this one for outdoor use.So far I Love it!"
This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.
"My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."
In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.
"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up."
This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
Great for kids. The bumper around the tablet has saved it several times. I might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around. The programs are easy to access and love the parental controls.
My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
"The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far."
There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.
"Great for a 2 yr old, and will use it till he's older"
"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
"I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!"
I did some looking in the web and after looking at many tablets this was the best choice.
"This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety."
She loves to be on the tablet all the time . So now she will have her own.
Bought two of these for both of my nieces birthdays and they were the hit of the party. Both love playing with them
My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained
It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet!
I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
Needs to be a way to lock screen. Kiddo loves the device for books and movies on long road trips but accidentally turns off screen or clicks out of it.
"The best device for a child in the market. Purchased for an infant and after two weeks, he is loving it. Easy to handle and durable."
"The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect."
I purchased this as a gift for my grandfather. He was excited when he opened it and will get great use out of it while he is in doors for winter.
I've got this as a gift for my grandmother and she's not tech savvy but she can work a kindle. She loves to read and is very pleased with it.
Was a gift for 7 yr old granddaughter she just loved it one of her favorite item she plays with. It goes with her almost everywhere
"The kids tablet made a good gift for our youngest grandson, 6 years of age."
I bought this as a gift for my smart 1 yr old niece and she loves it. she is always using the tablet. it's her favorite toy.
"Best gift ever, now she leaves mom and dads phones/tablets alone and plays his own, which is also locked down as well. And thanks to the low price, I bought for his siblings as well, there is peace now"
Bought this as a gift so I don't know much about it. Seems nice though
I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
"I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time."
Bought this tablet for my 2 &1/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.
Good to use it to read books under light.the price is lower than other website.
"Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too"
"Good, but unhappy that screen size is small, less than I expected"
Great for toddlers and preschoolers. My 3 yr old loves it
"I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this"
I like it. It is convenient and protect eyes for reading books.
I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.
i would not change any thing on it at all it works very good
It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product..
It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab
"It's so good. You can bring it anyway, anytime. So convenient!"
My daughter love it and is amazing thanks and I will recommend it
The product is very light and thin. But it doesn‚Äôt have built in light.
This is a good Kindle but I miss being able to play games.
"Very light, not feel like an electronics, feel like reading a book. Wish I got the white one."
Reminded my son and I of his old early generation Kindle that worked so well.
Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.
This is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day...you will not be able to read in the dark
my grandson had one and likes it. so i bought it for my other grandson
Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.
"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature
Excellent quality and durability for a young child
"Reader works well in good light, convenient and useful if you like to read"
The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use.
I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased
This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.
My little girl loves this tablet. It keeps her engaged and entertained. It comes with a protective case that protects it from falls and the handlings' of kids. You can download apps and with parental control you are protected from your kids accidentally making unnecessary purchases without your knowledge. Great tablet for kids!
"At first I thought my reader was broken but discovered, by accident, that my touch must be very light."
This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.
I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire
"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it."
This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.
The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading
This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.
He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics
Overall very good product for kid. Much robust and easy to operate.Only downside is that it is sometimes very slow.
Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it was a good buyShock proof and great educational apps for kids in it
Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that
I like that you can set parental setting so the kids can't purchase without you knowing about it. Great warranty also as a separated for the kids and the parents
"my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.
"This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it
I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded
My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one.
My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
"Pretty good tablet. Very durable and my son loves it, keeps him busy lots of game to choose from educational as well"
I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems
"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."
Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient
"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken."
Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.
This was a purchase made for a cruise. I could not see my fire in the sun.
It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good."
"My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!"
Good for toddlersEasy to carryEasy to download
Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast
A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
For two girls that love to play games and take with them
I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.
Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.
Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.
Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
It's a good tablet for kids the only thing I really don't like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok
"Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with."
My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side.
This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps
This was a gift for my girlfriend. She loved due to the fact that it was small and compacted ..
If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.
Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well.
Bought for my son for Christmas and so far he loves it good value for the price.
"I love this kindle, the price is good, not too heavy and I charge once every two weeks"
My daughter loves the device. Only had it a few days
My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.
Nice and convenient just wish that it came with written directions so that I could brighten up the screen.
"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use."
Purchased this for my Down Syndrome sister who enjoy playing games on it.
"UI is not smooth, it flickers sometimes. Overall a thumbs up from me"
Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
"working good, use it everyday, the battary is good also."
My nephew is going to high school and the kindle is a great gift for him. Bestbuy has good selection and the price is good too!
"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
As per me this is a product to protect your eyes while reading.
"I have had 4 other e Readers prior to this one. This one is BY FAR my favorite. It is so easy to use, it is super light, and makes a book worm like me able to read with no effort at all!"
"It works great. I have three kindles right now. Best Buy is good place to buy the product, as it is guaranteed you get the lowest price."
"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model."
"This is my first e-reader. I like it so far. Easy to use interface. The ads can be kind of annoying, but keeps cost lower."
"This is the perfect reader. Price is great, it's easy on your eyes. Battery lasts longer than a tablet."
"This was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party e-reader. It is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. The Kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. The one draw back for some people may be that the lock-screen has ads. This is only on the lock-screen, the ads don't appear while using the device and Amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee."
Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times.
This was purchased as a replacement for one that was dropped one to many times. Hope this one lasts as long and stands up to the abuse the first one endured.
I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps
So read reviews on a few tablets but honeatly felt this was the one for my kids bought it and sure enough it was it best apps for kids especially reading for kids amazon did a good deal on this and if you have prime it links up with your account for videos too
It's a great tablet for a destructive 10 year old. It's still going strong for 2 months now
My grandkids love's it always on it great learning tool
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb - Pink is a great tablet
This is a great little kids tablet. Has a lot of features and is really fun to use.
This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!
"This tablet has served it's purpose, it keeps my little one entertained with age appropriate sites and apps."
My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It's friendly and easy to use.
Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.
"Good tablet for kids, only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire"
Good tablet for kids. Easy to use and kid friendly
Good tablet for younger kids as it keeps them occupied in many ways.and great learning tool.
"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books."
"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!"
My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!
My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.
Overall good tablet for kids. My 6 and 3 year olds both enjoy it. Battery doesn't last anywhere near 7 hours though.
This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.
Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..
My kids have really enjoyed this tablet. This makes car rides a lot easier. They both can create and learn and they love the camera.
Grandkids loved the tablets and they seem very durable and long-lasting
"I am very happy with my e-reader. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. she has one as well, and we use them to read every night as required by her 4th grade class curriculum."
"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
I ordered the extra case not knowing the device came with a case.
Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."
It is very good. I like it. I will buy more items on bestbuy.com.
"Bought this for my 4 years old granddaughter and she loves it. It has all the books, apps, videos that she needs to learn and play. I love it cause she plays on it and leaves mine alone ‚ò∫. It has everything on it and I can set parental guides. Best buy ever! !"
This was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it.
Great learning tool for the grand kids. Helps with there homework.
"Got this for my grand niece, she loves it. Can't beat it for the price."
Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience !
granddaughter loves it! Now my Ipad if free for ME to use
They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom!
Purchased for the grandkids to use while they are visiting. They never seem to get bored.Tip. Make sure you have it password protected or you may find a rapid run up in charges!
Great tablet for young children. Parental locks so you can control what they see. A great deal of educational apps.
"The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe."
We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. They are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. The 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. The one con is that you don't get google play store.
"I PURCHASED TWO FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE AND THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEM, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY! I NEED TO BUY HEAD PHONES NEXT!"
I love the the Kindles!! Bought this for my grandson. Impressed with the 2 years no questions asked warranty.
"alot of great free educational gaming, reasonable price only downfall is sometimes it runs a tad slower than a tablet"
I love the fact that it can take a lick and keeping on ticking my grandson is a bit rough on things.
Bought for my 2 yr old grandson.. and he loves it has a lot of learning numbers alphabet and shapes
My Grandson uses this just about every night. It was a great purchase and we're glad we made it.
"This is the fourth one of these that I have purchased. My grand children love them. Between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, I don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. Excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at."
Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids
"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,"
I love the learning games that he doesn't even realize they are learning games
My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.
Absolute best for kids. Bought three for ages toddler to teen and it's perfect for each.
Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much
Got this the another day for my niece and she loves everything it has to offer
"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun."
"Great for the grandkids, they know how to manage them better than I do."
Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access.
"Great for the kids, and has a good battery for how much they use it"
Great learning tool. Kids love it and so do I. So fun to share time with the kids laughing while learning.
Great price great product would recommend this gift
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great. Great quality. It's like reading a real book
Great..I love it..Glad I got it..My nephew loves it.
Great.I love it..Im glad I got it..My nephew loves it.
Haven't had any issues until recently my son's tablet won't charge anymore. Called geek support but they couldn't locate warranty so I'll have to go in
"he loved it was a great gift easy to use, small and great"
I am very satisfied with my purchase my girlfriend is very happy
I bought these tablets for my niece and nephew who are only 2 and 3 and they love it. My niece who's only 3 has shown my mother a few things. Great products
I can listen to music during my bath. Also there are 39 games I can play and 40 I can't play yet. I am six.
I got this for my mom as a gift and she loved it. Great gift
"I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome"
"Is great kindle , very simple and working good. Oss"
My 4 year old daughter loved it. Also for my 2 year old baby
My daughters love it it is probably one of the best tablets ive ever bought
my kids love the kids fire they use it every single day. its durable.. I can put parental control on certain things.. great buy
My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.
"My son is crazy about it,nice size,good grafics,and Internet conection!"
My son love it. He watch his favorite cartoon shows and love to read books
My son loves it. It is easy for him to use. He doesn't want to put it down.
My son loves it. The picture and quality is great and my so loves all the apps from the characters he loves
"Nice deal, and good stuff. will recommend to others if same deal"
Omg this product is excelent good batery and HD screen love this
"Purchased for my grandson, he loves it. Purchased a blue cover for him"
"She loves it, plays with it everyday all day. Thanks"
This is a great amazon fire tablet for kids highly recommend
"This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps"
This is the second kindle my daughter has been using and its been good.
Very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it
We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.
working well and very cheap if we think in the price way
"This is a great product, my 8yr son is completely hooked onto it. The only change I would say it making the interface a little easier to use."
interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.
If you are into reading then this is for you. I didn't think the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room. Great for reading outside.
I had a normal Kindle before. This works as expected.
"Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features."
Purchased these for our grandchildren ... great for children learning to use electronics.
My 1 year old loves his tablet. He knows how to utilize it very well. It needs a better camera.
My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I'd highly recommend this product
"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"
"The Amazon Kindle is a series of e-readers designed and marketed by Amazon. Amazon Kindle devices enable users to browse, buy, download, and read e-books, newspapers, magazines and other digital media via wireless networking to the Kindle Store."
The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
"Bought this for my 3 kids aged 9,7,and 2. They all use it with ease. They each have their own account with appropriate games. We like the protective cover that absorbs drops and falls well."
Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.
"Great tablets, prefer over the Nabi anyday. Love the color choices"
"My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music."
Purchased for our 3 year old grandson. He loves it.
"This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly."
"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light."
I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.
My daughter love it she don't really brother me it keep her so busy
This tablet is very easy to use i bought it for my nephew and he's only 4 years old and he love it
Great camera for a beginner very easy to understand
My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
The grandson likes the learning games that are on the tablet. You can see the progress in his learning from the time he has used it
"We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!"
My 3yr old just loves it keeps her occupied for hours
If you want to read anytime where there's a light source this is thereafter for you. If you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper considering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model.
Bought for my 3 year old. Very rugged and easy to use. Love it uses the android apps and kiddo loves it.
Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.
"I purchased this as a replacement for my older Kindle. It is excellent as always but I also noticed very little new features or updates since my last Kindle model. Would have liked some more design, form factor, or feature changes. That being said, it fits the bill and is amazingly light, so I have no other complaints."
"My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it."
I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks
Device size and speed are more than adequate for an 8 year old. I love Freetime and the ability to set limits for weekdays and weekends so my grandson is able to play without my direct supervision. Apps and books are age appropriate. I may have to buy 2 more for the 4 year olds.
"My children loved it, and it is great learning tool."
I like it so and so my kids like it very much.The application is amazing.
"I bought this device recently for my daughter, she likes it very much. She learning new things. I also gifted this device to my friends Son."
"Bought 3 for my young grandkids exceptional security for kids, great babysitter as well as educational tool"
"I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase."
This device provides necessary app and is extremely user friendly.
Great way to read books available for downloads from the library
Kindle just keeps getting better. This device is the perfect size to pack away for a business trip to kill some time reading a book or even uploading your documents to access them quickly.
No backlight turns out to be no big deal. It's so light and comfortable to hold.
"We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. The kids love it and it is simple to use. The ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. We can switch to our profile to watch Netflix or use other apps if we want. Comes with a great warranty and device protector. We're very happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet."
"Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use."
"Very nice and easy to use. I bought 2 of these for my granddaughters and they both love them!! Great price, great product!"
"i don't use this e-reader often, only for e-books from amazon, with the student discount, definitely worth the price."
This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.
"Took some time to get use to the Kindle Reader (use to the IPad), but I like that I can read without distractions."
Works great for reading books in the park or in the back yard.
I had read reviews. It is just like what reviews said. It is really good. I still have to try some features. Probably I should have gone for Kindle Light. Maybe next time. But for now I am totally satisfied.
"Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device"
"Super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, I've tried many e-readers but I'll definitely stick to this one."
My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy
Great way to get kids introduced to using a tablet. A ton of free software is available. Guarantee seals the deal.
"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent."
Bought for my granddaughter she loves it. She is starting her first series
"What is there to say, but that I love it. Functions well, and lasts a long time."
"My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his"
"Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks"
Everything he needs but nothing more. The case looked a little flimsy but it has been great so far.
"Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day."
"This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time."
"I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that."
"Great tablet for a little kid. I was debating between this and an ipad but figured an ipad would be way too much for a tablet. Its nice because you can switch users. If you want something simple , then this is the one for you."
"Very easy for my child to navigate. It was very easy to set it up. All the games, books and internet that's pre-loaded is awesome and so convenient"
"I bought this for my 6yr-old & am impressed w/the 1yr subscription to free-time that was included, and the additional 2yr manufacturer warranty. The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!"
"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!"
I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. She loves the number of books she is able to access. It wasd a Christmas hit!
Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
Perfect for price and purpose. I bought this for my 19 month old granddaughter to watch videos and listen to songs on instead of using parents iPhone. When she is older she will be able to play games. Perfect size for her to hold. Love guarantee
we brought this tablet for our 6 yr old for Xmas and she loves it!. it was the go to tablet as she was always playing on my fire tablet... recommend for kids
Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.
"Easy to use, handle and screen is perfect for a toddler."
Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
Very durable and easy to use. Last for several years with all that it can do.
"Thought this would be too advanced for my 3 year old, but she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and learn patience. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept her honest."
"Thought this would be too bland for an 8 year old, but he loves it. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept him honest."
Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend
Extremely satisfied with the value and performance of the Fire kids edition; highly recommend for age 5 and up.
"Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs"
My daughter absolutely love her tablet and I love it to for her. It's very kids friendly
My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money
This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.
It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!
As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.
My son and i use the tablet everyday 2 times morning and night and theres so much to do on it.
my grand daughter and grand son love to play games on their kindles plus their mother put programs on there so they can learn

I bought this for my 13 year old niece who has autism and she loves it. Great price and great tablet for kids.
"I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. In the end it's a great deal."
I bought this for my Don's second birthday and he loves it. My five yr old loves it also. Very easy to use.

"This is great for kids, it grows up with them, all the apps are good. My kid loves it"
This tablet is great for kids. It has so many apps and videos that can be downloaded. It has a nice size screen as well. The only thing I don't like is the charger.
"This tablet is great for trips. Just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have Internet. The case is great for kids who are rough with technology, it really takes a beating."
This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps!
This was easy to setup and easy to hand over to my 4 yr old. She loves the different games and apps that are available to her.

Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids

Would definitely recommend to family and friends that have little kids great learning tablet
Worked great ..... it entertained my 2 year old just great.
This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!
"My kids love this product, as do I. Parental restrictions can be set and they know when they have to shut them off. Good battery life too."

I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
"lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!"
I am so glad I got my son (5 1/2 years old) the Fire Kids Edition Tablet! It is extremely durable & provides hours of educational entertaining fun!!!
It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.
Bought it for my 8 year old and it was perfect. She loves it and works it with ease.
My grand daughter loved it. She plays with it all the time.
Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
Bought this for my three year old when I bought a new car with no tv in it. She loves that I can download shows and movies and then watch others on wifi.
"Works great, easy to use for my 4 year old. I can adjust settings easily. Easy set up"
"My 4 yr old is fully capable of navigating to her favorite games, videos, photos, etc. I like the bumper case too. It has proved its worth already."
She has dropped it a few times and the case is just great
"Was thinking of getting my 5 year old her own Ipad or the kindle. I'm so glad that I picked the kindle, it comes with a kids version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate games, movies, and apps, even though she can't read yet. She loves it too!"
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it
"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"
I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.
My daughter who is two loves it. She colors and dose puzzles
Highly impressed with my purchase. Allows me to use my iPad again since my 3 years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet. Great support and numerous educational apps for children!
My grandkids love it. They use it at home and when we travel.
My grandkids love to use it. It has so much for them to choose and they learn too.
Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account
My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.
"I love to read but don't have the space to keep a collection of books. For me, this Kindle is the best of both worlds. I can enjoy reading a good book without having to find shelf space to store it later."
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her
This product is a great learning tool for my 4yr old toddler. It's has the option for kid mode or regular tablet mode.
This is really very comfortable and easy as well as strong for toddler my baby really enjoy using this amazon fire kids
This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!
"We are super happy with the kindle fire. We had bought several DVD players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. Now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read. It also doubles as a tablet for me since it gives the options for different profiles. We love it!"
"Perfect for our young daughter, its a perfect size and she can use it very easily."
Very easy to use and with amazon have loads of books to access
It very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or
i liked t because its not harmful to my eye like the monitor or the mobile its the best choice for reading
"i love my kindle ..i read on a plane or at the pool, works in different lighting and angles"
"I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers."
Love not having to carry books and being able to get a variety of books.
I am totally happy with this product for my two year old grandson..he enjoys it when we are all playing on our phones
Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive
Good for smaller kids that cannot play or get to play on Xbox games with 7 other Siblings
Great for smaller kids who are Too young to play or get a turn to play on Xbox games with 7 siblings
My daughter loves it keeps the kids occupied. I would recommend to anyone with kids
Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone whit kids
Great tablet for the kids as it includes some good educational apps and has a good case that surrounds it for durability.
My son loves his own kindle! Very kid friendly and easy for him to use. It is great that he now has his own!
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did."
First kindle debated between this one I got and the back lit version. Very pleased It's compact easy to tote. Using at the beech this week. I have Amazon prime so I get free downloads on books . It is easy to use . I think I would definitely recommend this product to others.
"Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week."
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!
Purchased for toddler to watch movies and stuff. He loves the apps that are available.
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
Just purchased as a Christmas gift for my glambaby & she loves it !!!! Very nice case for little clumsy & at times rough hands!!!
My son is 22 months and he love it. He watches his favorite shows.
"Perfect..grandson, age 16 months, just loves it! No worries if dropped."
Very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use.
Absolutely love Kindle Kids Edition. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids.
My nephew always uses my sister's iphone when watching videos. He loves his youtube videos lol. So I went out and bought him this. The kid loves it. There's value in the cartoon membership also
This tablet has been great for my three year old. Only complaint is that you can't turn off the app download function on free time or see a complete list of what has been downloaded.
It's a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level.
"Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me."
My son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and I can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc.. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.
The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.
"Durable case, easy to use. My grandkids watch nursery rhymes and play educational games. I've seen the youngest stand on the Fire and it is still perfect"
This tablet is the best for kids. Switching from kids to adult is awesome! Works perfect and has lots and lots of apps for kids
My three year old son love it. He can read and learn so much from the free time app.
My kids love their tablets. They play games and take pictures.
Great tablet for a toddler to start on! The parental controls can be fiddled with a little bit but good anyways!
A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use!
I bought this for my son's girlfriend as a gift. She really likes it and has positive words.
Purchase it for my granddaughter and she love it many great children's app for learning
Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.
Bought for my granddaughter age 5 for Xmas. She loves it.
"I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers!"
I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money
"They both love it! And, play or read all they can."
The Amazon Kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. The lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. Great product for your money!!
The Amazon Kindle is a great device to enjoy reading before bed. The device is small and lightweight which is better than holding onto a heavier tablet.
I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.
I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.
Needed something for Christmas for five year old grandaughter. This hit the spot.
Nice reading at great price love this reader.like a lot. And Best Buy make happens. Thanks Best Buy
This is a great entry level book viewer. Highly recommend.
The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.
"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase."
I highly recommend this product for children with special needs
Great gift for the price. Brought for 2 year old grandson.
Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.
Very easy for a child to be able to use and enjoy.
I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.
My nephew love it. He uses it every day thank you.
This has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed.
This tablet has grt performance and good camera and long backup. 2 year warranty make lifw more easy for parent's.
"My 3 year old is learning so much playing the games on this tablet, and I love that it is so durable and can take a beating. Would recommend. Many games to match many age groups. Plus YouTube access."
Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet
I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint
"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful."
"I bought this tablet for my 5-year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. It's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games."
I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
"I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"
love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price"
My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was
My kids really enjoyed this tablet. Its kid friendly...
This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.
"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer.
easy to use and has enough space. I highly recommend this product. Also a great gift
Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend
My wife likes it because she can read all different kind of books
I like the fact that there is parental control plus by putting your child's age the kindle will only send you games that are designed for your child's age
Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person
My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!
This is a great kindle for kids to use as it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down.
"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle."
I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing 1 for another grandchild in October. They love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them.
I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
my granddaughter has learned a lot of educational things on hers
This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.
This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!
"Wasn't a fan of having to get one of these (I'm kinda old school...I like book) but, it really was a nice device. Easy to use and read from. Glad I got it!"
I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.
"I purchased this for my youngest grandson, age 4 for christmas and he will be receiving it shortly. Games have been downloaded and it will be charged and ready to use when he opens his gift."
"This was purchased for my older grandson, age 6, for Christmas and as I stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him."
"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars."
Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer
This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
My grandson used my old I Phone to play on. Got him this tablet and he loves it! Great deal!
I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
"I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!"
Bought for my 3 year old and she loves it! Haven't had any issues!
Bought this item for my 1 yr old and at first would not pay attention to it since he loves to run around. But when we are out its a good tablet for a kid and very durable since kids tend to drop toys. We use it to watch movies and even kid educational apps. It's a good buy for the price and to entertain the kids. Video quality is very good.
Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features
Easy for kids to use. Keeps them entertained for hours. Love it!
Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.
Easy to read and maneuver. Just the right size. Well worth it.
easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS
Exactly what I needed for my hand daughter. She loves it and leaves mine alone.
Excellent base model e-reader. Nice to use inside or outside.
Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price
great for the kids and protection is good ! and best buy is making me write more stuff here so that people can go ahead and buy this product...
Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.
Great product easy to set up and use my child loves it
I bought 1 a year ago for our oldest kid. Came back this year and bought two more. Built really well. This is the best choice for a kids tablet.
"I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. Her only disappointment is that she is unable to access the ""Musicality"" app."
"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle."
I purchased for my 7 yr old grandson to use for playing games. He is very happy with it. It appears to be a good buy .
It was the best Christmas Present for my grandson.
"It's beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though."
Keeps the kids busy with games and activities and they really like it
Kids love playing with it. We use it for netflix and for basic games
Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!!
My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!
"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
My gf loved it and uses it all the time. She gets books she wanted to follow up on
My grandson loves it and there are lots of educational games .
My kids loved and i very happy for this tablet. Thanks
"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader."
Such a great product. I like that it is very small and fit in my purse. I like that the battery last for a very long time.
The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again
This e-reader meets all expectations and has a good feel to it.
Very easy basic e book reader. Good for beginners to start
We love the free time feature. Definitely going to end up subscribing after the free year trial is up. Our 2 year old loves it and we can control how long she's on it.
Great product and great service from bestbuy online
Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good
I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.
got this product for my granddaughter. im #1 grandma now
This is for my 5 year old and she hasn't put it down since Christmas. She uses it for watching videos and taking pictures of her toys..
The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.
This tablet is great for kids. I bought it for my Grandson and he is delighted with it. He uses it constantly.
Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse.
I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.
"Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it."
No suprises here. I have owned the 7th generation Kindle before and the 8th generation came as a lighter and better upgrade to the version. Great functionality and awesome reading experience.
"My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use."
Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.
This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!
Good age appropriate learning tool for kids. There is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored. Overall a good tablet for the kids.
It is just like reading a book only it's way more convenient! The background has the same look as the pages of a real book.
We recently purchased this as a gift for charity. We chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and couldn't be more please. It's very easy set up and super user friendly. I would def. recommend this for a child rather than a more expensive product.
We recently purchased this exact tablet for our daughter who is 2 years old and decided to purchase this tablet for a charitable gift at Christmas. I would recommend this rather than more expensive tablet options for a child. it is worth the money and very user friendly.
"My wife and I bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help keep her entertained during car rides, etc.. well now she is completed addicted to it. I guess like many kids get addicted to their electronics. We just set limits to how often and when she can use it. There are also educational games and apps you can down load that help them to learn and prepare for school. My daughter loves playing these games also. Overall a great purchase."
Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them!
Got this on sale for a great price and is a great product.
"I like this ereader. It is a little small, but you can increase the font."
"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet."
Good product for child. Who only need to read the books
I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.
my son loves it. I have bought him tablets before but he never liked them as much. this one is easier to use.
"I love how compact this kindle is, I'm able to put it in my gym bag, backpack, and my purse. The screen is a plain white which is great for reading because you don't get a glare, I just wish Best Buy offered a case for it I had to purchase one from amazon."
"What can I say, if you enjoy books and magazines it's hard to beat. Not backlit but not an issue for me. I take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much."
I feel that this tablet was the perfect fit for my boys age 8 and 6.
My granddaughter is enjoying it thoroughly. My son likes the various parental controls
"Great starter to teach young children how to play games with parental control of what game,movie or music sites. And the plastic protector case is included"
Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.
"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
"I bought this tablet for my granddaughter. She loves it, it's easy for her to use, and just right for her size."
"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."
Plan to buy a second a second Amazon Kindle for a hi e year old.
Bought this for a 8 yr old and its perfect for what she like to do
We gave this tablet to our nine year old Grandaughter for her birthday. She loves it and we feel it is very sturdy. That is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children.
Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.
Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it
Bought this for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it good learning tool along with great fun for him!
Bought this for my two yr old and she loves it not to mention super durable.
Excellent tablet.....withstands a special needs Grandson.
Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.
Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids
Great tablet for a great price. Timely & free shipping
"Great tablet for the girls, they love it. Easy to use and great with amazon prime."
"Great tablet for the grandkids, they love it great item"

"Kids loved these tablets, and in not worried about them dropping them"
"My daughter has been wanting one for quite sometime! I love the durability, and that I can set limits to what she does!!"
"MY DAUTHER LOVES THIS TABLET, IS EXCELLENT FOR A 3 YEARS OLD CHILDREN"

My granddaughter loves her tablet toddler friendly
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Best tablet for the money.
My granddaughter loves this tablet. It's the perfect gift for a 2 year old
"My son is fascinated with this tablet, and iam too."
"My son loves it! So many great games, audiobooks and apps for kids, and we love the timer feature so we can set time for him to let him play before bedtime. Very worth it!"
Only wish games worked without internet once downloaded
The kids love it and are always on it. Would recommend to anyone.
This is one of the best kids tablets I have purchased. It's not as restricted and complicated to operate as other tablets I have tested.
"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100"
"We have dropped it a few times and the case is great. There is a ton of memory, great price. And how did I never know about Amazon underground. It's a great product and great price. I definitely recommend"
"I bough this for my daughter and it's perfect for her little tiny hands, I just wish that the screen would lock when she is watching her shows because she gets excited and touches the screen and it pauses or chances the show or it goes to other apps. Overall it's a great product for a small child"
I liked it so much I will e getting all my grandkids one for birthdays from now on.
We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.
I'm very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it.
I absolutely love the parental controls on this device. You can even set a time limit on how long they can use it.
Bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality. The case protects it well.
"We bought this for our 7 year old and at first we had some issues loading things, but things seem to be working great now. He loves it and he can play games and load apps. Just what we wanted it for."
This tablet was for my great-grandson and he loved it
He loves his kindle takes it everywhere. does school work on it plus plays games Excellent piece of equipment.
I love this tablet i got it for my grandson and the minute he comes through the door he wants his tablet it keeps him busy
My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe
This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.
This met my expectations and more. My granddaughter loves it. It's user friendly and has unlimited options for her. Would recommend to everyone!
It's an excellent learning tablet for a child. I would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.
Got this for my Grandson's birthday. He really wanted a tablet and I wanted something that wasn't so breakable. He was so excited and he loves it
This is a great tablet for a kid! It is easy to use and play on!
My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
Bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it! The child case is awesome too in case of any drops.
"Love this tablet! Highly recommended, especially for a toddler who's learning. Has lots of games and activities for learning, parental controls, which I find extremely necessary for the internet today!"
"My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this ""big game"" as he calls it."
Very pleased with product. I was also a decent price and not overpriced.
We bought this for our 2 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! It has so many apps and videos for her to watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child.
I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.
My six year old turned this tablet on immediately on Christmas Day. He knew how to operate it easily.
Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
"I would recommend this to all of our friends and family. It's worth every penny. Good warranty, comes with a free subscription, works quickly and is very durable!"
Keeps my kids busy for hours the apps are excellent
I bought the tablet for my 2 year old as a birthday present. I downloaded the apps I thought he would enjoy and handed it to him. He caught on to some really quick while others hes still a little young. Overall the quality and durability is excellent.
my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the books for school & screen size is prefect
This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old.
Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.
This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.
Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. She would use her Mom's phone to watch her shows but now that she has her tablet she can watch her own and see it much better. Homerun on this Christmas present!
Easy to maneuver. And great case for protection. The battery does not keep a charge long but I'm used to the iPad.
"I purchased two of these tablets, one for my niece, one for my nephew, as they are often fighting over the tablet. It is a great platform, with awesome apps, and comes equipped with a very sturdy and rugged case. Five stars. Worth every penny."
It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.
My 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it's great
"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made ."
Nice product . Love the fact that my 5 years sons are gaining computer experiance.
we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them these are the best tablets on the market they have great learning apps on them aswell
"What I really like is that you can set up different profiles( boy,girl and myself ) and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile.I bought 2 and kids are very happy."
Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it.
Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom. I thought I saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if I find this to be true. Would hate to be charged for what the kindle was intended for.
My 5 and 8 year olds love these tablets. They are able to play age appropriate content. Tablet seems well powered and the case is providing good protection.
My daughter loves the games/videos that she can watch on it during the day and my wife uses it to read on during the evening. This thing gets used a lot! Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
Bought one last year that worked out well. Decided to get another one this year. Very pleased.
Excellent tablet for my grandkids. Durable. Awsome 2 year free replacement if damaged for any reason
Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!
"Bought this for my Granddaughter, she absolutely loves it!"
First time using Amazon Fire programming. So far my child and I love the apps and programs. I really love the parental limits and time limits I can set. And that I can set learning and reading limits before play.
Great for my 7 year old she loves it!!! Great price and great product!!!
"Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps."
Great tablet for kids my boys love their tablets!!
"Great tablet, kids love it and have their own. Easy to use"
Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.
Holds charge well. Portable. Lightweight and as best we can tell nearly indestructible. Perfect for kids
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 4YR OLD. WE HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET AS IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. FROM WHAT I READ THIS WILL DO THE JOB FOR HIM. THE PRICE AND COLOR WAS GREAT.
I bought this item for my 9 year old son. He loves it and it has nice feaures such as parental controls.
I bought this product for my grandchildren. It is very easy for them to use and sturdy enough not to break when they drop it.
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view.
I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn't work any more.
"I really love this tablet for my toddler! The only things I have against it are that there is no kickstand on it, it may lag at times, and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie can't be exited. Other than that it's a great tablet."
It is a nice tablet for kids and my son enjoys it.
It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
It's a great beginner tablet for kids allows you to ensure your kids are viewing and playing contents for their age.
My 3yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet! Now she can watch Mickey Clubhouse whenever she wants.
My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books
My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.
My granddaughter loves her pink tablet she is four and able to use on her own
My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight
My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.
Our 4 grand kids use these daily charge after charge sometimes .youngest is almost 3 oldest is 9 Just watch the charging cable connection easily broken if charging while using
Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!
This is a good tablet for kids and comes with a good warranty
This is a great tablet for kids. Its got great parental controls and its easy for the kids to use. I even enjoy playing angry birds on it
"We bought the kindle fire to replace a broken iPad 2, which was now out of date for any further updates. I love the parental controls. The case has been a savior for a few drops. My daughter loves the size of the tablet. The 2 year replacement plan and 1 year unlimited FreeSpace makes this the perfect tablet for my child. She loves that she doesn't have to ask everytime she wants a new game or video. We chose to expand the memory up to 128gb with a microsd and so no worries about running out of storage space! My only complaint is that the battery life isn't anywhere near the power of an iPad. So keep your charger with you!"
We decided to buy the tablet so our toddler could play educational games on hers instead of going for my iPad. I love how we can block her from going on the Internet as well as set a curfew. It's easy to use and my daughter loves it!
Kindle Fire meets the needs of kids and/or adults-
"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
Bought one of these for each of my grandkids and they love it!
"I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!"
"I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue. They was for my 5 and 7 years children. They really love their tablets. Yes, it was a birthday gift."
Love this tablet! It's easy to setup and the pre-loaded games were a hit with my little one! Very pleased with the the selection of videos and games on Amazon Kid Play :)
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Love the fact that it has a two year warranty against breakage and also comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time.
We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.
I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. It's easy to use and the perfect size for his hands.
My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to
My daughter loves it. So easy to set up. And keeps everything age appropriate.
This kids fire tablet is perfect for our 5 year old granddaughter. We downloaded some free and purchase kids apps. It give us a break as she's not always asking for our tablet. And we know the content on it is safe.
This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.
"Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love!"
"This is the second tablet I've purchased aimed for little ones and it's by far the best. Easy to access his games and plenty of preloaded games, videos and apps. It makes road trips so much happier!"
I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden
"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint."
Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.
Easy to navigate. Color is good. Duarable. My son has had many fun hours playing with it
"Love the case, table works very well, easy to download game and apps, but the life of the battery is not great. The battery fully charged only last about 3-4 hours"
Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers.
"This is a great tablet for my 3 year old grandson. The cover is great in that, if he drops it, it won't break! Great buy"
My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes.
Tablet is great! I bought it for my 6 year old daughter again (first one finally got the screen cracked) for Christmas and she and i love it. It has all the features you would expect from an android tablet but with nice parenting aspects to keep the kids where they should be.
Excellent product thanks !Thanks for the help choosing what I was looking for and all the variety of apps that are available on this one.
"My niece is 2 years old and she absolutely loves this tablet. It's easy for her to use and navigate through. Plus, it has parental controls which I love. Definitely recommend it."
This tablet is just the right size for my son's hands. Easy for him to use
Brought this for my daughter and it's been a life saver!!! I love that it already comes with the pink bumper it's perfect for her!! Set up was also a breeze!!! I'm very pleased with this purchase.
We purchased three of these tablets for our granddaughters and they use them everyday and enjoy them. We spoke with one of the Best Buy associates and he was great telling us about this product. Made our decision easy. Thanks.
My kids are on their tablets for hours on end. I was able to download several preschool apps for them. They actually are learning very well. The tablet us simple to use and they can navigate themselves on the tablet very easily.
I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA
My son loves the tablet. I like that Amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two years
Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!"
My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
My 3yo loves it and never wants to put it down. Lots of preloaded educational games and videos!
"My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it."
Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
Purchased this item after another tablet stopped working in less than a year of having. Couldn't go wrong with the two year no worry gurantee and the one year free subscription of Amazon FreeTime. Have had for about a month and it was been well worth the money already.
I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.
This tablet is perfect for a young child. The case it comes with is wonderful and seems very protective.
This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.
Great for kids its durable and lets them play games etc.. so they leave our cell phones alone LOL
"I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8."
I love this tablet. I got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it.
This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.
The child that this item was purchased for hasn't put it down. He is really enjoying it!
"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead"
"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos
I bought this tablet for my 1 year old and he loves it! It keeps him entertained when we go places and he has learned so much. The apps are great and perfect for him. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet.
This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.
I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily.
This tablet is great for a child. It will stand up to accidental drops and has just enough expandability for future use. I give it 5 star!
"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
I bought 2 of these tablets for my Grandsons that both have Autism. They can be very hard on things and this is 1 tablet neither boy has been able to break yet. they are very easy for them to use and they LOVE them. The only thing with them is you need an Amazon account for them.
This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.
I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
great the kids love it for learning on and great on long trips
The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.
Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
"Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up"
I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update."
"I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it."
I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!
This little device is great for it price. Lots of features.
The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.
"This Kindle is great value for what it is. You'll need to treat it like normally would with a standard book in regards to reading environments. There is no light, so you'll need to read in a well lit room and can be read easily in the sun.Goodreads is automatically on there so I can log my books while and after reading. Syncing with Amazon is seemless and easy to purchase through the website or loan through my local library. The battery is outstanding, and I haven't had to charge it yet! The built in dictionary is awesome for words you come across you don't know. Even upon completion of the book, all your highlighted words are compiled in a list to show how many and what new words you learned from this book! Incredible feature for anyone, especially younger readers!"
"Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing."
This washer and dryer is very basic but still nice with lots of options. Great for my small family. Worth the money!
"Bought these for my 5yr old twin grandkids and the enjoy the learning games so much. Love that you can limit how long child is engaged with apps, games, or movies on this and that my daughter can use her amazon prime acct with this! 2yr amazon warranty is amazing as well"
Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it!
Great! It's very good. I will buy it next time. Thanks.
I love this kindle! It's a life saver when I'm bored at the doctors office!
Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too!
Love it!! My two year old loves to watch Sesame Street & football
Purchased for our niece. She is 6 years old and it's perfect for her. She loves it!
Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.
Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it.
"My other daughter has this same tablet, so I knew it would be a winner with my other child as well."
By far the greatest tablet for kids. Free time is fantastic. I don't have to worry about content for my child. And the two year worry free warranty is in heard of. 2 thumbs up
Great product and reasonable price! Suitable for everyday use
This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe
Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this
It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place...
bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy
Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
Am used to Kindle Fire which I love. No light to read by in the dark. Hard to navigate. This was a gift - would never purchase on my own.
Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product.
He loves it. Helps him learn and teaches him how to count
Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find
After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.
"Bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. She really enjoys it."
So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
This was a huge hit with my seven-year-old grandson. I came in to replace a broken tablet and they were no longer available. So I chose this one and it's better than ever!
I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
"We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too."
I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where
The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case
Brought it for my niece for a Christmas and she loves it doesn't lag or anything it works just fine
I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k
I love it and I brought two more for my Grandson and God Daughter.
I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.
"My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink."
"I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go."
"I bought my Kindle because I heard it was good for reading in direct sunlight. I‚Äôve got a bay window I like to read at and other tablets I‚Äôve read on produce a lot of glare. This has zero glare and I can‚Äôt wait to take it camping this Spring/Summer/Fall. A side note, this is way lighter than any book (as you may have guessed). I like to read on my back and having this has drastically increased the amount of time I can read for."
"Always good for reading books. If you get a good deal, buy it!"
Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend."
"Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!"
It is awesome. Light and easy to use and read. Great price. Was on sale.
"Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school"
I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time.
It was easy to se up but the recipient wished it has an actual manual that you didn't have to download to print a copy. She has yet to use it outside due to weather at this time.
I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.
I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great
The fire kid edition 7 is good but not great. Volume is pretty low. But my son throws it around and it doesn't break. Case is stone hard. I also the the brightness on the screen can be a bit low.
So it is working great. She loves the learning games
I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.
"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that
Definitely a good product children of all ages in elementary school.
"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible."
I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow
volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.
The parental control could be a lot better. It's nice and compact. She loves it
The tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid Apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that Amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other I'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to Apple it will take some getting used to.
I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it
Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
"I wanted a basic reader without a lit screen (I'm looking at computer screens almost all day). This reader fit the bill perfectly; doesn't get hot, long battery life, easy to navigate. I love downloading books from the library now."
"I originally got the lower end Kindle, took it back and upgraded. The light really is a must. I can't believe how much more I'm reading now that I have it, and there are TONS of free books out there if you know where to look. Best. Purchase. EVER."
"Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!"
"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
"My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips."
"This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don't want to do much else"
It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!
Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this.
"We had been using the Nabi for our 3 year old, but after the reviews online about the dreamtab we decided on the amazon fire kids tablet. So far so good. Very easy for our son to navigate without worry about getting on unauthorized websites."
I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!
My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!
Kindle fire is extremely easy to use. The protective foam layer is awesome.
My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages
Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy
My daughter loves her tablet I love free time love the case it came with just right to buy for a kids first tablet
This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.
"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.
Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it
This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!
"Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device."
Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better
Very study tablets. 2 others grands liked theirs. Salesman was very helpful finding 2 different color models
Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets.
Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them
"It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable!"
my grandkids love it. This is the 3 one we bought.
Our grand kids really love this tablet and it has a lot of app options.
"Our kids love it and the Amazon unlimited is fantastic with tons of options. However, our kids still fight over usin our grownup tablet bc the screen is larger."
Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case
My kids love the tablet and it's easy for them to use
"A great little tablet built for kids with access to volumes of free apps for a year, including books, games, etc. It can be easily used by kids of almost any age."
My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!
Works great. Easy to set time limits and goals. Easy to set up multiple profiles. Excellent product. As advertised.
Easy setup nice size only thing is the charger cords need to be more sturdy.
Probably a little too much but the device has excellent parental controls. They have used it for about a week so far with no issues.
easy for my kids - 8 and 11 to use the kindle for night time reading
My kids love these. I purchased 3 of them at one time. They seem really durable.
"My children think these are the greatest. I'm kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank."
A few problems with games loading but over all good
"great tablet for children, lots of content. games books etc and easy for my 4 y.o to use."
"Great, non-expensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my Ipad."
Bought this nice kindle fire kids tablet for my 18 month son for a 6 hour road trip to LA and it did the job. I downloaded some movies and apps from Amazon to keep the little guy busy. He absolutely loved it and best thing is the case it's very durable. Plus with 2 year guarantee if anything happens they'll replace it for free. We both love it!
It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.
This tablet is great for kids my grandson is sick and he absolutely loves it
My 2 yr old loves his tablet. Best purchase ever. It has great educational videos and is easy for him to work on his kids profile. Amazon got it right!
"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it."
"Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics."
"Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product."
Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.
"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me."
Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
Love to rad my books with my kindle and download straight from my device. So easy and safe. Lovit. Thanks Best Buy
My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
This kindle is amazing and better than prior versions.
So simple to set up a caveman could do it and still have time to get some reading in!
We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
"In trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. First I got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon."
Would be lost without my kindle and kindle unlimited spend lots of time reading
it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable. increase the size of the fonts
My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.
I purchased the kindle light because I love to read and needed something that would not die quickly. I also needed something smaller and lighter that could go anywhere with me. I love my purchase and a must have for all book worms.
This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well.
Great for reading. Best part is its light weight and long battery life.
"Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games."
"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"
Need to have better info for special needs children. The kids utube is confusing but love the guarantee
1st kindle screen failed & had to reboot often. Customer Service couldn't fix. Replaced. 2nd one screen reboots often. Customer service offered replace. Just want one that works. Can't get upgrade replacement
My grandbaby loves hers. We gave it as a Christmas present!
Bought it for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. Get purchase!!!
"I am in love with this device. Battery life is amazing, so long as you remember to turn airplane mode on."
It's simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times.
My 6 and 4 year old boys love it and so do the parents
My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.
"My kids love this tablet. There are over hundreds of games, books, and shows to pick from"
"My niece loves this tablet. It's very durable, but charges slow"
The parental controls are amazing! Super easy for my daughter to operate
This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Perfect for a 5 year old
The kindle fire kid is easy enough that our 2 year old can work it!!!
it was very easy to sit up and get it to working and plying games and down loading
Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.
Great for my kiddo! He loves to watch Sesame Street on it :)
I love how portable this Kindle is. It fits right in my purse and makes it so I can read whenever and wherever I have free time.
"I love the parental controls available. You can set what time they can start and stop using, as well as how much time on each activity. Also love the guarantee of replacement."
I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.
I really like my Kindle. The backlight makes it easy to read at night. Highly recommend for someone looking for a simple reader.
"My kids enjoy this tablet, as do I! The only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.Also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken."
Pros: preloaded with everything your kids will need.Cons: need to buy at least 32GB microSD with it.
My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy!
"Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed."
I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts
Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can't Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night.
I bought this one for my mom because I love mine so much
"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work"
It allows me to read without using space in my phone.
"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!"
This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.
haven't opened yet since its a Xmas present for my 2 yr. Old I love that there is a kids zone area where she can learn numbers letters shapes and has nice thick bumpers to keep it from breaking as well has a warranty if it breaks
Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one!
"my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement"
"This is my second kindle. As I travel a lot, I love the ability to get electronic versions of books both through Amazon and my local library."
I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me
"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
Love this kid's tablet - it's kid proof! It's perfect for kids of all ages!
This is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free. It keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning.
"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination"
The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.
Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well
I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month
"Great little lap top with touch screen, absolutely ruins you."
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. We take it everywhere.
Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet
"So far the 1yo loves it. I thought it would be too much, but no."
"I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare."
Always content with best buy and their products. I would definitely recommend.
"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service....."
"Overall good product, bought two for my parents and they loved it!"
Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!
"I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me."
Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM
My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it.
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.
This was a Christmas present for my 3 year old son. He loves having his own 'pad pad'. He sees everyone else with a tablet and can now play age appropriate games and watch his shows without me having to worry.
"My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight."
i have not had any issues with it. i like the separate profiles so i can use it too with out him getting online. plus i can down load a app and if it is suitable for him i can add it to his profile.
This tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.
My 4 year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him!
No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my toddler and she loves it.
"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches
I never have any issues with this company or products!
She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school
this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday
"Excellent tablet for a young child that is very durable, expandable, inexpensive and my grand daughter loves it."
My grandson is very happy with his Kindle. The case protects it very well.
Basically it does everything that adult Amazon tablet does
I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great
Great learning tool and tough exterior makes it the PERFECT gift for a three year old.
It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!
This holds my grandson attention on a regular basis.
He loves his new tablet lots of fun and educational games to choose from and best of all very kid proof he has dropped it numerous times and I see no signs of damage whatsoever
My kid loves it. It's really convenient for us to put educational games on it for him.
I purchased 2 of this Amazon Tablet for my 2 kids - 4 & 3yrs old.They just can't keep there eyes off this they fondly call IPAD.My wife laugh every day when they tell her to recharge their IPAD.
Awesome tablet for young children. They love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it.
"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
I love my new e-reader!! I am enjoying all my books in one place.
I absolutely LOVE my kindle. I go nowhere without it. It has kept me entertained for hours. Don't have to keep up with books that get torn or lost. I would and DO RECOMMEND a kindle for EVERYONE
The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
"This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price."
Love the new Kindle. Priced right. Perfect size. Take it with me everywhere.
"This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'Goggle' info on her phone."
It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.
He loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe
"I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though."
"It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.
My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter
My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.
This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.
"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two."
"I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come"
Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....
Nice for kids. Like the free apps built in the device. Can control what and how long they get to use screen time
"Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight"
Nice alternative for reading kindle books for kids. Not many features but good enough for reading.
"I bought this at a discount, I don‚Äôt think it is well worth the price. Very compact and light"
Nice basic reader. Had the first model kindle and this is quite a bit lighter
Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it
Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.
I had always been looking to upgrade my original Kindle. I love the new touch features and display on this one. The size also makes it very easy to transport.
I purchased this Kindle for my daughter and she really enjoys using it !!
4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.
I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
A great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who likes ti play games and read books.
"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models."
Nice reader. Light weight. Clear display! Portable
I am happy as i bought it for reading and it is good.
"I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone."
Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
"Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own."
"My granddaughter really likes it. ""She"" found age-appropriate games to play."
My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.
The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case
i always buy from best buy. they have excellent products.The workers are very knowledgeable of what they sell.Thanks
This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild
"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
"Small, light easy to read in any lighting. If you are looking for a device that serves one purpose, to read books anywhere, this is for you."
This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me
I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.
"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though"
Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
"It's a great product, I would buy another for a family member. I do hope they lower the price a little in the future"
"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working."
This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.
"I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!"
Picture quality is not good. I don't like this product
"this item is not good ok ...no use for my kids ,,,"
I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.
When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.
Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy
"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son."
My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.
"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
"My first e-reader, and I have been filling it up fast. Great for travel!"
It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!
I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes."
"Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........"
Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!
Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
This tablet has been a great learning tool for my child.
Great buy. Love it.. got this for something to read on the train
"Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it."
The guy at the store was really helpful. There was not a pink Fire Kids Edition so he looked on top of all the shelves and found one. My four year old grand daughter loves it.
"This was perfect for entertaining my 20-month old great grandson during car trips, shopping and bedtime."
"With a great child-proof case, this was the perfect tablet to start my little guy off with!"
This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps!
the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy
I bought this for my son's 7th birthday and he loves it!
I bought this for my toddler and its perfect. He is rough with it and it still works. I wanted something that I use to teach him the basics of using a tablet and this worked great. It comes with a 2 yrs warranty.
I have a 3 year old at home. Best purchase ever! Indestructible. Reliable. Easy to program. I would highly recommend this.
"So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine."
my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!
"Can be dropped, thrown and doesnt break. awesome tablet"
I love this tablet. It's durable and my niece loves it
"My daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books."
"My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well"
"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls
I like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. It has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books."
It's all the great features of the Fire but with added bonuses for the kids. The app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.
Our children tend to forget to get gentle with the kindle so the replacement plan is great. And I don't have to worry about the wrong kind of content popping up. It's a relief.
"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.
Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.
I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.
Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1
These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.
I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.
Leapfrog is a great learning tool for preschoolers and beyond my grandson loves it
Perfect for my grandson I love the easy to use set up and parental control. I have recommended this to my friend for her children. Case is great
This has the all speed and storage I needed for my first grader. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.
"The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows"
"Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them."
purchased for my child to read - works as expected and for the price it was a good option
Great way to read books on the beach. Easy to use and set up. I like the way it syncs your book across all your devices. Very light weight too.
I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.
"I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee."
"I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all."
This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.
"My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands."
"Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself"
I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.
My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.
"I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it."
"Got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! Lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. What really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that Amazon offers!"
Very useful for night time reading responsive and intuitive display
"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied."
"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids."
I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.
This tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. It has lots of fun apps for the kids.
"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.
My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.
I'm enjoying the ease of having several reading options without the bulk.
"I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help."
Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.
I was unable to find a new Kindle in-store and was excited to find Best Buy had them online and I could purchase it and have it delivered simply and easily.
"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store."
"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version."
Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.
"This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus"
"I bought it cause I wanted to read more. That didn't happen, I tried and I just can't read on devices I need old school paper between my hands"
Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .
"Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
"Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
"I really enjoy the basic amazon kindle and best buy had a great deal on it when I purchased it. It's very easy on the eyes and there is no glare when reading outside even on a sunny day just as advertised. It has the look of book in that sense. I was able to order this online and ""pick up in store"" and it was very convenient because I was low on time. I highly recommend this product to any avid reader and anyone looking to make the jump to an eReader. A few other great features are the long battery life, it's light and small and very easy to take on the go."
this item is a great upgrade from my last kindle.everything is touch screen and is faster than before
This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.
she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
"I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
Easy to use and similar to using a book. Love it! I would buy again!
"Great starter eReader, very simply does what it's made to do."
"I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this."
A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops
"After using a series of low end tablets as an e-Reader, I purchased this on sale for $50. It only really does one thing - display Kindle books in normal lighting, but it does it well.Size, feel, and battery life are all good, and unlike LCD-based tablets it is easy to read outside. The Amazon lock-screen ads are not that intrusive, and easy to ignore."
"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls"
Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
Small & without audio but easy to use. Able to connect to Amazon account & Goodreads account easily. The only thing I hate is that I have to keep restarting it if I want to get out of a ebook that I‚Äôm currently reading
"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all..."
"It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
"Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer."
Bought this for a 2 year old. She loves it! She's already got more things figured out on it than I do!. Good educational programs and some fun ones too!
You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
"Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The 'excited factor' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either."
My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome
My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.
"Helps keep my son entertained on long rides, and it's pretty indestructible."
Great purchase for my son's 6th birthday. He love it and the kid account is a great addition
"My two year old loves the videos,games and books this tablet provides."
"My mom is tech illiterate. She had an original Kindle but the screen print bled and made it unusable. Reluctant to a touchscreen device she decided she still wanted it because she ""loves her Kindle"". While it was a bit of a learning curve she still got the hang of it and now she's back to old self and her kindle!"
"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long."
My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!
Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
"This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling."
kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there
It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
We open the box. We download a book. It's like magic. The words the phrases the complete sentences. So cool!!!
Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.
nice and easy-to-use for a 3 yr old ..............
Tablet works pretty good. I purchased it since I was a to make two accounts. One for myself and one for my child. Goo buy!!
The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.
"I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet"
This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.
I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device
Gift for great nephew. Have 2 that are 5 and 6 y/o. Both love these tablets because each got one. Play with them as much as Mom allows.
Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.
"Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift."
"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!
This tablet has great storage capacity. I have downloaded all kinds of children's movies and learning activities. It's great.
My 3yr. old loves this tablet. Easy for her to use. She watches videos plays games.
Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.
Its a good product and also you can be monitoring what can your kids see
"The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better!"
We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.
"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book."
"My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away."
I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.
"My daugther used to have a leap frog tablet, but when it started to have battery issues I went to the store and found out that they no longer produced the tablet, so best buy gave me store credit and they recomended me this tablet. My daugther loves it and so do I. On kidz mode I can rest assured that she is only going to see kids safe content like interactive book, games and apps. On tablet mode she can watch movies with the SD card slot which can go all they way to 128GB!I put a 32 GB which help us on our loooong christmas trip..."
"The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness"
"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
This is the best e-reader around tried all the other models and this by far is the best...
This is more a no-frills Kindle compared to the ones that had keyboards and nicer back-lit features. But it does the job. Make sure to get it on sale.
"My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case."
"Bought for my 2 year old granddaughter l, she loves it, so easy to use .. She can navigate through it with no problems"
"At first I was a bit skeptical about the sensitivity of the touch screen on these new kindles, but it has been great. The reading is very smooth and I am quite please with this purchase."
I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new.
This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.
"My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it."
"I bought the Tablet for my grandson for Christmas. It was the best investment that I have made in all time. He is learning so much that he can't put it down. As a matter of fact, he sleeps this it just about every night."
I purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter after having purchased her older sister one last year when she was 3. It's comforting knowing it has as durable cover to endure the energy of a toddler.
"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet"
We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem."
Touch response is not so good. so my kid refused to play games on this.Returned this product. Thanks to Bestbuy for the full refund
it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark
I lie the size and weight for the kindle-makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format.
It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!
"My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading"
"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!"
Glad that I get to control the time spent on which sure site and apps.
It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on
"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet
Grandkids fight over this. My daughter also uses this. Very good and user friendly. Would buy again.
Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it
"It is small, light, and easy to read. I am in love with it."
Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.
The service was great and the help I received thanks
My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.
"Grandson has loved this since he opened it for his Birthday He was able to use it,figure it out, right away The protective case actually makes it easier for him to handle. Simple to set up for his home internet and parents were able to view and set up controls of their choice."
"Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads"
So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
Love how easy it is for my 9 year old sone to navigate around. The unlimited kindle free time is great too we like that we are able to set time limits as well as only allow age appropriate games and content. Our son Not only loves playing Minecraft and watching netflix on it but enjoys the reading the books as well.
This was a gift to my niece. Her mom liked the parental controls
Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!
We purchased this as a gift and the feedback we have received has been great.
"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality"
There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!"
The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
"It's really a good product to buy for kids. A lot of educational games . They can their favorite kids show from youtube, Netflix etc. The cover is really good. I'm gonna another one for my daughter."
May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained.
Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
Great-----------------------------------------------
I'm very with this kids friendly tablet. My daughter she uses my iPad and I decided to look one perfect for her...two years warrantee.
My grandson loves it. Will be getting another one.
I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding
Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!
"My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it."
"This is a great tablet for kids. Keeps them busy with so much to do, watch, and create."
I bought this for my mom. The type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading !
Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.
"Nice product, great price and expandable storage unlike the HD version"
Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done.
"BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle."
"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it"
"Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty."
Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues
"Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device"
I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
"I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."
I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.
Grandson picked it up & used it right away. He enjoys the tablet.
my son has been using our computer and we got him this and he never looked back.
"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product."
"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it."
"Such a great deal for a small fee, just right for a toddler of three."
I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids
This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
"This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far."
This is a great product. Light weight. I wish it has wifi to download from online.
Works excellent love it. Easy to use
"Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something."
The item seems to have a 'ton' of items to view - just wish it came with some directions on use. Otherwise product is great.
"Love it, had the stick and it was kinda slow navigating. This one is much faster. Was going to use this and cancel cable. When I told my cable company I wanted to cancel and I was just going to stream everything they cut my bundle cost by 100. I kept cable but I also still use my firetv alot."
"This box is wonderful, meets my expectations plus some. I gave up cable and tried it. I don't watch a lot of movies but this box comes with a lot of selections in my opinion more than basic cable, and if you have prime even more selections, theres a lot of free shows just download the apps for them."
"Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :)."
I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.
This has great possibilities for the ARMCHAIR POTATO by expanding what is available to view. I would recommend this to anyone.
Hands down best kindle around this is my third kindle and they are all amazing but this one takes the fake love all the new options on this updated model...
This is a neat little device and I love it. I am glad they added Audible functionality. It is a little pricey for an E-reader... actually very pricey but I got mine as a gift. I wish you didn't have to pay to have the ad's disabled though :(
This is perfect. I carry mine 24/7. Super fast also. Only downside is the battery life is not good. I have to charge at least once a week no matter how I use the settings/light level.
My 11year old daughter is loving this ereader. It‚Äôs light and portable so she brings it in the car on trips. She also loves to use it in the bathtub as she takes her long relaxing baths. It‚Äôs great so far.
"It's always nice to shop at Best Buy In Tulsa, OK. Had help soon as I walked in till I left. Salesman was very up to date on the newest Kindle Oasis."
The screen is very nice. The design is perfect as it fits to your hand. Can flip page smoothly
The Oasis has a very sleek design that is very comfortable in hand. The flat transition from screen to bezel is very attractive. Backlight is great and its nice to be able to have it adjust automatically or manually. Menus are easy to access an understand. Wifi works great. The print looks very nice and easy easy on the eyes. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is due to the relatively high price.
"Like a lot of reviewers here, I struggled to find the right Bluetooth keyboard to go with my Kindle Fire HD. In the end, I decided to go with the Amazon one, figuring that because Amazon made the Fire and the keyboard, there would be fewer potential problems. At first, this was a good theory. I opened the keyboard as soon as it arrived and paired it immediately to my Kindle Fire HD. There were no problems and it worked perfectly.At first.Unfortunately for me, the next time I worked with the keyboard, I was on a plane trip. I decided to get some writing done (I write novels in my free time) and fired up the keyboard and the Fire. But this time, the keyboard wouldn't pair. At all. The Fire SAID the Keyboard could be paired -- it remembered they had been paired before -- but it just wouldn't pair it. I tried everything I could think of, including pressing the connect button on the keyboard several times to re-pair it. In the end, I had to give up. Instead, desperate to use the flight to write, I borrowed my wife's iPhone 4S. Oddly enough, that had NO problem connecting to the keyboard and I was writing in no time (albeit on a smaller screen and in the notes mode).When I arrived on vacation, I was worried I had a lemon on my hands. Sure, the keyboard worked, but not with the Fire, only the iPhone. That wasn't the plan. I noticed that other reviews said that the keyboard worked initially with the Fire and then wouldn't work again. I thought there was a major glitch.I decided to keep messing with it and discovered this problem and solution. If you ONLY pair the keyboard with the Fire, you will have no problems"
"Using this with my Samsung Galaxy Note. Overall works fine, even though I'm on Gingerbread and not 3.0. Slim and lightweight. Pairs instantly. Some specialty keys don't work, but I'm not concerned as its purpose is just to get in text. This keyboard is much faster than the on-screen keyboard for inputting text.However, Amazon does not sell a case for this keyboard. This is a perfect travel keyboard, but carrying it bare in my day bag concerned me. I did a LOT of searching for some kind of generic slip case that would fit. Nothing.Then I stumbled on the Domke protective wrap, which is just a square of padded material with Velcro at the corners. It's designed for wrapping cameras and lenses. The 11 square fit the keyboard perfectly. I took it down to a local tailor shop and for 3 they sewed up the long side of the square when folded over on itself and one of the short sides creating a slip case. The protective wrap has a soft felt-like side and a nylon side. I folded it with the soft side on the inside. Now I have a perfect slip case for the keyboard, and for just about 15 (12 for the wrap from Amazon and 3 for the sewing)."
"It's a bit smaller than Apple's wireless keyboard but still easy to type on. Comes with 2 AAA batteries. Has a physical on/off switch and also a button to push for paring. Would be great if it came in white color. Works great on my iPhone and PC.****Update Dec. 8****Since many people are asking: It works with any bluetooth enabled device that supports HID (which 99 of the devices out there supports already). I have tested it with iPad 2, iPhone 4S, Windows 7 laptop, Macbook Pro, Blackberry Playbook and Asus Transformer."
"I'm typing this review on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 using this BT keyboard. I never would have attempted to type a review without a keyboard like this.I've had great luck with it. It paired up quickly and hasn't given me any trouble. The Kindle recognized it and gave me a 4 digit code to enter. I typed the code on the keyboard and it paired right up.I've been using this on the commuter train when I travel and it's really fantastic. I read the other reviews and see where others had trouble. I assume these kinks have been worked out in the Kindle software, because it's working great for me.A couple of nice things about the way it works with the Kindle Fire HD:* Once the BT keyboard is paired, the soft keyboard no longer displays on the screen when you're in a text field. This leaves you with a lot more viewable space on the screen.* You can navigate through the screen with the arrow keys and press enter to activate a button. Tapping on the screen is still faster, but it's nice to have the option to navigate either way.* The Home and Menu buttons work great on the Fire. From any screen, press the Home button on the keyboard and it takes you to the Fire's home page."

"I waited to get this keyboard until I did a little bit of research, and I think that made all the difference. In the time it took me to do the research, Amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the Bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having. A lot of the one-star reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadn't been solved yet.The keyboard itself has all the keys you'd expect: alphanumeric keys, up, down, left and right keys, and a few extra, like keys for the volume and a Home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen. However, there are a few curious omissions:1) No Page Up or Page Down2) No Delete key. (There's a Backspace key, but that's not the same thing.)The keys are well-spaced and it's not a problem touch typing on the keyboard. It's certainly not as spacious as a full-sized keyboard, but it's about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptop.The one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it. It's a perfect portable size, but it's not something I would want to store in a backpack. I will probably keep the box it came in for travel purposes."
"Since the details for the items are a little sparse I thought I would provide the specs listed on the power adapter.AC Input 100-240 Volts, 0.15 Amps, 50/60 HzDC Output 4.9 Volts, 0.85 AmpsThis adapter has a Flextronics part number of 09500043-200, Model A00810"
"I was initially happy that my Kindle replacement charging cord arrived so promptly, it seemed to work fine. But after only one use, the outer covering of the cord started cracking falling off in bits. It now is almost completely covered by electrical tape, as the bits fall off w/ each every use. I will end up having to buy a new one after all..."
I bought the Kindle when I was in the USA but on my return to Australia I discovered I left the power adapter behind in my condo in the USA. For some reason Amazon cannot or will not mail a replacement cable to Australia so now I'm unable to re-charge my Kindle as the Micro USB cables available in Australia do not fit the Kindle as it is tiny compared to the ones available here.I would say this is one huge draw-back of this particular USB power adapter.Other than that it works great to re-charge the Kindle.Luckily I do have some friends in the US and one of them is willing to mail the replacement cable to me in Australia. Hopefully this will work out OK or else I will have no choice but to wait until I get back to the US at the end of the year.
"I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing.... I have both the original Kindle and the Kindle2, and I love the product, but with this adapter, I have to ask.... Why"
"Can someone explain to me why I can find hundreds and hundreds of people with this disintegrating isulation on charging cord problem, but not ONE post from Amazon with an official Company Statement about these defective, inferior, slave-labor built, imported, crap charging cablesAnyoneI'll be you dollars to donuts that these 100s of complains will bloom into 10s of thousands, as the existing, bad cables mature. (dry out, degrade, undergo radioactive decay, whatever their issue is). I'll bet I'll win!"
"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.
I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.
"bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier."
This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)
"Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great."
I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
"A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing."
"Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday..."
The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped."
"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well
The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!
My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.
"My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!"
Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
"This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!"
"I've owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn't disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don't expect it to be a top of the line tablet."
"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed.
"I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!"
"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
"I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
"Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!"
I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device .
Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online.
"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste."
"This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems
"If you are using Amazon Prime, you definitely like this table as it can stream the video, audio, reading book... easy to carry with you"
Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.
"Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!"
The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.
this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal
I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.
I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!
We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!
"Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones"
Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it
Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
"I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up."
Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
"The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great."
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it.
Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
"Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere."
"A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why."
4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.
I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.
I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!!
I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
"It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it."
"Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot."
"I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it."
"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
"We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10"" version."
Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure
Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation"
"Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!"
"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely."
"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire.
"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!
This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life."
"If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed
Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy
asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch.
"Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc."
Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.
Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price
Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution
I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.
I have been using this for a bit now. It's wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer.
I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account
"No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem"
Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints
"Sweet tablet yo, does good work for my grandma and super easy"
This is a great little tablet especially for the price.
This is an awesome product love the flexibility it has with not only book reading but other apps as well.
"this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse"
"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!"
This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful.
I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need
I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend!
Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!!
Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her.
Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.
"Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed."
Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages
Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video.
Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.
"My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working."
Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.
"Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices."
Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix
"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!"
Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat.
I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price
"Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet."
"Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far."
Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too.
Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone.
"This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend."
"This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all!"
Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly
Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse
If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad
My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.
Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it's a grade little tablet!
Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!
Like this so much bought another one for my daughter.
The granddaughter loves it and she can't put it down.
"Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games!"
I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating.
Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.
LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for
This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!
Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.
"Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults."
"Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos."
"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
"Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
"I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift."
This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
"Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa."
very good product in its price range affordable and very good
We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
"This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds."
"Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing."
Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price.
"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
"This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it's worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:)"
"I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance."
Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.
"I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader."
"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user."
It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast..
Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.
Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
"Bigger screen, longer battery life and faster loading...an improvement over the last model and a great choice if this is your first tablet. As a college student, it beats spending more on books and having to lug the extra weight on my back"
This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
"Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything"
"Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc"
"Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it
Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school.
"The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
"Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids."
the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os
I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn't hurt his eyes like the iPad.
"HD 8"" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included."
I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.
I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
"Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it."
Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.
Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!
Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
"My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did."
"Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device."
"Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night."
Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .
Better then the older models bigger and better then before
Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names."
"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it
"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions."
"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot
Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again!
Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps.
"Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon."
I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.
I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I've had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job.
it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.
"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
"This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.
"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
ƒ∞t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance
Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.
Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.
"This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!"
I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.
"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update
Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
"This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.
Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
"Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer"
I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system
Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!
Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!!
Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
"My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled."
This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs .
good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
"Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work."
We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
"Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
"Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well..."
"Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight."
"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast.
Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn't have with my old kindle.
Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
"Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it."
"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
"It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it"
Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.
Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion
I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further.
"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.
"Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read."
"love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone"
"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
"BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"
Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great
Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!
Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can't beat the price!
"Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark"
Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.
"Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight."
Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!!
"I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read."
I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem!
"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it
Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it
My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well
Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading
The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids
This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues
This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere.
We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.
"We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well......"
"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group."
still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size.
Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it.
Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.
My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!
"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining
"My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift.
Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
"I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
"it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly
This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
"I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer."
Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games
This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.
"I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!"
Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling.
I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.
Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
"I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok"
"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
"this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I'm not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more."
purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up
"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
"I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."
It's easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot
this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders
The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy.
As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose
Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.
"I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails."
I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.
I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know
"Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework"
"like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader."
"My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best."
the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time
Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work.
"Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ)."
Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.
This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech.
Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire.
We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price.
Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!
"bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied."
I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend
"I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor"
"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat."
For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time
I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.
"I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use."
The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
"I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it."
"This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
Easy to use and great value. Excellent viewing with good color
"Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot."
"I'm not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more."
"I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase."
"Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!"
This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.
This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It's very responsive and the screen resolution is great.
"Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading...
Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
"great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products."
"I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet"
"I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far."
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.
The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
"Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8"" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended."
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied.
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.
"I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too."
"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
"I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster."
The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable.
"Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
"Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend."
With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!"
Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.
Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.
For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube
"I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but I don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value."
"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
"Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value."
"Upgraded from a6"" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don't think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size."
"Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!
"The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift,"
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.
"I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating."
I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
"With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
"I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions."
"Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet."
"bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this."
My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
"I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!"
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon!
First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures!
"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
"The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
"It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side."
"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time"
The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.
Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
"Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life"
I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues.
I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
"This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended."
We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member.
I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product.
"seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1"
The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
"The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
"The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets."
"Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but"
I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics.
"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.
I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming."
Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
"The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great."
Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it.
Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great
I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot.
"Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
"I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don't need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well."
She says this was the best gift she ever received.
"purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!"
"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned...."
"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.
"This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!."
Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
"Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle."
Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets."
"My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great"
Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it
"Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media."
"I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty."
"very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.
Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.
Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.
"This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price."
This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..
"This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook"
Bought for our son so he wouldn't have to carry books back from his deployment
"This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!"
Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!"
My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.
"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.
"About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good"
blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading
I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear.
"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle."
I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it
I use it everyday after work for down time.........
It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use.
It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks
"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product"
Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down.
nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely!
This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
Needed an¬†inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
"Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
For what it does it's great for me a good alternative
Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend
It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.
At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.
Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
Great product for surfing the internet or reading books!
I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.
"Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email."
Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles
I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
"Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot."
This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music.
This is a very good product my kids do homework on it
"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
"I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit."
I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights
"Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed."
I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
"The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money."
its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.
Great graphics for price compared to other brands.
It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.
ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price."
Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work.
Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
"I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!"
"Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books."
"Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable...."
Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
"Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage.
Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
"Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
I'd recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use.
"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge..."
The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.
"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
"I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features."
Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
"Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I'm a fan of Silk, but it works well enough."
good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.
"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old."
This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
"my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use"
Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
"This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine."
"Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great!"
"the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
Good product with best price available in the market place
Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile
I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
It was great product. the price which I got it was great.
This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.
"Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don't like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory."
Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
"I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc."
Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ‚Äãis a very functional and easy to use.
"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
"Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer"
"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far.
Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it
Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for.
"Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits."
Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
"Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.
Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it
"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
"Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books.
I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.
My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.
"Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use."
performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
"This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal.
"We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value."
We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.
Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
"We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids."
If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
"I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use."
"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games."
Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
"Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
"Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more.
Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet.
"Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost"
"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps"
"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet
"My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product.
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value."
"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
"Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
"Very happy with the Kindle tablet! Bought it to replace an old Kindle tablet. Great tablet, serves the purpose well. Basic browsing, netflix and amazon videos.Only issue is my older tablet had a mini hdmi not this one, so screen connect is only through Amazon echo.Still a good tablet!"
Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.
We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.
Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.
Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.
"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
"Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading."
overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice
"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
"This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle."
This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right.
"Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa"
Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful
Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.
For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus."
It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.
Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying.
I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?
Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down
My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad!
Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak
My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day.
I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download.
"awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone"
"Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it."
Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job
Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.
Great device very functional love it will recommend
Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.
"great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price"
Great products as usual and great customer service
Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do.
I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it
I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her
I like this and the price is right enjoying it now
I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.
I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one
It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it.
It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.
It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web
It's works really well and don't have any issues at all
Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don't have a tablet or never used one
Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school.
My wife got this for her Kindle books so she can read on the go
My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase.
Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.
"Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight."
"Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for."
The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
"The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
This is a very responsive device for the amount paid
This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.
Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad.
"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
"I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product."
Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members
"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it.
"I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!"
Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
I love ordering books and reading them with the reader.
Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
"With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time."
"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.
I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.
"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
"Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price."
I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet.
"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!"
Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
"So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone's battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :)"
Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job's Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books.
My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
"this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range"
Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use
Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.
The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7.
"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun."
Best bang for your buck............................
Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.
I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE!
"i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics"
"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
"If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else."
Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.
My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.
"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
"Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue."
I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use.
I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
"Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price."
Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy!
"I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet!"
"I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad."
Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus
I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it!
"I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7"" for my wife that afternoon!"
I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.
"It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating."
This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.
Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I'm very happy with this purchase!
"Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone ""barrows"" a cable."
This is the first tablet i have owned and i must say it runs great. And the battery lasts for a good amount of time. Cant complain when it comes that cheap.
They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks.
"Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it."
We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity
Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet
Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.
"This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered."
I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.
Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
"Better then a E-book, more options and versatility"
"Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break."
Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews.
I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
"This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!"
This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has
This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
"Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload."
Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
I've had kindles since they first came out love it
Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet.
"This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
"Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable."
"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
"Easy to load, works with our local library (borrow books for free)."
Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
"the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended"
Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
"I recieved this as a present for my birthday, so far it has been great. I have bought several books and it makes a great Ebook reader."
"If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!"
"Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps."
I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.
"This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to."
This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.
"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
"I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!"
"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.
Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.
This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!
"This watch is not only very useful, it's very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the ""smartwatch"" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least."
Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on
"Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference."
"I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned."
This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.
It is very handy great when i don't want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere
I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy!
Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet."
I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps
My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it.
I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!
"I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch"
I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children
My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available.
It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!
We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents.
"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.
"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it‚Äôs great for entertainment."
"I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve."
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money.
"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features!"
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet
Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great.
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.
"Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips"
Great buy for my 7yr old cheap so if it ends up broken for any reason I can replace it easily.
I bought four of these for my kids and they love them
I bought this for Christmas and my 10 year old loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!!
love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table
"My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera"
Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There's ways to switch it to kid friendly
This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.
This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely.
Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!!
"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."
Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web
Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on.
"I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials."
Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.
Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there.
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no ""accidental"" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts."
Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it.
"Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day"
She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games
Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use.
"this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it."
The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also.
Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
Got this tablet for my mom who isn't very tech savvy. She loves it. Can't beat the price
This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle
This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching
"I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music."
This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.
"Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size"
The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good.
also great for listening to music and also for movies
Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE
"Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!"
"I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd."
Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it.
Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.
So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book
This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies!
This is the best thing for reading specially on the go.
Great size and storage for reading my online books
"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse"
"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need"
Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality.
"Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go!"
Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great!
I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel.
This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet.
"Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved ."
"Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available."
I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids
I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.
Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good.
"great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either"
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
"I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
"The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
This is a great little tablet for what you're paying for it! Gets everything done that I need it to
Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.
This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.
It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.
"I've had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick."
I love this tablet! It's the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable!
Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email.
Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.
It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet
I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles.
"Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read."
"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children
"Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features."
After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It's the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday!
Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic.
Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted.
"I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!"
My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life
My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet.
Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts' content. They ar ed really fast too.
Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it!
Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.
This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers!
I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it.
I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad.
I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.
"Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can't wait until he opens it"
I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.
I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it!
"Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free ""May Day"" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time."
Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!
Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family.
"I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it!"
Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages.
"I got an 8"" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift."
Got two for my mom's and they love it. So many great features!!!
Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use
"I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!!"
"This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money."
Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
"This 8"" tablet is much better than the older 7"" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version."
I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.
"Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again."
"Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."
"This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size."
This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend
Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!
Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.
I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife.
It works great for all my needs to check my emails
Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one.
This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small.
This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you.
This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.
In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price
I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!!
Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it.
Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her.
"For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great,"
"I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate."
"I love to read! Books,books, books and more books."
I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!
Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it.
Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family
Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane
"This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter."
This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.
"Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone."
I'm loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more.
"The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it"
It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use.
It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product.
if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside .
Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.
I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.
"Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv."
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
"No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well."
I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.
It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.
"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !
This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.
"Small and compact, surprisingly good image and sound."
I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed.

Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank."
My daughter gets great use with this tablet. She loves to read so she gets best of both worlds. She can get her books and surf the web. Fsntastic buy

The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.
Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.
The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
"This was purchased for my 9 year-old to play games, watch movies, and read on. When we set it up, I was extremely impressed with the quality that we got for the price! It's processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it's very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price."
"Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price."
"Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price."

"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies""."
Can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win.
I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.
Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun

We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.
"Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It's great for the price we paid. If you're a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on."

"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places."
"Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn't have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD.

Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead.
"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it."
Great little tablet. Inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry.

I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.
"I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase."

Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.

"Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet."
"The 8"" version is much better than the older 7"" version. Better graphics and faster processor"
The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.
"The Kindle/Amazon Fire HD Tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything I want from a tablet. Easy to use, easy to read and easy to pay for. A great tablet"
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things.
The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn't stand up - hate it
The tablet works just great and the price can't be beat!
They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro
"this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school"
This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.
This is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.!
This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members.
This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.
This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price.
"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful."
This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps.
"This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing."
This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it's thin and easy to hold.
"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)"
This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase
this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I'm aiming at! Easy to use and can't beat the price.
This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling.
This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome
"This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8"" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop."
very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months
Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.
Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it's HD and user friendly.
WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE!
Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice
We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great.
We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends
"We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better."
"works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos"
"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle"
You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
"Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity."
"I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I've enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas."
"I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for."
"I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8"" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too."
"Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot."
Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal.
This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.
Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow.
Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too.
The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos
Upgraded from a standard kindle to a kindle fire. Lots more features and about the same price.. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a tablet but doesn't want to pay a lot of money..
This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.
My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.
This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven't used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice.
I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.
Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content.
Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature
"We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa."
This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.
"Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy."
"I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection."
This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!
"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it."
This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is.
I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it.
Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all.
"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!"
Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well
"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!"
Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again.
"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube."
Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!!
"I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen's not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can't be beat."
"I bought this for my wife to replace her 7"" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage"
The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price
"8 years old daughter is happy with this tables,work very well with wifi and is easy to download app."
Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books.
"Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use"
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.
Got this for my kid. Great cheap tablet. Camera aren't so good but usable. Apps load quick.
"great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value."
It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.
My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn't have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet.
got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied
"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!"
"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.
The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person!
"Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long."
My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid!
Has worked out well. Very user friendly. Would buy again. Great price as well.
"Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe."
Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn't be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store.
"I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself."
Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child
I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features!
I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!
This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality
"Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games"
I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.
"Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse."
I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It's fast and easy to use.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video."
Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.
"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."
We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!
I was always an IPad person but after having this I'm fine with it. It's easy to use and inexpensive.
I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody.
"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price."
"Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand."
A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.
Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.
I like this tablet it's easy to use Easy for the kids
"Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it."
"For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet."
I am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for me and easy to read and use.
I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment.
I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again.
it's a great tablet for the money. I would buy another.
Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do.
"Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality"
Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet.
"Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints."
Can't beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display.
"Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games."
"Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job."
Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
"I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough."
"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price."
"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps."
"I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10"" tablets before, and this one is just the right size."
I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.
"impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate"
It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."
"My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it."
Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.
Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!
"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
"The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it)."
This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children.
"This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent!"
This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.
"This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the ""Amazon Android"" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!"
Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.
We love this tablet. I bought it for my 4 and 6 year old daughters for Christmas. They have been able to used them with ease.
You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
"this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera"
"I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience."
"Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet."
"My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable."
"Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!"
"A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled."
"For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve."
Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected.
"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.
"This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already."
This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around.
I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since
"My boys love their new tablets due to the cool features, books, apps and games. I love the parental controls, processor speed, battery life and light weight. Combined with a great discount at Best Buy and you get a win, win, WIN!"
This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment.
great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend !
"Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth"
"Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon's OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great."
"I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook!"
Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house.
I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."
"This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases!"
"I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks."
"The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes."
"Good tablet for book reading and audio books, many good apps to chose from. Very good for picking up e-mail when traveling. I'm still finding more ways to use it. Only had it about a month."
"This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet."
This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it!
I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books.
"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
"Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge!"
Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun!
Great tablet for children and for entertainment...
"Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!"
Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display
"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!"
I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet!
"I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!"
This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning.
This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up.
Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!!
I've enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games.
did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product.
This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!!
This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad's though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an Instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle.
Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.
Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies.
"Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away."
"We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year."
Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym
Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"
My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted.
"Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!"
"The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task."
I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb.
"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
"I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
"Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia""."
Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.
Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle
"Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
"Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing."
"I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations."
I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.
"I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself."
It's a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy
"My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,."
PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
"Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores."
The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad
The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
"This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime."
Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift
Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds.
Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.
I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.
Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device!
"It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
"Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights."
This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage
"The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness."
"My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time."
"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
"Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend
Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it!
Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!
Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.
This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it.
"I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!!"
Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
"This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged."
Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.
Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag.
"great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
"Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around"
"This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc."
"Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild."
Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use
Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.
"very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead."
I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.
"I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use."
This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.
The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.
"This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price!"
"It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person."
Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it.
The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.
I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library.
I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.
My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.
I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.
I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price
"I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!"
"The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn."
i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!
I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.
The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
"I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
"I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc"
This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all.
My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them
I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's
I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.
Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
"This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will."
"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.
"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others
A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road."
One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
"I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well."
"I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
"This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there."
I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.
This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.
"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
My grandson loves it . He was very happy with it .
It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person!
My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.
"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
It's alright to browse the Internet and watch videos.
I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.
My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better
I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions.
It's nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug.
Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.
The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it
Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.
my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
"My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults."
Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it
"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
"I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one."
"I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!"
This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it's just as advertised.
Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great.
Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.
"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around.
"It's a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too"
"Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate."
Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.
Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.
great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.
I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.
This is really nice and has great clarity I like it.
This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it
Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase.
This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours.
"Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too."
Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.
I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up!
Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.
"My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect."
This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!
"This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen.
Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks
Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!
"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
"These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well."
This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to
I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate.
This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.
"This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I've bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options.
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!!
Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.
love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.
"Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with!"
"I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books...."
I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
"My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the ""shiny new toy"" is fun."
"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
"I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!"
Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can't bet this tablet for any price!
Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).
This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it
i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc√© downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc√©."
The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.
I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use
We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY
Got it as a present and love the size of the screen
If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!.
I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!!
"I bought the 8"" to replace my old 7"". I love the bigger screen"
Love my Kindle! So when mother table died I brought her this and now I don't get calls all the time to help her figure out where everything is
Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks
Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded.
I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.
Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music.
Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web.
"Best tablet for the money and then some, loads fast, good quality graphics too."

Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.
"Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it"
for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it
Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected.
Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product.
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
"great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,"
"Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price."
Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick.
"Had a paperwhite for years...The fire is my go to for news, new shows, and reading. Good book prices, credible news. Loving it."
"I brought Fire HD8 for my Daughter, She have been used it since Christmas."
I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card.
I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.
I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost.
"I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn't like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out."
I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.
"I traded this in after receiving a 7"" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy."
I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it.
"My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games."
My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.
Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it.
Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.
"wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money."
"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her."
"At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.."
love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service
Can't say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it.
"Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness."
"Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN!"
"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again."
I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options.
"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix."
Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!
This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it
very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.
We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!
Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.
New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.
This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle.
This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.
"I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE"
holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had
Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go.
Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!
This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.
"We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work."
"We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!!"
I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it!
I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;
I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use
Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display
Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.
I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one.
This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera.
Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids
im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!
"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!
"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.
"I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time."
Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.
First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.
It's fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire .
I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose.
We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.
"I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it."
Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.
I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.
I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!
Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.
Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.
"Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,"
Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix
"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!
Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.
Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded!
This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one
"I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you."
"Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked."
Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile!
"Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can't do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product.
I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!
"I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it."
This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.
I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around
"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
"I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase."
Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
"Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available."
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
"I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK."
I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.
Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
"Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books."
I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet.
"Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn't good, I wouldn't be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product!"
"I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price."
I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
.Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet
This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints.
My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now.
Works great for everything we want our daughter to do
I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job
Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise!
"I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest."
It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...
"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it."
This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!
Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere
I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there
I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix
"This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's ""awesome"", which is high praise indeed."
"This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok"
Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly!
My son really likes the larger screen to play games.
I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`
We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.
My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away
"use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet"
"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it!
Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward.
Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!
Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.
"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
"It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally."
This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.
I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.
"Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music."
Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!
My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!
"The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet."
"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading."
My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile.
Amazon continues to offer quality products with the Amazon fire HD 8 for a reasonable price.
Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.
I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.
I purchased this as a gift and I'm had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations.
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!
It's big then the one I had I would tell my friends
My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix!
Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good.
This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user.
Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7.
"This is a nice and cheap android device. HD display and Amazon's sturdy build quality with 10 hours+ battery backup. Sometimes runs a little slow, rest is good"
Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.
"I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet"
Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far
It's a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get
"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it."
i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.
"I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs."
Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience.
"for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain !"
nice tabket for the money with many nice features and durable
Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader.
Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials."
Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.
"Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more?"
"I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!"
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.
Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.
Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop.
"Not an iPad, but that's not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do."
Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment.
PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
"This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable."
"I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it"
the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire
Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.
Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.
Doesn't disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet.
"Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web."
"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading"
I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.
I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display
I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space"
My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games.
"my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger"
"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"
Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.
"We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it."
"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate.
"Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
"Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory."
Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.
Bought this tablet for a relative for Christmas who wanted access to audiobooks. My only issue is that the tablet needs a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps. Not a problem if you have constant access to wifi but my relative does not. Nice tablet otherwise.
An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!
"love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues"
"We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it"
I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me.
This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.
I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet.
"Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading."
"I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it.
This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
"There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding."
"Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
"Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet"
"I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too."
More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
"needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us"
"I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer."
"Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media."
Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member.
I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase.
"This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password."
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket
Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..
Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.
horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
"The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one ."
"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead."
I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I'm disappointed as it's really too big too easily carry around. I've discovered it's not all that easy to use it for reading purposes
"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.
Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking
"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading."
My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.
"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
"Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!"
bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
I'm used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate
Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok
The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet.
Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications.
Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.
Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it's a bargain
It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.
Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.
Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read
I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.
"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
"Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value."
"my 7"" wore out,my 8"" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !"
Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
"Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.
awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use
"Bought as a gift for my Mom. She's so happy. Therefore, I'm happy"
Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere
"For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing!"
Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price.
Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad
I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with
"My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one."
Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around
Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend this to anyone.
Perfect tablet for my 8 year old without spending a fortune. I love how it has parental controls so I can limit his time playing.
This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings
"If you're main purpose is shows, books, light web browsing/social media, and light gaming -- this is the perfect tablet. Very friendly price. Nice construction."
I love it for reading magazines and checking my email.
Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.
Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price."
I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!
"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle.
My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others.
This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.
Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them
This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.
"Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable."
Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants.
Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music.
"If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect."
I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it.
It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.
"My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great."
My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise!
Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price!
"My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy!"
My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.
"Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools."
"After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use."
I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.
Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
"After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet."
This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
This product is easy to use and take along with you
Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list.
"Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze."
My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos.
Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)
Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.
We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
"We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied."
"This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer."
"Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go!"
I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!
Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.
Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected
and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption."
This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device.
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
"Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money"
"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.
Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library."
"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
"Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without."
Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!
This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.
The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.
"And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started."
"This is perfect for him! Bought it as a reader for his books, which we either download from Amazon Prime or the local public library. Nice quality screen resolution, ease of use and durability are a plus."
I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago.
"The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
"This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
"still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too."
"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging."
I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline. Great price.
I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!
My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!
"This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends!"
"A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better."
"Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link"
My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future.
"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction.
Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.
"I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I'm sure I will learn more as needed."
It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
"Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games."
"Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!"
"I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet."
My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!!
"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad."
Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old
It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
"I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did."
"For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic."
"Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet."
Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I've used it a few times and like it.
"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend."
"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
good value for the money ..............................................................................................................
For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
"This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture."
Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing
Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
"After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking."
"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory.
"This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up
"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
"I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience."
So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !
We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!
"bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features..."
"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
"This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don't have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor's or dentist's office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.."
Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
"Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased."
"My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which."
"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
"So much better than my previous kindle, I've used my new kindle daily and I'm not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well"
I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.
Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them.
This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.
"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one."
Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it and uses it every day. She's very picky about electronics and she loves her tablet so it must be good!
daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it.
"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient.
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
"Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale."
Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present
Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.
Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use.
Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use.
This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off
This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do
"I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.."
"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging"
Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.
"I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I've added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of ""free"" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.)"
Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature.
"The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc..."
This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix.
Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well.
Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
"This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!"
The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
"I purchased the Kindle Fire 8"" after owning a 7"" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version."
"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done."
The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!!
"This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly!"
"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc.
i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime
My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome.
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
"Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money."
"It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price"
"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
"I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: ""A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone!"
"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!"
"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
"I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire
The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!
whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge."
Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
"Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
"I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration."
"Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet."
My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use
We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value
"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
"Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners."
"Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use."
"For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective."
Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I'm traveling!!
It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.
Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
"Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,"
This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great.
"Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price"
"Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
"Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi."
"Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children.
"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!"
this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
"I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want."
"First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good!"
Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones."
"Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found."
"The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7."
"This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand."
Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
"I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
"I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the ""educational"" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself."
"I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
"This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones."
"The new tablet is great ÔºÅ nice upgradesÔºÅLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web."
I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly!
"The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
"I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one."
Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
"I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics."
I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them.
Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
"Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person."
"The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful"
"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
It is better than we expected and couldn't be happier.
"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store."
"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books.
Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
"My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one."
We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
"Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well"
"The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn't lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase!"
I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
"This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too."
YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.
"We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range."
"My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it!"
This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well."
"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices.
Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer!
This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.
"I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok."
This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup.
I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!
Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying."
Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!
"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!
"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far."
I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend
"Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it"
Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers
"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
"Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view
Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
"We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals"
So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather
"I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect!"
"the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.
this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon
"Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos."
"This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good."
the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games
I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.
this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.
"Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy."
"its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader."
"Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read
I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.
"Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price."
"This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!"
"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
